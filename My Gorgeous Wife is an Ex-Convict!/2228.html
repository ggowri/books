        <h1>Chapter 2226</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're right. That child pretty much saved Tina and Lina's life!" said Grace. Then, she changed the topic and looked at Kyla. "What about you? What&rsquo;s going on with you and Martin Weiss? Are you really going to divorce him when the baby is born?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla glanced down at her belly and replied softly, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that Kyla was still unwilling to accept Martin Weiss, so she stopped talking about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, only people involved in the relationship knew what was going on. She would support her best friend no matter what she decided.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Kyla wanted to be with Martin Weiss, she would congratulate her with lavish gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Kyla planned to raise the children alone, she would help her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can put away the invitation card for the full moon celebration first. I&rsquo;ll send a car to get Aunt, Nelson, and you on the day of the party," said Grace before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at the invitation for the full moon celebration and gently stroked her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two babies were less than one year apart, but... Tina Stephenson would be the Stephenson and Sweeney families&rsquo; treasure. Her parents would dote on her, and she would be the little princess everyone envied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In contrast, she would be raising her baby alone. The baby would be born without their father's company, just like Nelson. Even though Martin Weiss would occasionally visit their children, their relationship would not be like a normal father and his children where they would spend every day together. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Will the child... blame me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Will they blame me for not giving them a complete family?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled wryly. "I'm sorry I can't give you a complete home, but... I still want you to see the world. I&rsquo;ll do everything I can to protect you and give you lots of love!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tina Stephenson's full moon party naturally attracted a lot of attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Hadwin Stephenson had announced to the media that the baby Lina carried would be the future heir of the Stephenson family before Tina Stephenson was even born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, Tina Stephenson was born with a silver spoon in her mouth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people in the upper class already had ideas. After all, if the Stephenson family liked their sons and they became in-laws with them, their future would be as bright as daylight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, many upper class families were trying to get their hands on an invitation card to Tina Stephenson's full moon party&mdash;especially those with young boys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the day of the party, Grace sent a car to Kyla&rsquo;s store. When Kyla's family arrived at the Reed family&rsquo;s house, Grace was already ready.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had not only prepared formal clothes for Nelson and Kyla but she had also prepared a decent set of clothes suitable for the elderly with Mrs. Corbyn in mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was a child, so he did not need makeup. Mrs. Corbyn and Kyla became stunning under the skilled hands of the makeup artist. In particular, Mrs. Corbyn looked so much younger.</p></div>
