        <h1>Chapter 3150</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda stared at the man beside her, even though she knew he loved her, hearing him say these things in the live broadcast made her heart beat rapidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, in the live broadcast room, Grace's username said, "Valda disappeared for a year because she saved my daughter. My daughter had a problem with her leg, and Valda fell into the water after saving her. She hit a hidden reef in the water. Valda is a friend and a benefactor to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason spoke up as well, saying "Regarding the online defamation of Ms. Valda, the Reed Group will assign someone to gather relevant content and submit it to Ms. Valda."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace and Jason's words clearly show that they are trying to support Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And then, someone spoke up again, "The White Maple Group will also assign someone to collect online comments that defame Ms. Valda and submit them to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, right after that, some netizens dug up the online account of Hadwin, the chairman of White Maple Group, which was mentioned earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Continuing on, Martin from Weiss Group, Barlow Group and Philip from Deer Capital, and George from Gregory Group all appeared in the live stream room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The words spoken and unspoken both indicate support for Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The live stream chat exploded once again. What's going on? Why are so many heavyweights from the business world coming to Valda's live stream room?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is it to save face for Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, someone revealed that Valda and the chairman's wife of Reed Group, Grace, have close relationships with Kyla, the chairman's wife of Weiss Group, Lina, the chairman's wife of White Maple Group, and also with Simon, the heir of Gregory Group from Deer Capital. The reason why Philip, the chairman of Barlow Group, is standing on Valda's side is because the Barlow family has a good relationship with the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, many onlookers were stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So it turns out these people are speaking up not because of Brian's connections, but because of Valda!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This powerful network of relationships is enough to make Valda successful even without Brian's support. Moreover, the Reed family has publicly declared Valda as their benefactor, which further strengthens her position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, as Tracy watched the scene in the live broadcast, panic finally appeared on her face!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She did investigate, and found out that Valda is just an ordinary comic artist. How could she possibly have any connections with so many big shots?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially...Valda's disappearance and her leg injury are both related to the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's to save the child of the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Valda is a benefactor of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is bad. Valda has completely cleared her name, but what about her? Not only did she offend Brian, but now she has also offended the Reed family behind Valda, as well as others who support Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, what about her future...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy can't even imagine what will happen next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The parents of the Barlow family also watched the live broadcast. The old Mrs. Barlow exclaimed anxiously, "Why is this happening? If... if Valda was trying to save the Reed family's child from the beginning, why didn't she say so earlier?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think that the wealthy and powerful would speak of such matters lightly?" Old Mr. Barlow seemed to have been mentally prepared for this and knew that with his daughter causing such a commotion, there was no chance of salvaging the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So...so what should we do?" urgently asked Mrs. Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We can only go abroad to avoid the situation for now, and then figure out a solution," said the elderly Mr. Barlow. Fortunately, he had already transferred some money overseas beforehand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The entire Barlow family's business is here in Emerald City!" said the elderly Mrs. Barlow. If they were to go abroad, they wouldn't have the same lifestyle as they do now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now we can only do this. The company is being investigated, and with Tracy causing a scene, it's likely that the relevant departments will investigate even more thoroughly. We might not even be able to leave even if we wanted to!"</p></div>
