        <h1>Chapter 2045</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla paused a little before saying, "Best friend? Is it your business partner..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, so I left and opened my own shop because I couldn't face them anymore," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That man was never your friend. Real friends don't do things like that. Look at it from a different angle. At least you got to see his true colors." Kyla consoled him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, at least I saw his true colors," Chase Harper said in a mutter and then asked Kyla, "What about you? How are things between you and Nelson's father all these years? Why is he letting you run a little store like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew that Nelson's father was Martin Weiss. The head of Weiss Group was wealthy, and he even knew that Martin Weiss had donated his liver to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He thought Kyla would lead a rich life with Martin Weiss, but now it seemed that she was making a living off running the store. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm me, and he's him. I make my living running the store, and I'm happy with it," Kyla said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious and don't mean anything. I..." Chase Harper said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "It's nothing. Nelson's father and I have nothing in common. Maybe it's best if we never see each other again for the rest of our lives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, there was suddenly a commotion in the play area. Several boys younger than Nelson surrounded Nelson and Juliet, shouting, "Wow, he's deaf. He's deaf! I know that thing is called a hearing aid. Only deaf people wear it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Wow, is this girl deaf too? Where's her hearing aid? Where is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A little boy tried to find the hearing aid by Juliet's ear as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn grabbed his hands. "Leave her alone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Can deaf people talk? Oh yes. You can't speak once you lose your hearing aid!" With that said, several other little boys also crowded around Nelson, mischievously trying to take off his hearing aid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Juliet was so mad she started crying. She even tried to help Nelson push away the boys with her small fists as she cried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she was too small. She was pushed down by those little boys in the blink of an eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson's expression changed as he got into a fight with the kids. Juliet cried as she got up and joined the fight again, ignoring her small size.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The staff in the play area rushed over to pull the children apart. Kyla and Chase Harper also rushed into the play area right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson picked up Juliet, who fell to the ground. The little one wrapped her hands around Nelson's neck. Even if Chase Harper wanted to hold her, the little one refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla watched nervously to see if the two children were alright. Fortunately, the children were younger and weaker than Nelson. Nelson was unhurt, while Juliet was also safe even though she had fallen several times because the play area was full of cushions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The children were the ones who caused trouble, so they said nothing. Several parents also hurriedly left with their children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Coming out of the play area, Juliet sobbed as she said, "Why did they call Nelson deaf?"</p></div>
