        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina felt dizzy all over, and before she could get up, the man's body had already covered her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hands and wrists were pressed against the top of her head by him, and he lowered his head, spraying hot breath on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina... "He hoarsely called out her name, with endless desire in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina stared blankly at Chandler in front of her, this was the first time she had seen him like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although his eyes were filled with desires for her when the insect-infested him in the past, there was also too much pain mixed in his desires at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's a bit different from now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knows that this is because of the effect of the medicine, and now he is more instinctively controlled by his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But did he ever look at her like that before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of gaze did he use when he was with her before she lost her memory?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he also looking at her with such a strong gaze in bed at that time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that unconsciously, she is filled with curiosity about the lost memory, wanting to retrieve those memories of being with him, wanting to know how they loved each other and how they got along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just relying on others' information, relying on those photos and videos, is no longer enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath and said to the man in front of her at the moment, "It's okay, you can do everything you want."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because this is what she wants, hoping to conceive his child and relieve his pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to her surprise, Chandler suddenly released her hand and slapped himself directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's eyes suddenly froze. What is this situation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had lost his sanity before, but now it seemed like he had regained some of his composure: "Tina... hurry up now, don't worry about me, it could be a bug outbreak... it's just a bit different from before, but there's no major problem."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A short sentence almost exhausted all his strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The problem is, she doesn't even want to leave now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Chandler, who was now exerting utmost restraint, Tina could only turn passive into active, and with a movement of her body, she suddenly thrust Chandler back onto the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to leave, Chandler. You hear me clearly, I don't want to leave! "Tina exclaimed." Also, I love you. If you really have no feelings for me and don't love me at all, then you can push me away now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's body was trembling, not only because she was desperately suppressing her instincts, but also because of what she had just said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loves him? Does she really love him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not because of sympathy and pity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can he push her away? Are you really willing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Are you willing to push Tina away from repeatedly saying she loves him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if one day you regret it again, what should I do? "He struggled. At that time, could he still have survived without harming her sanity?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There won't be that day, if I have to regret it, unless I die! "Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler furrowed his brow and said, "Don't say the word death."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he thought of the uncertain period of her life and death, he would feel a wave of fear in his heart, no matter what, he would only want her to live well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I won't talk anymore, so you're not going to push me away! "Tina said, actively lowering her body and pressing her lips onto Chandler's lips.</span></p></div>
