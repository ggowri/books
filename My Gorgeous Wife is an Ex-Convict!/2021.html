        <h1>Chapter 2019</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was happy to have Sis around!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper was very unhappy at the birthday party because she did not see William. She had been looking forward to seeing what present William would give her at the birthday party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was her first birthday since she became friends with William!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Are you upset?" Grace asked her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mommy, why isn't William here?" asked Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace knew why. William's existence was already a controversy to the Reed family. If someone with ulterior motives publicized it, it would only cause greater harm to the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"When we came out today, didn't William say he didn't like crowds so he didn't want to come?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper pouted. "If I had known he didn't like crowds, I would have invited fewer people to the birthday party. I don't even know many of the uncles here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace touched her daughter's tiny head. "Do you want William to come to your birthday party, Jasper?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes!" Her little head nodded. "William is my best friend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at her daughter's innocent face, Grace once again lamented children's simple and beautiful world. She only hoped that she and William could still get along well with each other in the future after finding out about the adults' feud and not get affected by the previous generation's enmity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then we'll save William a slice of birthday cake and take it home, alright?" Grace asked gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hearing this, Jasper smiled and said, "Okay! I'll save him a big slice of cake!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the Reed family&rsquo;s house, William was curled up in the corner of his room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper wanted to bring him to the birthday party today, but he said against his will that he did not want to go as there were too many people there. However, he actually wanted to go to her birthday party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After Jasper and the rest left, the servants' children taunted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He's the son of a wicked woman. He can&rsquo;t go even if he wants to!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, he&rsquo;s lucky enough to go to the same kindergarten as Little Young Lady and Little Young Master Mick. Just look at him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Little Young Lady might not know how bad William's mommy is! She might not enjoy spending time with William anymore if she finds out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William was uneasy and frightened as the words rushed to his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Really? Will Jasper stop liking me? Will she hate me for all the bad things my mommy did?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the past few days, he learned things he had not known before from some servants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He only thought his mother had kidnapped Mason, but he learned that his mother was also a murderer who killed her own sister and framed aunt Cummins, putting aunt Cummins in prison.</p></div>
