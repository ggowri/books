        <h1>Chapter 357</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn, who was wearing a necklace that cost 20 million dollars, looked very happy. She felt that she was worth as much as the jewelry that cost 20 million dollars. She did not consider herself an ordinary person anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was now in a new film crew where she starred as the female lead. Although the production crew and director were not as capable as the previous ones, all in all, it was not bad. She was also the female lead, so in this respect, Evelyn was satisfied with the resources Brian gave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyway, as long as she did a good job of sucking up to Brian, she did not have to be afraid of not having good resources in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to her frustration, whenever Brian asked her out, he would always ask her to talk about Grace. She had just about told him everything she knew about Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At times, she felt as if Brian was only letting her hang on to the title of being his girlfriend just to hear about Grace. This made her uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, since Grace had hooked up with Jason, Brian was unlikely to have anything to do with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had inquired about this before. Brian was very particular about his girlfriends. None of his previous girlfriends had boyfriends before him. At least on the surface, they appeared &lsquo;clean&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the high society, it was said that Master Hart never bothered to pick up women who had been touched by other men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Evelyn was secretly glad that she never had a serious boyfriend despite flirting with some men before, whereas Grace was not only Sean's ex-girlfriend, but she was also now dating Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one would believe that she was innocent. She had probably slept with those two men many times before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian would never consider a woman like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reason Brian wanted to hear about Grace's past was probably due to curiosity. After all, it was hard for ordinary people to imagine Jason being attracted to Grace, and Brian and Jason seemed to be close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn had found an explanation for Brian's behavior in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides that, in her opinion, Jason would never take Grace seriously. After all, Grace killed his fianc&eacute;e! Maybe he was doing this now for revenge. He wanted to hold her up high and let her fall down hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not wait to see what Grace would look like when she gets dumped by Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn walked into a high-end club wearing the new jewelry she bought today and a designer dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the club's private room, Brian was drinking with the others as women gathered around him, seemingly trying to attract his attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Evelyn quickly walked up to Brian and softly said, "Sorry I'm late, Brian. I must have kept you waiting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man drinking with Brian smiled and said to Evelyn, "Hey, Master Hart's girlfriend is here. My work here is done. Master Hart had to drink with me because you weren&rsquo;t here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was secretly pleased, thinking that Brian cared about her. "Is this necklace nice, Brian? Thank you for it," she said, raising her chin deliberately to make the necklace stand out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was also for the women around them to know her status in Brian's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This necklace was not one of those cheap necklaces that could be given away casually.</p></div>
