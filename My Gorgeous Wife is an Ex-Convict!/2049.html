        <h1>Chapter 2047</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does she know... how much I long for that warmth?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She used to look at him like that when he had not fallen out with her and misunderstood her for hurting Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Afterward, she looked at him with cold eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss stared at the photos on the computer screen as he raised his fingers and gently stroked Kyla's face. "You said we're even and owe each other nothing, but... is that really true? If we don&rsquo;t owe each other anything, then tell me why I can't get over you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The eyes of the woman in the photo were bright, but they were not directed at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After what had happened in the amusement park, Chase Harper came to the store to see Kyla several times. He brought Juliet with him every time because the little one was always asking for Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I don't know why this kid loves Nelson. She's always asking for Nelson when we're at home too. I'm so sorry for bothering you so often," Chase Harper said with a slight embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's there to be sorry for? Nelson likes Juliet too. The two kids hit it off with each other. It's fate," said Mrs. Corbyn before Kyla could speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two children were in the back of the store. Nelson was teaching Juliet how to read. The words they were reading were Juliet Harper and Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson only wanted to teach the little one to read the words &lsquo;Juliet Harper&rsquo;, but Juliet insisted on learning Nelson Corbyn's name as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Nelson Corbyn wrote his name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nelson Corbyn, Nelson Corbyn, Nelson..." Juliet kept pronouncing the words. She was keener on learning his name than her own name. After reading it out a few times, she even said to Nelson, "I'll keep Nelson's name in mind. That way, I can recognize it the next time I see your name!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn smiled. "Okay, I'll test whether you remember it or not next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla could not help smiling when she saw how well her son got along with Juliet. She could tell that her son liked Juliet too. It was why he would smile like that in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her son used to smile when he met strangers too, but when he got older, he only smiled in front of people he knew well and were sincerely kind to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Thinking of how her son was smiling less and less, Kyla could not help but sigh to herself. Perhaps even if she tried to protect her son, her son still had to face some things himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As her son grew older, he might suffer more injustice and discrimination due to his hearing defect&hellip; There was no way she could stop these. She could only teach her son to be strong when facing these hurdles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, sometimes in the dead of night, she could not help thinking how things would turn out if Nelson had followed Martin Weiss and became the heir of the Weiss family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even with such a defect, no one would dare to discriminate against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Chase, stay for dinner today!" said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh, that's too much trouble," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's nothing. You've been very helpful to Kyla. You wouldn't even accept the repair fee for the tricycle. What's wrong with having a meal with us?" said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper scratched his head awkwardly. "Thank... Thank you, then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After they were done with dinner, Chase Harper left with Juliet. The little one reluctantly said goodbye to Nelson and got into the car with her father.</p></div>
