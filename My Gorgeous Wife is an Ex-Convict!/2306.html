        <h1>Chapter 2304</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla left, and there was a hint of confidence on Jacqueline Bowman's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed to be confident that Kyla would find a way to get her out of this bloody place!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, you&rsquo;d better not let me down!" muttered Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla never thought Amber Mitchell would end up as Jacqueline Bowman had told her&mdash;mad and abused!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In her mind, Amber Mitchell was an independent woman with great skills. Amber Mitchell never told her why she was sent to prison but had taken great care of her back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when she was having difficulty giving birth to Nelson, it was Amber Mitchell who managed to find a doctor to help her survive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Amber Mitchell was released from prison, she gave Kyla her contact information. "You're the only one I&rsquo;m giving my contact information to. Don't give it to anyone else. Feel free to contact me if you face any trouble after getting released. I'll do my best to help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why would you help me?" She could not figure it out. After all, she could not give Amber Mitchell anything in return for her help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the time, Amber Mitchell said with a smile, "Maybe it's because you look like someone who needs help. And I'm soft-hearted. I'm going to get justice for myself after getting out of here. It may take some time, but I'm sure I'll get what I deserve."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla got out of prison a year after Amber Mitchell was released from prison. She contacted Amber Mitchell at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was dressed stunningly, and her pretty face was full of confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell told her that she was doing well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she asked Amber Mitchell whether she got her justice, she smiled and said, "Soon. I'll get my justice soon. Kyla, I'll invite you to my wedding if I ever get married one day!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, it's a deal!" she had said at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Amber Mitchell never contacted her after that. When she dialed the contact number Amber Mitchell gave her, the reply she got was that the number was no longer in service.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After that, she lost contact with Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been trying to track down Amber Mitchell all these years, but she never got a clue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that she finally had one, it was with Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be fine if Jacqueline Bowman was just bluffing, but she was afraid that Jacqueline Bowman was telling the truth. If Amber Mitchell was suffering from such ordeals and was miserable, how could she be deserving of Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s help back then if she did not try to save her now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Kyla went to see Grace. "Grace, I want to ask you something. Is there any possibility of Jacqueline Bowman getting acquitted?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "No way! There's no way Jacqueline Bowman can be acquitted with all the evidence against her&mdash;unless everyone changes their statement and the court follows the principle of presumption of innocence!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's red lips were pressed together tightly as she frowned. "Then... if she gets a lawyer to defend her, what's the best outcome she can get?"</p></div>
