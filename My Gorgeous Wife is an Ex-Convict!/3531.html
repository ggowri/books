        <h1>Chapter 3529</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William stood still, staring at Jasper's departing figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The weight of Lawrence in her heart has not diminished over time, but has become heavier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is the person she sees today really Lawrence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Lawrence is really found, how will Jasper treat him? And what kind of existence will he become in Jasper's heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The future is unknown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this unknown makes him both excited and afraid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper entered the study and found Jason looking at company documents. When he saw his daughter, he smiled and asked, "What's up? Shouldn't you be sleeping at this time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, I don't know if the person I saw in court today was Lawrence, so I want you to help me check," Jasper said straightforwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lawrence?" Jason raised an eyebrow in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper then told his father about what happened before and after seeing that figure in court today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I'll check it out," Jason said. "But if that person really is Lawrence, what are you going to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper blinked, "Of course, I would apologize to him and tell him that I should have answered that phone call."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And then?" Jason continued to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And then...I would be good to him. I would treat him very well. If he needs any help, I will do my best to help him," Jasper replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what if he doesn't forgive you? What if he blames you for everything that happened?" Jason asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's face darkened, "It was my fault in the first place. Even if he doesn't forgive me...it's normal. I will try my best to seek his forgiveness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching his daughter's current appearance, Jason stood up and walked over to her, embracing her in his arms. "You are my daughter, Jasper. You don't need to beg anyone. You also need to understand that if he really blames you, it only shows that he cannot distinguish right from wrong. You have done enough regarding what happened in the past and the Reed family's search over the years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper leaned against her father's embrace. Is it enough... but she felt like she still had a long way to go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, do you think Lawrence will hate me?" She asked with a choked voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, he won't. Weren't you good friends before? He won't blame you. I was just talking casually earlier," Jason said, but a hint of worry flashed in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace found out about her daughter's alleged encounter with Lawrence in court on the second day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could it be Lawrence?" Grace asked her husband.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know, but we should have the investigation results in a little while," Jason said. He had arranged for someone to retrieve all the surveillance footage from that time period at the courthouse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Grace stayed in Jason's office, waiting for the investigation results together.</p></div>
