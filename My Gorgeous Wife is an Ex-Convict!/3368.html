        <h1>Chapter 3366</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So compared to other wealthy kids, my daughter is quite restrained when it comes to spending money. She doesn't spend recklessly and even saves her extra pocket money in a piggy bank every month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, if Tina comes across something she wants but can't afford with her pocket money, she'll naturally act cute and ask her dad and Chandler to buy it for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina probably doesn't buy into Tina's act, so Tina didn't want to bother her dear mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Tina arrived at the exhibition hall, her eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were so many cute Sleeping Cat items, she didn't know what to do. She wanted so many things! But since she only had her pocket money, Tina felt she needed a sponsor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And her friend Chandler was the best sponsor she could ask for!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Chandler," Tina flashed him a bright smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing her expression, Chandler knew she wanted something. "What is it? Do you want me to buy you some Sleeping Cat items?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I knew it! Chandler is so smart! No wonder so many girls in our class like you. They even asked me for your phone number so they could call you!" Tina quickly flattered him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler's face darkened at the mention of the other girls. "So you accepted their gifts and sold me out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina immediately denied it. "No, I didn't! I didn't give them your phone number."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you gave them my email address!" He pointed out the fact mercilessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shrunk her neck a bit, but still tried to explain, "They all gave me Sleeping Cat toys." She just couldn't refuse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">You should know that Sleeping Cat is just too tempting for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, Laura Mond also wants your email address, but even if she gives me more Sleeping Cat stuff, I won't give it to her," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler is speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He naturally knew that she and the daughter of Mond Group were not on good terms, and the two even got into a fight at school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, fights between little girls naturally don't have much impact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But if we talk about the person she dislikes the most in school, then it's definitely Laura Mond!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the two were browsing, they came across a display case. Tina spotted a set of limited edition Sleeping Cat stamps inside the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina's eyes lit up. She had seen this set of stamps online before and had wanted it badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, due to its limited edition, when she saw the price, she was taken aback. The price was not something she could afford with her pocket money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Chandler, can you help me buy it? I really like this set of stamps! But it's so expensive, I can't afford it," Tina said, acting cute towards Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The price of this seal is nothing to Chandler. "If you buy it, you can't tell your classmates any of my information anymore," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I promise!" She quickly reassured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyway, it's as simple for her as eating vegetables.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler walked up to a nearby staff member and said, "Can you help me pack up this set of stamps...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as he was about to finish speaking, another little girl's voice rose up, "I want this stamp set!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler turned his head and looked at the other person. He squinted slightly and recognized the little girl as Laura Mond, whom Tina had mentioned earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Tina saw Laura Mond, she reacted like a startled little kitten, "Laura Mond, why do you always have to take my things!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you doing with that thing? You haven't paid for it!" Laura Mond said, her eyes fixed on Chandler.</p></div>
