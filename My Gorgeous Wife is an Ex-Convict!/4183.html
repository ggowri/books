        <h1>Chapter 4181 No Longer Obedient</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The news of idol star Kit shedding tears at the scene where Tina had an accident quickly became a hot topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This news, like a confirmation of the previous rumors, immediately sparked various discussions online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit's manager was extremely worried. After all, releasing this kind of gossip news at this time would undoubtedly tarnish the reputation of the Hunter family and the Stephenson family, which would be equivalent to offending both families!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When Edmond saw this trending news, he was so angry that he stormed over to Kit and slapped him, saying, "Why did you go there? Don't you know that appearing in such a place will invite endless criticisms? Especially shedding tears in front of so many people, are you trying to tell others that you and Tina were really involved in a vague relationship?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit's face turned to the side, showing the imprint of five fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He suddenly sneered, "Back then, wasn't Father hoping that I could be involved with Miss Stephenson from the Stephenson family so that we could gain better resources? But now, he wishes I wouldn't have any connection with Miss Stephenson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "That was then, this is now!" Edmond said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Unfortunately, it's too late for Father to say anything now," Kit mocked, as the internet was already flooded with gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You&mdash;" Edmond raised his hand again, wanting to slap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit coldly said, "If father slaps me again, then I won't have to act tomorrow. The slap mark on my face won't be hidden even with makeup!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This made Edmond angrily put down his hand, but he still said to Kit, "You better come up with an explanation immediately. Clarify that you have no romantic relationship with Miss Stephenson, that you only consider her a friend. And apologize to the Stephenson family and the Hunter family for the online rumors. We can't let them blame our family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit coldly replied, "What if I don't just consider Miss Stephenson a friend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What?" Edmond was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What if I really have feelings for Tina? Not everything that's being said online is false, at least part of it is true," Kit continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You&mdash;" Edmond stared at his son, suddenly feeling a sense of panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "So, father, I can't do the apology and clarification you asked for. Because I don't want to lie to the public anymore!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He had already told enough lies to survive, to escape from the miserable days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So now, he didn't want to lie anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What do you mean? Are you defying me?" Edmond angrily asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit suddenly smiled, "Yes, from now on, I don't plan to listen to you anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Especially after hearing that the person who harmed Tina this time was Mr. Perkins!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Mr. Perkins, the person father originally wanted him to "accompany," just to obtain resources from him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And at that time, it was Tina who saved him. But the price she paid for saving him was her current whereabouts being unknown, and it had already been such a long time without finding her. She might have already...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If time could be reversed, he would rather have truly "accompanied" Mr. Perkins that night, even if that person did something despicable to him. It would still be better than letting Tina become the target of Mr. Perkins' revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> What did he get from obeying his father's words?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He might have lost the person he loved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So, he wouldn't listen to his father anymore!</p></div>
