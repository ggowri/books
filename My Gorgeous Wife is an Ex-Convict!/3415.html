        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then she froze as he took a scarf directly from her wardrobe, rolled it up, and blindfolded her with it, tying a knot. "This way, you won't feel uncomfortable," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt like the remaining words were stuck in her throat, and she didn't know what to say for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But I guess this can be considered as some progress for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some things can't be resolved all at once, they need to be tackled step by step...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After applying some medicated oil on Veronica's shoulder, Mason suddenly hugged her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" His sudden hug caught her off guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, no matter how old we grow in the future, please don't ever abandon me," he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica couldn't help but smile and raised her hand to embrace him, saying, "How could that be? I am your sister, no matter how old we get, I will never abandon you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sister...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyelashes trembled slightly, but there was no blood relationship between them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How long can we hold on without any blood relation?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day at school, Veronica ran into Daniel again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hesitated for a moment, "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Here, take this!" said Daniel as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a tube of ointment, then handed it directly to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at the other person with some surprise and asked, "What's this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This ointment is quite effective in treating bruises. You can try it," said Daniel. "Also, I said yesterday that I knew you because I heard that you had once bravely saved a child who fell into the water. Girls like you who dare to jump into the river to save others are rare!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was stunned, obviously not expecting that what Daniel had heard was about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, I'm sorry about yesterday. I hope this ointment will help with your injury!" After saying that, Daniel waved and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica held the ointment and looked at Daniel's back as he left, lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Until a voice sounded in her ear, "What are you looking at?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica snapped out of her thoughts and said, "Nothing. What did the teacher ask you to do just now?" She looked at Mason standing next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He asked if I could participate in the class activities for our school's anniversary," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did you respond?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll participate in whatever activities your class participates in," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His response didn't surprise her. It had always been like this since they were young. It seemed like he was just revolving around her. When she was a child and went to school, he would wait for her at the school gate every day, crouching and watching for her to finish school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later, he wanted to go to school with her, so he skipped a grade to study together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Any activity in school or outside tutoring, he would follow whatever she does. If she doesn't do it, he won't do it alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But people are individuals, and is it really good for him to follow her pace like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Mason is happy that her father still likes to stick to her like he did when she was a child, she is also secretly pleased. He always reminds her to hold onto him tightly, because whether the Barlow family will have a good or bad future depends on how long Mason can stay in the Barlow family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she hopes that Mason can become more independent, which would be better for him, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can still participate in the event even if I don't join," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why should I participate in an event that you're not attending?" he asked, seeming strangely puzzled.</p></div>
