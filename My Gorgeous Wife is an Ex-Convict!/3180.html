        <h1>Chapter 3178</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lisa hugged Valda and gently patted her back, saying "It's okay, don't cry, don't cry, we've found each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I've seen it. From now on, you'll be living in Emerald City. I'll take good care of you and be a good daughter to you. If you ever want to go back to the village to visit, I'll go with you to take a look," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I understand. You are a filial child," said Lisa, smiling with her wrinkled face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to years of hard work, Lisa, who is 60 years old, has a head full of gray hair and appears much older than the average person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian drove himself and took Lisa to the apartment that Valda had specifically bought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they traveled, Lisa gazed at the scenery along the way and once again marveled at the prosperity of Emerald City, which also made her a bit nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, she has lived her whole life in the village and is accustomed to the way of life there. Now that she has come to tMason Swansonty, can she really adapt to tMason Swansonty life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon arriving at the apartment that Valda had purchased, Lisa's eyes widened in disbelief as she exclaimed, "This... is where I'll be living?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Auntie, you can stay here or you can stay with me at Brian's villa. Brian said you can stay at either place, whichever one you feel more comfortable with," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;V-Villa?&rdquo; Lisa was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, a villa is like a fairy tale to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm," Valda nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian turned to Lisa and said, "You are Valda's godmother, and now you are also my godmother. Thank you for saving Valda before. In the future, Valda and I will take care of you together as a way of showing our gratitude."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knelt down straight in front of Lisa who was sitting on the sofa and immediately bowed his head to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lisa was shocked and quickly tried to help the other person up, "What are you doing, child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I need it, I really do! You are Valda's savior. If you hadn't saved Valda back then, I would still be living in agony."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian finished speaking and then bowed three times before standing up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lisa's first meal in Emerald City was cooked by Brian himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda accompanied Lisa in introducing the furnishings in the room, as well as explaining how to use various facilities. She also talked about the facilities in the community and nearby places such as supermarkets and hospitals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Brian was busy in the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lisa, listen, she feels a bit dizzy. After all, she just arrived in tMason Swansonty and has been exposed to too much all at once."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, take your time. After a few days, you will gradually become familiar with everything in this room. Then, you can get to know the community and the areas outside of it. When I have free time, I will accompany you. If I am busy with work, Brian will send a caregiver to take care of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Caregiver?" Lisa looked surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, caregivers have some basic medical and nursing knowledge. You already have some age-related illnesses, so with a caregiver to help take care of you, I can also feel at ease," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I don't need anyone to take care of me! I'm just an old lady from the countryside. How much money would it cost to hire a caregiver?" Lisa said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian smiled, "Don't worry about the money. I already said that Valda and I brought you here to enjoy yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lisa nodded after hearing this.</p></div>
