        <h1>Chapter 4025</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy lowered her eyes. Did she not love him anymore?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was just trying to let go of herself. If she really didn't love him, then she wouldn't feel a heartache every time she thought of Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mick loves you. If you don't mind him and still love him, can you give him a chance to be with him again?" Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To be with Mick again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed like a beautiful thing at first, but now, with this dispute over the child in her belly, what will their future be like?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even she herself was not sure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't have to give me an answer now. As Mick's mother, I really hope you can be with my son," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy hesitated and said, "Whether I will be with Mick or not, I will give birth to this child!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aren't you afraid of death?" Grace said. "Or there may be an incurable disease."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy smiled bitterly, "I am someone who has died once. What else is there to be afraid of? Besides--"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She bit her lip slightly, "I know very well that if I give up this child now, I will live in regret for the rest of my life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The unexpected death of her mother had already caused her endless regret and pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">God knows how much she wished time could turn back. If she hadn't had a conflict with Clarissa that day, her mother wouldn't have rushed up and been pushed off the balcony by Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had had enough of this feeling of regret and didn't want to endure it again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at Nancy's resolute attitude, Grace thought of her own past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy is determined to give birth to this child no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And back then, she herself was also willing to risk everything to give birth to triplets!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only those who have experienced such a thing can truly understand that feeling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As long as you have thought through the consequences of this decision, then although I don't agree, I will respect your decision," Grace said. "The Reed family will try their best to help you keep this child, but if it comes down to a situation where only one of you, the child or you, can be saved, then I will make sure the doctor saves you. I hope you understand this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy opened her mouth to say something, but Grace continued, "Nancy, don't underestimate your own life. If you die, what do you think will happen to Mick?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, you rest well. As a mother of four children, I understand your feelings. What I said earlier was a last resort, but now I will try my best to help the doctor save this child for you!" Grace promised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was her promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you," Nancy murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, Mom, why did you promise her to help her keep the child? Don't you know it's too dangerous for her?" Mick shouted at his mother in the hospital lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't yell at your mother," Jason scolded his son with a frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This child is mine and hers. I don't agree to her giving birth to this child!" Mick said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace sighed, "The legal right to give birth is determined by the will of the woman. Nancy has the right to decide whether or not to give birth to the child. This is the right given to her by the law, and no one else has the right to interfere!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p></div>
