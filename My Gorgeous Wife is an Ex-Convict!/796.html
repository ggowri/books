        <h1>Chapter 795</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Is it because I don't like the old man trying to run my life? Is it because my breakup with Grace was just a result of the old man's manipulation?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, the breakup was my decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even if the old man didn't intervene this time, I'll probably still break up with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll be on edge. As long as she has Brian in her heart, I'll be afraid of losing her and that one day I'll suffer Grace's betrayal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Instead of being afraid all day long, I'd better end things myself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's just a woman. It's just a relationship that lasted less than a year! It's nothing to me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said silently to himself, but his chest seemed to begin to tingle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the mere thought of her could hurt him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh? It's Miss Cummins," exclaimed Terrence who was in the front seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was stunned as he looked out of the window almost subconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not far ahead on the edge of the road, the thin figure caught his eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was wearing a gray T-shirt and a pair of jeans. Her long hair was simply tied up in a ponytail. That comely face had become thinner after only a few days. Even the T-shirt on her body looked saggy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man was standing in front of her. She was looking at him with her almond-shaped eyes and a slight smile on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This smile... stung Jason's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I remember correctly, that man seems to be Chase Harper. He used to work in the same Sanitation Service Center with Grace. He even courted Grace before!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face could not help darkening. Suddenly, the car was filled with low pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence, who spoke of it, really regretted it now. 'Why did I say that? Maybe Young Master Reed wouldn't have seen her if I hadn't said anything.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking in the rearview mirror, Terrence looked at Jason's cold face and did not know whether to worry for himself or Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Speaking of which, Young Master Reed has already broken up with Miss Cummins, so now Young Master Reed is&hellip;' For a moment, Terrence did not know what his boss was thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace, who had been chatting with Chase Harper because of her chance encounter with him by the roadside, seemed to feel something and turned her head to look in Jason's direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace caught sight of the familiar Bentley immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a car that Jason used the most, and Grace had ridden in this car many times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car windows were down, but one could not see the inside clearly from the outside, only a vague outline at best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Jason in the car? Did he see me?' Grace thought to herself. Her eyes went to the back of the car almost subconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she then laughed to herself. 'What am I thinking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'There's no more Jay. There's only Emerald City's Young Master Reed, Jason!'</p></div>
