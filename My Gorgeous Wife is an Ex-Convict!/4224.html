        <h1>Chapter 4222</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So it turns out...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what about you? What exactly is the relationship between you and me?" she asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As I said before, you are my fan. You like me, but you made it clear what your liking for me meant." Kit said, "And then, unintentionally, we started to have more contact. Despite knowing that you already had a fianc&eacute; like Chandler, we could not be together, but I couldn't stop myself from falling for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Falling for her seemed to be the easiest thing in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sunshine, honesty, and kindness all made him more and more attracted to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit's eyes showed some hesitation, but he didn't want to lie to her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, when he saw her, he promised himself that he would tell her the truth if she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Later, because I was jealous of your relationship with Chandler, I did something that made you dislike me, so you stopped liking me the way you did before," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She furrowed her brows, "What did you do that made me dislike you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I kissed you against your will," he confessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A suffocating silence filled the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, I know I'm terrible and don't deserve your forgiveness, but I don't know what </span><span>to do to make up for the hurt you've experienced. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today, the words he said the most were "I'm sorry"!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kit, you saved me in the village, and during the car accident, you did everything to protect me and the baby. So, the fact that you lied to me is enough to make amends. But I think we shouldn't see each other again in the future because I don't know how to face you." Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despair filled Kit's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this the consequence of his actions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The consequence of telling so many lies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand," Kit closed his eyes in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he has obtained such a result, he can't blame anyone but himself for his greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So no matter how she treats him, he will accept it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Tina was about to leave the ward, Kit suddenly asked, "How is the child now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, at this moment, is unable to understand the condition of the child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is still in the incubator, but her condition is improving," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying these words, Tina left the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit was left alone in the ward, his face filled with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Tina came out, instead of immediately returning to the ward, she had the nurse push her toward the neonatal ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Through the transparent glass window, she watched the small baby in the incubator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The baby looked even smaller than regular infants and had tubes inserted, appearing so fragile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this fragile little life had been with her all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From when she disappeared in the water, to the small village, and then the car accident!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This little life had never given up, struggling to survive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her child was so strong, what reason did she, as a mother, have not to be strong as well?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Baby, you must be healthy," Tina whispered to the incubator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would also work hard to recover, to welcome her child back into her arms in a good state!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tina was almost at the ward, she heard the sound of an argument coming from inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now that the placenta is gone, what about your illness?" It was the voice of a middle-aged woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my own business!" Chandler's voice came through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can this be just your own business? Don't you know how worried your father and grandfather are about your health? But luckily, Tina has already been found, so once she recovers a bit, you should hurry up and let her get pregnant again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, please stop saying such things!" Chandler scolded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why can't I say it? Your illness..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the woman could finish speaking, Chandler seemed to realize something and turned around abruptly, opening the partially closed door of the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Tina and the nurse pushing her wheelchair outside the ward came into view of the two inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's expression suddenly changed. "Tina, just now we..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He moved his lips as if wanting to say something, but he didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, it was Tina who spoke first, addressing the nurse beside her, "I have arrived at the ward, you can leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," the nurse replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only then did Tina turn her gaze back to Chandler and the woman in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, I am Chandler's mother. I heard that you have amnesia, but regardless, I hope you understand that you are Chandler's wife, and this fact will not change," Adele said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina met the other person's gaze and said, "Just because I'm his wife doesn't mean I must have another child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele stared at Tina and said, "If you have another child, it means Chandler can be cured and no longer suffer. Don't you want that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I have a child just to cure someone, wouldn't that be very sad?" Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele observed Tina's expression at that moment and suddenly asked, "Tina, do you really not love Chandler at all anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Adele's words were spoken, a suffocating awkwardness filled the air!</span></p></div>
