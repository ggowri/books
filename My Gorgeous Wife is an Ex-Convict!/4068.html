        <h1>Chapter 4066</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A couple?" Tina rolled her eyes. "I was wearing men's clothing during the shoot!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That doesn't stop you from looking like a couple! Like two poles, but with an irresistible attraction to each other. It's simply indispensable! It's a pity that your shoot just now may not be selected. If it really becomes a poster, it will definitely cause a sensation!" Eugenia said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're exaggerating!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's true!" Eugenia said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Kit finished shooting, he found that it was already dark outside. When he turned around to search the studio, Tina was nowhere to be found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you looking for?" Kit's assistant asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The person who was shooting with me just now, where did she go?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, she left with her friend when you finished shooting," the assistant replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She left?" Kit lowered his eyes and for some reason felt a faint sense of disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But wasn't she supposed to be his fan?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Usually, if fans have the chance, they would wait until their idol finishes shooting and then come over to get noticed, and try to get closer to their idol, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But why didn't she do that?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is she really his fan?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina hurriedly took Eugenia to a nearby mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, do we have to be in such a hurry? After Kit finishes shooting, at least let me go up and chat with him for a few minutes," Eugenia strongly expressed her dissatisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine, if he has any fan meetings next time, I'll do my best to get two tickets and go in with you to meet him up close and let you chat with him, okay?" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's more like it! But why did you bring me here?" Eugenia looked puzzled!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The floor they were on was the men's clothing section!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if they really wanted to go shopping, it should be the women's clothing section, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you buying clothes for Chandler?" Eugenia guessed after thinking for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I'm buying clothes for myself," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? You bought men's clothing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia was a bit confused. "Why did you buy men's clothing for yourself? Do you have another shoot where you have to provide your own men's clothing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was your words just now that reminded me," Tina said. "Didn't you say that when I'm shooting with Kit, we look like a couple? And didn't you also speculate that Chandler might be interested in men, which is why he rejected me? So I thought, why not try wearing men's clothing and see if Chandler is interested."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Eugenia felt like she couldn't keep up with her friend's thought process. "But what if Chandler is attracted to you in men's clothing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then when we're intimate in the future, I can dress up in men's clothing too!" Tina shrugged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You really are... um, open-minded!" Eugenia didn't want to ask how Tina wasn't worried about what would happen if Chandler really was only interested in men. Even if Tina could dress up like a man, she still wasn't a man!</p></div>
