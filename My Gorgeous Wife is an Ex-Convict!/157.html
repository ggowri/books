        <h1>Chapter 156</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Wait..." Grace suddenly shivered. She looked at the man with even more confusion. How... how had he known that the bracelet was with her?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had found it in the pocket of her work uniform when she had gotten off work.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, this man had known that the bracelet was with her. Then, he had even found out where she lived and silently barged in...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">To be able to do such a thing, who on earth was this man?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You picked up this bracelet, what reward do you want? As long it isn't too excessive, I can give it to you." Brian lowered his head and looked down at the woman in front of him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had planned to leave directly with the bracelet, but when he saw the woman's sleeping face, he had decided to remain in the house.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought, maybe, he wanted to see what this woman looked like when she opened her eyes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, she had really awoken. She had a pair of extremely beautiful almond eyes, the deep and dark pupils clearly contrasting with the sclera. The eyelashes that curled upwards added a bit of charm to this pair of eyes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was just that when this pair of eyes opened, the gaze that emerged was filled with a kind of lifeless apathy that didn't match her age.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was as if she had gone through too much hardship and had already lost the vibrance that she ought to have. Now, she was instead resigned to her fate.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace did not know who the man in front of her was. However, he seemed to have a similar temperament to Jason.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In her current situation, she could not afford to provoke such a person.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This bracelet just happened to be in the pocket of my work uniform. It can't be said that I picked it up, so you don't need to reward me," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian raised his eyebrows. He hadn't expected that a woman who lived in such a small house and did cleaning work would directly refuse the reward he offered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Even if I could give you a reward that could change your life, you wouldn't want it?" he said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace could not help but think of what Jason had said to her back then. These two people were indeed very similar. Both of them seemed to be able to easily change other people's lives.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, this was her life. She didn't want to be controlled by others. She just wanted to be the master of her own fate.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, thanks. This bracelet has been returned to its rightful owner and I didn't do anything to help," Grace replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian's face sank slightly and he tilted his body a little. His face drew close to hers, and his pair of pitch-black phoenix eyes seemed to be scrutinizing her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace subconsciously tightened her grip on the blanket covering her body and she glared at the man in front of her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She did not know who this man was or what he wanted to do. However, he had been able to enter the room silently at night easily. If he really wanted to do something to her, she might not be able to stop him at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two people looked at each other in silence. After a long while, the man's cold and indifferent voice finally sounded again. "Are you saying that to get more benefits? Are you playing hard to get?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was stunned for a moment and then said, "I don't have that ability, and I can't play hard to get with you. What's more, I don't even know who you are. Since you have obtained the bracelet, can you leave? I have to go to work early in the morning, and I want to sleep for another two hours."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He slowly straightened up, holding the small silver bracelet with his slender fingers. As his gaze fell on her face, he opened his thin lips and said lightly, "I'm Brian. Now, you should know who I am."</p></div>
