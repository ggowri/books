        <h1>Chapter 749</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, why was there a strong feeling in the way he looked at her as if it could not be melted?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It even gave her the illusion that he loved her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could he love me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He hates me! I slept with him and left the next day without a word!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." She bit her lip and for a moment did not know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not wait for her to answer. He took out his phone, dialed a number, and said to the other end of the line, "Get the news about Lily being blacklisted and forced to quit to the top of the trending searches list... Yes&hellip; Hold on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, Hadwin turned his head to Lina and asked, "How many days do you want it to be number one on the trending searches list?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Lina blinked, still a little distracted. She said subconsciously, "Three days?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Three days then," Hadwin replied to the other end of the line. A moment later, he put away the phone and said to Lina, "Alright. I've done what you wanted."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina blinked her eyes again. 'That's&hellip; It?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She worked hard for most of the day without success, yet&hellip; Uh, it was all done with a kiss and a phone call?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina suddenly thought that her kiss... Seemed to be worth a lot of money. However, she did not know how much money topping the trending searches list would cost Hadwin!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It could not be removed. Even if Lily used the Atkinson family and her own ability to pull some strings, the news about her being blacklisted and forced to quite stayed well on top of the trending searches list.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who did it? Who the hell did it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it Jason?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was there someone else?' After all, many people in the entertainment industry were jealous of her, so there were probably a lot of people who were planning to kick her while she was down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Still can't figure out who it is?" Lily barked at her manager on the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They&rsquo;re mysterious. We can't find out who it is. All I can find out is that your news has to top the trending searches list for three days before getting removed," said the manager.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Lily could not believe it. She could not even stand it for an hour, let alone three days!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whatever it costs, remove it from the trending searches list!" Lily said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Sean walked into the room, Lily threw herself into Sean's arms with a tearful face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sean, someone&rsquo;s trying to get at me. They made the news about me getting blacklisted to the top trending search. What should I do? I&hellip; I'll be the joke of the entire upper-class society!" Lily said pitifully. The pity on her face was enough to evoke anyone's desire to protect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean held Lily. "I won't let others laugh at you. I'll help you with the trending searches list incident."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all Grace's fault. If it hadn't been for her, how could I have ended up like this? However, she won't be happy for long. I'm waiting to see when Jason gets tired of her and dumps her," Lily said bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That probably... Won&rsquo;t happen," Sean said after a moment's hesitation. After all, anyone who had ever seen Jason with Grace could tell how much Jason loved Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily only smiled with a touch of menace on the corners of her lips. It formed a sharp contrast against the pity on her face.</p></div>
