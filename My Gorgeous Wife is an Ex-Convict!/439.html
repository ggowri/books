        <h1>Chapter 438</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they arrived at the VIP area, there was a person-in-charge waiting for them. All Grace needed to do was to follow the nurse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed the nurse to draw some blood, take an x-ray, and go for an ultrasound scan among others. Jason waited patiently for Grace at the VIP lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Grace followed the nurse through all the various departments, she saw a few that had a long queue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse explained to her that those were people from other organizations who were here for a check-up. Thus, it was rather crowded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace followed the nurse toward the ultrasound room, a few of the other rooms had a long queue, but the nurse led Grace to another door that had no queue outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Grace!&rdquo; Suddenly, a voice called out Grace&rsquo;s name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned around to see who it was. She saw Andrea in one of the queues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was taken aback. She had not expected to bump into Andrea here. &lsquo;Is she here for a check-up as well? That means...&rsquo; Grace took a look at Andrea&rsquo;s queue to see a few familiar faces from the law firm she used to work at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What a coincidence. Her ex-colleagues from that law firm were here for a check-up today as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea said something to the person next to her and left the queue as she dashed over to Grace. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d see you here. Are you here to deliver food?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m here for a check-up.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Check-up...&rdquo; Andrea took a look at Grace. Grace did not dress like she usually did when she delivered food. She looked much more youthful now. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. You haven&rsquo;t done a health check-up since you came out. You should do a proper check-up now.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Andrea pretended to be kind and sighed. &ldquo;The queue is rather long today. I was thinking of letting you jump into the queue with me. That way, you can save time. But if I do that, it&rsquo;ll be unfair to those behind me. I&rsquo;m truly sorry.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found it hilarious. If Andrea was truly apologetic, she would not have mentioned it at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to feel sorry for it. I don&rsquo;t plan on jumping queues either,&rdquo; Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse next to Grace suddenly said, &ldquo;Ms. Cummins, can we go to the ultrasound room first? The doctor is waiting for you inside.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Grace answered and followed the nurse to the nearby ultrasound room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea was dumbfounded. What just happened? Why did the nurse lead Grace into the ultrasound room? She had enquired earlier regarding why that room had no queue. The hospital staff informed her that the room was not for regular patients.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If that was the case, why was Grace entering that room now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea returned to her queue with a gloomy face. Her colleague who was in the queue asked her, &ldquo;Andrea, is that the senior who used to work in our firm but was sentenced to prison later? Is she here for a check-up as well? Why isn&rsquo;t she in the queue at the back? She went straight into that room!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Andrea pursed her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Andrea, is that senior now a food delivery person after she came out?&rdquo; That colleague curiously asked as she had heard such rumors in the law firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes. She has delivered food to our law firm a few times. Let me order food from her shop again on Monday. Consider it as me giving business to her workplace.&rdquo; Andrea smiled, but in her heart, she decided that she was going to embarrass Grace on that day.</p></div>
