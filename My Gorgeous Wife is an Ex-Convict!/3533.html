        <h1>Chapter 3531</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, William went to see Jason alone. "Uncle Reed, are you sure the person Jasper saw wasn't Lawrence?" he asked directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know," Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't know?" William was puzzled by the fact that this answer wasn't a definite yes or no.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The other party intentionally avoided surveillance, and we found out that the car they were driving was also a fake license plate car. In areas without surveillance, they disappeared without a trace, making it impossible for us to track them down," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William remained silent. If even the Reed family was difficult to investigate, then it was likely that they wouldn't be able to find any results.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about the information you gave to Jasper...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just didn't want her to keep thinking about this matter," Jason didn't hide anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, William understood that all of that information was probably fake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, did Jasper really see Lawrence or not?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I think Jasper didn't make a mistake," Jason said directly, as if he could see William's suspicion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William trembled and turned pale. "Is it Lawrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it's very likely. I had someone compare the screenshots from the court surveillance with Lawrence's old photos. Although the surveillance footage is blurry, the comparison results are real. The person has some facial features similar to Lawrence's. So, it's very likely him!" Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, it was precisely because that person was very likely Lawrence, but did not show up, and even had the ability to evade the Reed family's pursuit, that made Jason more worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I'm afraid that the Lawrence of today is not the same as the Lawrence of the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William lowered his head and remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Jason asked, "What are you going to do if that person is really Lawrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's hand, hanging by his side, tightened suddenly. If it really was Lawrence, then once he appeared in front of Jasper, Jasper...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The various possibilities had flashed through her mind more than once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William took a deep breath and looked up at Jason, saying, "I will find him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason raised an eyebrow and asked, "Aren't you worried that Jasper will be too concerned about Lawrence when he's found?" His words seemed to imply something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I am worried," William admitted, "but if we don't find Lawrence, Jasper will never be happy. So, I hope we can find Lawrence. As for whether Jasper will be too concerned about Lawrence after we find him, that's something we'll deal with later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William wouldn't let Lawrence easily occupy Jasper's heart. He would work hard to make Jasper understand what love is and fall in love with him. Over the years, he had been constantly striving to become better, just so that one day in the future, she could love him and he could be more worthy of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason looked at William and a hint of approval flashed in his eyes.</p></div>
