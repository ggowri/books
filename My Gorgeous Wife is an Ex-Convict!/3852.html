        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Face?" Mason swept Rosalind coldly, "Do you think the Reed family cares about face?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalind was speechless for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door of a bedroom in the room opened, and it was Archer and Rosalind's son Lionel who came out. When he saw Mason in the living room, Lionel immediately widened his eyes in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, why are you here?" Lionel asked anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason said coldly, "I'm not your brother. I'm just here to tell your parents that Veronica will cut ties with the Barlow family from now on. So, it's best for you, the Barlow family, to stay away from Veronica. As for any debts the Barlow family has, don't involve her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lionel's mind couldn't keep up for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer hurriedly retorted, "Our relationship is not something that can be easily broken. After all, Veronica is my daughter. If you are with Veronica, then I am your father-in-law. Do you really want to take my daughter away from me? People will laugh at us if you say that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Laugh at us?" Mason's eyes flickered. "I'd like to see who would dare to laugh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer's face turned red. Of course, no one in Emerald City would dare to openly mock Mason of the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, I came here today just to warn you, not to negotiate with you. If you don't listen to the warning, then you'll bear the consequences." After Mason finished speaking, he turned around and was about to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer quickly stood up and tried to stop him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before he could grab Mason's clothes, Mason kicked him and then stepped on his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh..." Archer's face turned from red to purple, feeling extremely uncomfortable. He desperately tried to move Mason's foot away, but it was as heavy as a thousand pounds and he couldn't budge it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalind and He Wanye were completely dumbfounded by this scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalind was the first to react, trembling as she said, "Mason, please...please release your foot. How could you step on your elder like this? After all, we are the ones who raised you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Raised me?" Mason sneered. "When did you raise me? At first, Secretary Wylie gave me money, and later, the Reed family gave me money. You just did what you were paid to do. And what's the result? You seem to have forgotten your place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalind was embarrassed and her face turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'd better recognize your own identity. Don't forget where you stand. The Reed family only has a relationship with you because of Veronica. If Veronica wasn't in the </span><span>Barlow family, you would be nothing." After Mason finished speaking, he lifted his foot and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer coughed repeatedly, and Rosalind and Lionel helped him up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three members of the Reed family looked at each other with ugly expressions on their faces.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the Barlow family, Mason went directly to Veronica's school to pick her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How come you're here? Didn't the doctor tell you to rest more?" Veronica asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was like a shining object, and most of the people passing by would gaze at him, even if he had a plain expression and dressed modestly, he would still attract attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came to pick you up. Didn't you say you only had classes in the morning today?" Mason said. "Are all your morning classes over now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're over, but she had some other things to do today," she replied.</span></p></div>
