        <h1>Chapter 1344</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace still had to comfort Jason after the injection. "Alright, I'm really okay. It's just an injection, and it doesn't hurt very much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes had turned a little red now. 'Doesn&rsquo;t hurt very much? How could that be?' He had asked the doctor and knew that the more times she got the injection, the more painful it would be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, be good. Didn't you tell me not to feel upset? Why do you look like you're about to cry now? We have a class to attend later," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She patted Jason's shoulder and rubbed his head as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse, who was still in the room, looked at the sight in shock. 'Is this... Master Reed? Emerald City's famous Master Reed who&rsquo;s said to be decisive and cold-blooded?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But why does he look... just like a puppy?! He looks like a puppy asking its owner for cuddles, kisses, and others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Of course... The owner is naturally...' The nurse stole a glance at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only this woman could do such a thing to Master Reed. Master Reed had married a nobody, and the news was only spread among the hospital staff. There was no news about it outside!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At first, many of the medical staff in the hospital were still talking about the possibility that the woman had forced Master Reed to marry her because she was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now it seemed that it was not the case at all. Master Reed seemed to care more about the woman than the three babies in her belly. It was as if he could not bear having the woman feel any pain, even if it was only an injection!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace and Jason arrived at the classroom, Grace realized something... 'Uh... It seems there are more and more people in this classroom!&rsquo; At least, there were more people than when she first attended the class.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace somehow felt that when she and Jason walked into the classroom that was a bit noisy before, it suddenly became quiet as many people turned to look at them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I imagining it?' she thought to herself and then turned to Jason, asking, "Jay, don't you think there are more people now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A little," Jason said lightly, holding Grace's hand and walking toward their usual seats. Although the room was more crowded, those two seats remained unoccupied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after the two got closer, everyone found that their eyes were red. It was as if... they had just cried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Cried?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd could not help but tremble. Well... Who could imagine Master Reed &lsquo;crying&rsquo;? If Master Reed cried... Emerald City would be in turmoil!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, those red eyes... really let one's imagination run wild!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was also looking at Jason's slightly red eyes. "Your eyes are still red. People would think that I bullied you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason muttered, "You're the only one who can bully me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I won't bully you." She inexplicably blushed.</p></div>
