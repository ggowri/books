        <h1>Chapter 2837</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla and Martin Weiss?" Brian followed Valda Theller's gaze and said, "Do you want to say hello?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "Yeah, but I'd better wait for the reporters to leave first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, the reporters seemed to have finished conducting interviews and walked away from Kyla and Martin Weiss. Then, Valda Theller and Brian walked over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla," Valda Theller said hello.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was slightly surprised after seeing Valda Theller. "Valda, you're here too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla greeted Brian again before saying to Valda Theller, "This is my husband, Martin Weiss." Then, she turned to Martin Weiss and said, "Martin, this is Mr. Hart's girlfriend, Valda Theller."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, Mr. Weiss." Valda Theller offered her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello." Martin Weiss politely shook her hand and sized up Brian and Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the four exchanged pleasantries, Valda Theller turned to Kyla and said, "Kyla, would you mind joining me over there for a minute? We haven't seen each other for a long time. I'd like to talk to you alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." Kyla smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at Brian again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go on. Mr. Weiss and I will look for you two later," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller and Kyla then headed toward the lounge on the other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at the two women&rsquo;s leaving figures and said suddenly to Brian, "I didn't think you'd have a girlfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian replied, "Why wouldn't I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, have you fallen out of love with Grace?" Martin Weiss asked. Speaking of which, the two of them were not that familiar with each other. They knew each other because of Grace's relationship with Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's face darkened slightly. "Since when did you like to speculate about other people's relationships?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just a little curious how someone who has loved deeply can love another person?" Martin Weiss muttered as if asking Brian as well as himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked down gently. "Many people in this world fall in love more than once. Don't you think it's ridiculous to say that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pondered for a moment before chuckling suddenly. "Yeah, it's ridiculous. Maybe few people only love once. Most people can love a second, third, and even a fourth time..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought you and Kyla were back together and doing well, but that doesn't seem to be the case," mused Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There&rsquo;ll always be a lot of things in this world that are out of your control," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like how he still fell for Kyla after being hypnotized. He could not let go of his feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe... everything was meant to be.</p></div>
