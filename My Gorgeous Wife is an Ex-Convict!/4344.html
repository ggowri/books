        <h1>Chapter 4342 Agreement</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">Brian and Valda were taken aback by what Harley had said. The couple glanced at each other, and finally, it was Brian who broke the silence. &quot;Did something unpleasant happen between you and Lornell at the banquet today?&quot; he asked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When Harley and Lornell came over to say hello earlier, he noticed that his daughter&#x27;s expression was a bit off, and her eyes weren&#x27;t following Lornell around like they usually did.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Nothing unpleasant happened,&quot; Harley said nonchalantly, &quot;I just came to understand a few things, that&#x27;s all!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;What have you figured out?&quot; Valda asked.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I understand that to Lornell, I&#x27;m just the most suitable marriage partner, but not the one he loves,&quot; Harley confessed. She thought such a reality would cause her great pain, but perhaps she&#x27;s been hurting for so long that she&#x27;s now numb.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Harley looked up at her parents, &quot;Mom, Dad, I know that my decision might cause trouble for our family. If we really break off the engagement, it could cost us a lot. People might even say that we&#x27;re ungrateful. But ever since I was a kid, I&#x27;ve admired your love for each other. I&#x27;ve always hoped that one day, I could have a love like that too. But...&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">She paused for a moment, took a deep breath, and said, &quot;I know, there will never be such a love between me and Lornell. So, I want to break off our engagement!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Valda&#x27;s eyes welled up with tears. She had always been a witness to Harley&#x27;s feelings for Lornell.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She&#x27;s always understood that when it comes to love, it&#x27;s always been her daughter who&#x27;s been the one giving everything.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Once, she had hoped that her daughter could break off the engagement with the Quentin family. Even if it meant the Hart family had to pay a price for it, it didn&#x27;t matter. All she wanted was her daughter&#x27;s happiness!</p><p style="text-align:left;">But Harley refused to give up. She would rather strive to maintain this engagement, even if it meant continuing to give unilaterally.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She still remembered her daughter once telling her, &quot;Mom, I really like Lornell. I believe that as long as I keep liking him and treating him well, he will eventually start to like me too! Even if he doesn&#x27;t like me as much as I like him, it&#x27;s okay. I will gradually make him like me more!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Back then, when Harley was speaking those words, her face was full of girlish dreams.</p><p style="text-align:left;">And now, after hearing what Harley had to say, she could almost picture the heartbreak and disappointment she must have gone through to decide to call off the engagement.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Valda&#x27;s heart ached for her daughter.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brian looked at his daughter, &quot;Are you sure about this? Do you really want to break off the engagement? Once we propose to the Quentin family to end the engagement, there might be no turning back.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I&#x27;ve made up my mind,&quot; Harley said seriously, &quot;I don&#x27;t want my marriage to be just &#x27;suitable&#x27; in this lifetime!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alright then! Your mother and I will get things ready. In a few days, we&#x27;ll propose to the Quentin family to call off the engagement!&quot; said Brian.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brian didn&#x27;t care what it cost, all he cared about was whether his daughter was happy!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Dad, thank you!&quot; Harley said, &quot;And... I&#x27;m sorry.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You don&#x27;t need to say sorry!&quot; Brian lifted his hand, gently stroking his daughter&#x27;s head, &quot;This is what we should do as your parents. All you need to do is figure out what you want and what you don&#x27;t.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Tears welled up in Harley&#x27;s eyes. Her parents were the best parents anyone could ask for. Having them as her parents was the greatest fortune she could ever have!</p></div>
