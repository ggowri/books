        <h1>Chapter 110</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jay..." Her mumbling voice sounded from her mouth, and it was as if a ten-thousand-pound weight was smashing into his heart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His body froze all of a sudden as if all his senses had been enveloped by her voice.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She raised her chin, and on her delicate face was a smile. Her soft lips came close to his and she kissed him deeply.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was in a daze as he took in her kiss.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He could've easily dodged this kiss. He knew that she was only doing it because she was under the effects of the drug.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But... he couldn't bear to do such a thing.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't make himself refuse this kiss. When she kissed him, he felt like he was falling under a spell.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She then continued to deepen the kiss. When the tip of her tongue pried open his teeth, his body suddenly stiffened.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, after that, he opened his mouth and allowed her to do as she wished.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was probably the only person who he would allow to do this to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The blood in his body seemed to be boiling. He had always been a cold person. Even if a woman came close to him, she wouldn't be able to move him whatsoever. But she was different.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her kiss, her breath, and every touch from her fingers entranced him further and further.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, she said in a hoarse voice, "Jay, it's so uncomfortable... so uncomfortable..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only then did he suddenly come back to his senses. Just now, he had almost taken her directly! When he looked at her, his dark eyes were full of desire, but he was forcibly suppressing it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if he really did want her, it wasn't appropriate in a situation like this.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After taking a deep breath, he pressed the nurse's call button.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a while, the doctor and nurse rushed over and gave Grace a sedative, and only then did she quieten down.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Others might not have discovered anything, but Terrence had been by Jason's side for so many years. He could more or less sense that his own boss was acting strangely at the moment. It was as if he was suppressing something.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Could it be..." Terrence looked at Grace on the bed and suddenly had an inkling as to what was going on.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sometimes, how much a man cared about a woman was not measured directly by how much he wanted her, but rather by how much he could restrain himself when he wanted her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Who would have thought that a man like Mr. Reed would forcefully hold back his own desire for the sake of a woman?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed's care for her is probably carved into his bones at this point!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That was all Terrence was thinking when he left the room.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the evening of Thanksgiving, the Stevens and Atkinson families had their celebratory dinner together. After that, Lily went to the back garden of the Stevens family's house with Sean.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is there anything between you and Jason?" Lily suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean's body stiffened all of a sudden. He looked at Lily with a pale face. "What are you talking about? What could there be between us?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If not, then why did your expression look so bad after talking to Jason at our engagement party? Also, are the matters of Zoe being injured and the Stevens family failing to gain approval for a loan from the bank connected to one another?"</p></div>
