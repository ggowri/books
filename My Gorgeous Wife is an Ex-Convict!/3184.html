        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly hugged her and buried his face in her neck, saying "I don't want to let go, but I have to wait until tomorrow to see you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just a matter of ten or so hours." She said, even though she's not currently living with him at night, they usually meet during the day and have lunch or dinner together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isn't it soon?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was somewhat amused and bemused, "Are you really Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What, do you think I'm not?" he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I feel like you're a little different from the person I used to know," she said. When she first met him, she thought he was very aloof and hard to approach, but now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's different?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not as cold as before, and you don't talk as little as before. Now, sometimes you can be a bit clingy..." She paused, feeling embarrassed to continue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He finished her sentence, "Clingy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...yeah, something like that," she coughed slightly, feeling awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you like me this way?" he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face turned slightly red. Did she like it? If she did, then this different version of him was something only she could see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I like it," she confessed softly, blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled slightly and looked at her, "Valda, I'll only cling to you." His transformation was because of her, because he was falling more and more in love with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He loved her so much that he wanted to spend more time with her every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian hugged Valda for a while longer before reluctantly driving away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda returned to the apartment and saw Lisa waiting for her in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Godmother, what's wrong? Is there something you need?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lisa handed Valda a slightly crumpled passbook and said, "The money in here is what I've saved up over the years. It was originally meant to be my retirement fund, but now that you're getting married and your godmother doesn't have anything valuable to give you, consider this as your dowry. If you need to buy anything for your wedding, feel free to use this money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda said, "Auntie, this is your retirement money. How can I use it? You should keep it for yourself. I have enough money for my wedding, and besides, Brian and the Hart family won't care if I have a dowry or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Although that's what you said, since you called me 'godmother', I should give you this dowry. You treat me like a mother, and I treat you like a daughter. This is just a small gesture from me as your godmother," Lisa said. If her own daughter were still alive, she would have been married by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Previously, every time she watched the scene of the daughters getting married in the village, she secretly envied them. But now, she can finally contribute her efforts for the daughter she has adopted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, you must keep this, because you are my daughter," said Lisa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's eyes turned red, feeling as if the crumpled passbook in her hand weighed a ton.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, Lisa fell asleep and Valda looked at the numbers on her bank book. The amount was not significant, not even equal to her annual income. However, she knew that it would take Lisa a lot of time to earn this money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is Lisa's retirement money, but she gave it all to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda carefully put away her bank book. Now, she feels very happy because Lisa takes care of her, Brian loves her, and the Hart family spoils her.</p></div>
