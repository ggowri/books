        <h1>Chapter 2090</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla sat at the side, thinking of what to do next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss knew she was pregnant now. Then, in the future...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, a whisper rang in Kyla's ear. "Hey, is this man your husband? Your husband seems so concerned about you. Mine never cared about my morning sickness. You're lucky."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Lucky? 'Kyla smiled bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This woman would not call her lucky if she knew what she had been through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Kyla and Martin Weiss left the hospital, Martin Weiss said, "I think we need to find a place to talk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She hesitated a little but did not refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, they did need to talk through this situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let's find a place close by. I don't want to walk very far," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss found a private room in a restaurant near the hospital and ordered some desserts. "Your stomach is empty after throwing up so much. Eat something. The doctor said you can eat something light if you have severe morning sickness early in the pregnancy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla did not touch her chopsticks but looked at Martin Weiss and said, "You don't need to do these for me. I'll handle my pregnancy myself and won't bother you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss instantly turned ghastly pale. "What do you mean you'll handle it yourself? What do you mean you won't bother me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla took a deep breath. "Everything will go on as usual. Just like what we said before. It was an accident. Let's pretend nothing happened!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly sneered. "So are you going to pretend that the baby in your belly doesn&rsquo;t exist?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll take care of the baby myself," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her body shivered when she met his eyes. "How I take care of the baby is my business. It has nothing to do with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, how can you say I have nothing to do with this baby? They're our baby. How could they have nothing to do with me?" said Martin Weiss as his deep eyes were full of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked away. Martin Weiss's eyes made her feel indescribable guilt and panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What am I guilty of? What am I panicking about?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was clear that Martin Weiss was responsible for everything that happened from the very beginning, while she was the one who suffered!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss got up, walked around the table, went to Kyla, and knelt. "Kyla, give me a chance to take good care of you and our children, okay? I did nothing when you were pregnant with Nelson, causing you to suffer. Will you let me do what I should do this time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked down at Martin Weiss in front of her as a complex emotion welled up within her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I screamed your name over and over again in prison and wanted to die many times. It was the baby I was carrying that yanked me back from the brink of death and helped me survive..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She mumbled about everything that had happened, and he unconsciously trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Everything she said was stabbing his heart like the sharpest swords, telling him what pain was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Unfortunately, this pain had no cure. As time went on, it became the pain of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did too many bad things in the past that he could not make up for it even now.</p></div>
