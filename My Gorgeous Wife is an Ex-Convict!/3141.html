        <h1>Chapter 3139</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's gaze darkened as he looked at Valda, who was unusually silent. His lips almost formed a straight line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Valda and Brian entered the apartment, Valda turned on the lights and was about to go back to the bedroom to change out of her dress. Suddenly, Brian grabbed her wrist and said, "Valda..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" Valda turned her head and looked at Brian. "Can you loosen your grip first? I...I want to go change my clothes. If you have something to say, wait until I change my clothes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So... shall I help you change it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, no!" Her face suddenly turned red, and she avoided his gaze. "I can change by myself..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She spoke while twisting her wrist again, trying to pull her hand out of his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he actually tightened his grip instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, let go!" she whispered softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Let go?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why would he dare to let go? He's afraid that if he does, she'll just run away again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian suddenly pulled Valda into his arms and said, "Valda, please don't change your mind!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Regret?" Valda was confused and didn't understand what he meant by this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian buried his head in Valda's shoulder and held her tighter. "Don't regret what happened today. Don't refuse to marry me. I know... I can't guarantee that similar things won't happen in the future, but Valda, I will do everything I can to protect you. No matter how much ridicule or pain we face in the future, I will stand in front of you. So, don't regret it, don't give up on me, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was stunned. She never expected that Brian's "don't regret it" meant this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was afraid that she would regret it and cancel their marriage agreement, wasn't he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His embrace was so tight, but it carried a tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was... his fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a wave of guilt surged in Valda's heart. It was her who made him afraid. He was such a brave person, but he was afraid because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hands slowly hugged his waist. "Brian, I won't regret it. I've said it before. I want to marry you, I want to be Mrs. Hart, I want to have children with you, and I will always be with you. So how could I give up on you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body trembled, then he looked up at her. "Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, really." She nodded and said, "Before I went there today, I was mentally prepared, so I wasn't greatly affected. Of course, it was a bit embarrassing, but I will digest it myself and won't dwell on it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why did you pull your hand away when I kissed the back of it earlier, and why didn't you talk much on the way here?" he asked. It was because of this that he became even more anxious, afraid that she might give up on him just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because..." She bit her lip slightly and blushed for a while before saying, "Because I felt a little embarrassed. When you kissed the back of my hand, I felt like my body got warmer, and then... I pulled my hand back. In the car... you didn't say anything, and I also felt a little embarrassed to speak up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was stunned, "I'm sorry?" Her answer completely caught him off guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhm." She nodded and said, "So... it's really not what you think."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He breathed a sigh of relief at this moment, "It's good that it's not the case. But from now on, you can't have any thoughts of wanting to divorce or give up on me, okay?"</p></div>
