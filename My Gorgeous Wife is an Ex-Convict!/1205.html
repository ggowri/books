        <h1>Chapter 1204</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she came to the hospital and mentioned Lina's name at the nurses&rsquo; station, what was originally a fluke finally came true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was heavily injured and just got out of the emergency room. She was still under observation in the ICU ward. She could only be transferred to the general ward once she got through the critical period. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything in front of Grace seemed to be turning gray. When she came to the ICU ward, she saw Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney standing by the glass wall. They were crying as they looked inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not having seen Lina's parents for more than four years, Grace never thought she would see them again in a place like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Lina... Lina is now...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's legs were trembling. She was afraid to go up and see what Lina looked like behind the glass wall. She was scared that she would not be able to bear the sight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Step... by step...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The short distance became so far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she finally walked up to the transparent glass wall, Grace caught sight of Lina lying on the hospital bed through the glass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In an instant, Grace burst into tears!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is that Lina? Is it Lina?' The person in the hospital bed had tubes stuck in her nose and thick gauze wrapped around her head as she lay motionless. If it were not for the changing numbers on the machines next to her, people would even think... she was dead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is going on?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina had been so energetic when she talked to her on the phone before leaving Emerald City. Lina also said that they would meet up, go shopping, and have a meal together when she got back. Why did this happen?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why was Hadwin Stephenson missing? Why was Lina so seriously injured? These incidents were like puzzles, and there was no answer to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's going on... with Lina?" murmured Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice caught the attention of Lina's parents. When they looked around and saw Grace, their anger flared up as if they had finally found an outlet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Sweeney angrily said to Grace, "What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you on the phone that if you remember how good Lina was to you that you should stop harassing us? Lina has given up so much for you. Now that this has happened to her, can't you just leave our family alone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I just want to know what happened to Lina and if there's anything I can do to help," Grace sobbed while speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Sweeney snapped. "Help? What can you do to help? You're an ex-convict. You're neither a doctor nor a police officer. What can you do? Treat Lina? Or help Lina find the culprit?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace clenched her teeth. She could not contradict Mrs. Sweeney's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, all she could do was look at the injured Lina but do nothing to help!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney was calmer than Mrs. Sweeney. He grabbed his wife and said, "Alright, stop talking about it. What's the use of telling her?"</p></div>
