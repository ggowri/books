        <h1>Chapter 3879</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I don't want to forgive you," Veronica said to Cato. "I don't think there was any misunderstanding that day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're all classmates, why say that?" Cato's girlfriend said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If we were really just classmates, then we wouldn't have poured soup on each other in public. Did you not think about the danger before doing it?" Veronica said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not like it was that dangerous. The soup wasn't even hot, and besides, you weren't burned," the other person defended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica found it funny that some people always downplayed their own mistakes and thought they hadn't done anything wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But these past few days, she still felt scared when she thought about that bowl of soup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, the soup wasn't hot. If it had been scalding, it wouldn't have just been a matter of her getting burned, but it could have also caused her to lose the baby in her stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To her, the other person's behavior wasn't just insulting, but it was clearly hurtful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So she had no intention of forgiving him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whether or not I got burned is one thing, but whether or not he threw the soup is another," Veronica said. "Besides, it's my right to forgive or not, isn't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cato's girlfriend wasn't a good-tempered person to begin with, and she was used to being domineering in class. When she heard Veronica say this, she immediately retorted, "You're just acting like you're better than everyone else because you're Mason's girlfriend. You think you're superior and can pressure others at will?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems like you're the ones pressuring me now," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can you say that? You deliberately pressured the Reed family to pressure Cato's family. Are you so malicious that you want to make them unlucky just because of a small bowl of soup?" the girl said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mira!" Cato quickly shouted to silence his girlfriend. After all, if things continued like this, it might turn into a conflict.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Student Barlow, it's my business to throw soup on you, and it has nothing to do with my family. But now, because of the Reed family's obstruction, the project that we could have taken over has been discouraged and suspended. I hope you can make the Reed family stop," Cato said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His girlfriend muttered, "That's a multi-billion dollar project. It's too much for just a bowl of soup!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica finally understood that the reason was more complicated than she had originally thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From what she heard, Cato's family should be well-off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it was precisely because of this that he would throw soup without any concern for the consequences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe for Cato, even if she was really burned by the soup, it would only be a matter of paying some money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sometimes, a bowl of soup can have such consequences. A small accident can cause irreparable consequences. Since your family is in business, you should understand this principle," Veronica said to Cato. "Don't make this mistake again in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cato squinted his eyes and said, "What did you say--"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as he raised his hand, suddenly two people who had been hiding in the dark rushed out and subdued Cato to the ground.</p></div>
