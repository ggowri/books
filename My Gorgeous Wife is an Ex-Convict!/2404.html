        <h1>Chapter 2402</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I hope to talk to you more.&rdquo; Grace smiled at Whitney Herrera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, we'll make an appointment some time." With that, Whitney Herrera bade them goodbye and left in a car while holding her husband's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace watched the car drive away and said to Brian, "Thank you. You did me another favor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I&rsquo;ll always help you if I can," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's... the point..." Grace said with a sigh. She only felt indescribably stressed when he behaved like this. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe... it's meant to be." He gave a bitter smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gazed at the person in front of her. "Brian, if things are meant to be, the one meant for you must still be waiting for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Someone's... waiting for me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian watched Grace get into the car, and the car slowly left his sight. She kept moving while he remained in the same spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had remained in that forest on the hill when he first met her as a child&hellip; He had never moved on, while she had moved on and fallen in love with the one meant for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was left alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could he possibly have someone who was meant for him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace returned to the hotel. Kyla had already fallen asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the sleeping Kyla and asked Martin Weiss, "How is Kyla doing these days?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She doesn&rsquo;t sleep well and will sometimes wake up in the middle of the night from nightmares," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because of Amber Mitchell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She&rsquo;s worried that Amber Mitchell will continue to be tortured," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How Amber Mitchell was admitted to the mental hospital and what had happened between Amber Mitchell, Herman Moss, and George Gregory are indeed suspicious. Amber Mitchell was admitted to the mental hospital after Herman Moss died in a car accident. We need to investigate if these incidents are related," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But it&rsquo;ll take a long time to get to the bottom of this, and we may even find nothing in the end," said Martin Weiss. After all, it was so long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, everything happened a long time ago. Besides, Kyla may give birth at any time after 28 weeks of pregnancy. It isn't suitable for us to stay long in Deer City. Why don't you take Kyla back to Emerald City while I stay in Deer City?" Grace said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "She'll refuse. She won't leave Deer City until she has to. Even if I take her back to Emerald City, she'll probably try her best to come back here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was speechless. She could only take things one step at a time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace was ready to go back to her room, she saw Martin Weiss bending over suddenly and tucking Kyla in as though he was afraid she would catch a cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace abruptly asked, "Martin Weiss, have you truly forgotten your feelings for Kyla?"</p></div>
