        <h1>Chapter 1393</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if the person before him was his father, he could not accuse his mother wrongly either!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's expression sank. "Nelson, get out of the way. Your mommy did something wrong and must apologize!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one said, "I won't. Why should Mommy apologize if she didn't do anything wrong? Mommy's hand only touched the woman gently but she fell down herself. Mommy just didn't want her to touch me! Mommy didn't do anything wrong!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He disliked that woman as well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the woman had smiled at him, the way she looked at him contained a trace of hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the little one was still a child, he could sense who was kind to him and who hated him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Nelson&rsquo;s words now were like adding fuel to the fire for Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla Corbyn, is this how you&rsquo;ve been teaching the child? Full of lies! Do you want him to be full of lies like you? In case you didn't know, there was a surveillance camera in the private room!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Paisley just wanted to have a word with Nelson but you pushed her away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You only pushed her a little, but it was malicious! You knew Paisley was pregnant and you did it because you were afraid that if she gave birth to a child, they would threaten Nelson's status!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said cruelly. Every word was so cold and sharp!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn finally understood that some people could kill with words!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not care about Martin Weiss's misunderstanding toward her or any nasty words Martin Weiss was saying to her, but she did not want Martin Weiss to say these in front of Nelson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment, Martin Weiss was only talking about Paisley Daniels's so-called miscarried baby but he never thought about the possible impact on Nelson if he heard all this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She consciously moved her hands to remove the hearing aid from her son's ear, but Martin Weiss had already spoken the next words...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is this what you had in mind by giving me Nelson's custody? Are you counting on Nelson to inherit the Weiss family so you can enjoy the benefits in the future?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't! Don't go on!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn shouted in her heart and accelerated the movement of her hands. However, Nelson seemed to sense it. His little hand firmly covered the hearing aid, refusing to let Kyla Corbyn take it away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla Corbyn, I'm telling you. Even if Paisley can never give birth, I won't give the Weiss family to your son as you wish! The son you gave birth to doesn't deserve anything from the Weiss family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Martin Weiss only felt that he had been fooled by Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only thought that everything was just a conspiracy when he recalled how she had been willing to hand over the custody. It was just to let the child grow closer to him so he would hand over the Weiss family to Nelson and she could change her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he was looking at Kyla Corbyn with indignant hatred and pain that even he could not describe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Kyla Corbyn looked like she had been struck by lightning. She stared at Martin Weiss as she trembled all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How can he say such things in front of Nelson?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He shouldn't have said that if he had any trace of fatherly affection for him! Even if he's dissatisfied with me, he should yell at me when Nelson isn't around!'</p></div>
