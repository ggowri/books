        <h1>Chapter 2689</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The simple words made Valda Theller's heart melt. It felt good to have someone so protective of her, even though she knew she was only his girlfriend in name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you." Her voice choked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you thanking me? Didn't I say you're my girlfriend?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath, looked him straight in the eye, and said sternly, "But do you really want me as your girlfriend? I... I didn't know who you were earlier, but I now know you're the crown prince of the entertainment industry. Won't someone like me being your girlfriend only raise questions? It might ruin things for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Who I choose as my girlfriend is my business. Why bother with others' doubts? You only have to look like you love me in front of people. Of course, you can tell me now if you have something else in mind such as falling in love with someone else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hurriedly shook her head, "No, I'm not in love with someone else!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Including Raymond Bowman? I know you used to date him when you were in university."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller bit her lip slightly. It was not a secret during university, and it was not surprising that Brian knew about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah." She nodded. "Since you know I used to date him, you should know that the bullying I suffered in university was also because of him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She never told anyone else about the events of that year except Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not help confessing in front of Brian. "I did like him back then. I thought I was lucky to be able to be with the person I liked when I thought it was just a secret crush. But I found out he was in love with another woman, and I was only a tool for him to please her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she told Camille these, she felt nothing but bone-crushing pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the pain seemed to have disappeared when she told Brian this. All that remained were ridicule and... relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She found it ridiculous that she had once fallen in love with a person like Raymond Bowman. She even bet that Raymond Bowman had some feelings for her and that he would not defame her in front of everyone or send her to hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed inevitable that she lost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, she was glad that she had finally gotten over Raymond Bowman, who was just a passerby in her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, I don't like him. Not now, not ever again," Valda Theller said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? But I think he cares a lot about you," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If he cared about me, Assistant Maggie wouldn't have been the one to rush in front of the camera with the others to save me today. He was there watching," Valda Theller said with a slight smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so nonchalant as if Raymond Bowman did not mean anything to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at the woman in front of him. Sometimes, she was indecisive, but other times, she seemed so decisive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like how she agreed to date him and let go of her feelings for Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I envy you." A whisper escaped his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Envy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can withdraw your feelings," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment's hesitation, she said, "Maybe it's just like what you said. I can withdraw them because I didn't love him deep enough. Fortunately, my affection for Raymond Bowman wasn't deep enough."</p></div>
