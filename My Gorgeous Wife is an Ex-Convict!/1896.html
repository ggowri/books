        <h1>Chapter 1894</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace took a deep breath, bent her knees slightly, and was about to kneel. However, he sprinted toward her just as her knees were about to touch the ground. He grabbed her arm with one hand and lifted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, how dare you..." His lips quivered as he glared at her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'How dare she force me like that? How can she just kneel like this?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, you can't bear not to forgive me, right?" Grace hugged Jason tightly with her other hand. She knew that she was a little despicable by using such a way to keep him and make him forgive her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she did not want to lose him and not see him again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason stiffened, unable to refute her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Yes, I can't bear it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As if she had seen through him, she knew he could not bear to not forgive her and held on to this chance!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Was this a weakness? She was indeed his weakness. He could not even try to be indifferent to her after she hurt him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason looked down at Grace, who was in front of him. "Really? Do you really want me to forgive you that badly? Okay, then..." he said as he dragged her toward the main house by her arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace almost staggered after him. Moments later, he threw her hard onto a warm bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace sat up in bed in a fluster, only to see Jason standing by the bed. He was looking at her condescendingly, saying, "Take off your clothes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was stunned and did not respond for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't you want me to forgive you? Then show me how far you can go and how much you love me!" Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's face instantly turned red as she understood what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She bit her lip slightly and asked hesitantly, "Well... Do you really want me to use such a way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can just leave if you feel humiliated," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's hands clenched slightly into fists again as if she was giving herself courage. Then, she lifted her hand, and her slender fingers began unbuttoning her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Coat, sweater, cotton T-shirt... She took off her clothes one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stared at her, watching her every movement. He knew how difficult it was for her to do something like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had never been someone open. Even though they had three children together, she was still shy about such things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though there were times when she wanted him, she could not hide her shyness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His actions would have been an insult to any woman, but she was willing to do it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As she looked up at him with those dark almond-shaped eyes, he felt flustered more than ever. Her eyes seemed misty, her cheeks were red, and she was biting her lip slightly. It was like some sort of silent charm!</p></div>
