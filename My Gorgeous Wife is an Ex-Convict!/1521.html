        <h1>Chapter 1519</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This&hellip; This woman was in a relationship with Mr. Reed! It was mentioned online all over the news. Not only had this woman recently opened a chain of beauty salons but she was also close with a group of noblewomen in tMason Swansonty. Nothing could ever happen to someone like her in his restaurant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Otherwise, they would have to close the restaurant within a few days!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The manager rushed forward and said, "Miss Lynch, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch said angrily, "How could you let such a person into the restaurant? If something happens to my daughter in your restaurant, let's see how Mr. Reed will take care of you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The manager kept apologizing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, Jasper raised her eyes to look at her mother and godmother. She said cutely, "Mommy, you and Godmother fought. You said not to fight with anyone else, Mommy, didn&rsquo;t you?" She thought that Mommy would scold her because she had fought, but then Mommy and Godmother threw themselves into the battlefield after her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Did that mean that Mommy would not reprimand her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stroked her daughter's little head. "So you still remember Mommy saying that, huh&hellip; I said that we shouldn&rsquo;t fight unprovoked, but I didn&rsquo;t say we can&rsquo;t fight. If it&rsquo;s after you&rsquo;re bullied and abused, then do it! We call this... justified defense."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oh!" The little girl nodded her head, but it was unknown how much of it she understood. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Justified defense?" Irene Lynch was furious. At this moment, there were still many people around. She was totally humiliated! Now, she was desperate to regain some of her dignity. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that whatever happened today will be resolved so easily. I&rsquo;ll hire a lawyer to sue you until you lose all your money!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch, who was standing next to Irene Lynch, raised her chin and proudly rushed over Jasper Reed. "My mommy is going to find a lawyer uncle, and the lawyer uncle will punish you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jasper was even more arrogant than Oriel Lynch, almost raising her chin to the sky. "Your mommy needs the help of a lawyer uncle but my mommy is a lawyer herself, so she's not afraid!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"My mommy has a lot of money and can find a lot of great lawyer uncles!" Oriel Lynch said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"My mommy doesn't even need to spend money to have all the great lawyer uncles come!" Jasper proudly retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two children attacked each other with their childish voices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at Irene Lynch coldly. &ldquo;Fine, call the police! Leave a statement so that we have everything ready for when you prosecute me!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The restaurant manager hurriedly said to Grace, "Do you know who she is? Her daughter is the little young lady of the Reed family. You'd better hurry up and apologize to Miss Lynch now, or you won&rsquo;t be able to live in Emerald City peacefully in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I won&rsquo;t do that. If she really wants to sue me, then so be it.." Grace said. She was not surprised at how the manager was asking her to apologize without knowing what had happened. Many people in this world tended to gravitate toward profits and avoid harm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch wanted so badly to tear this woman in front of her into shreds. Call the police, she said? Great! When that time came, she would have this woman understand how unfortunate it was that she had offended her in Emerald City!</p></div>
