        <h1>Chapter 2087</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla returned to the store with a lot on her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn asked, "What was it? What did the doctor say about your vomiting?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"They just asked me to... eat blander food," said Kyla. After a pause, she said, "Mom, what will you say if I have another child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was now 35 years old. Although she was considered an older mother, many people could still give birth after 35 with the help of modern medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn froze, then said with a laugh, "Oh, you. Have you finally come around after I've been nagging you all these years? You're still young. You can find the right person, start a new family, and have another baby. Your relationship will grow stronger too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla immediately knew that her mother had misunderstood when she heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Mrs. Corbyn continued saying, "Are you interested in Chase? I think Chase is a nice man. Juliet and Nelson hit it off too. I approve it if you&rsquo;re thinking of starting a new family with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, no. What are you thinking? I'm not starting a new family with anyone. I just... suddenly wondered if I could have more children."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How can you get more children if you don't start a new family? Don't tell me you're adopting," said Mrs. Corbyn. After all, her daughter was not well of. She could not afford to adopt another child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla shook her head with a bitter smile. "No, it's not what you think." With that said, she went to work on other things without waiting for her mother to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A day later, Kyla went to the hospital for a blood test again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even she could not explain why she did it. She could just abort the baby if she did not want them. There was no need to take a pregnancy test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps... she had tacitly agreed to keep the baby?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was deep in a trance in the hospital's blood drawing hall. She did not notice Martin Weiss standing at the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss did not expect to run into Kyla here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He came to the hospital today to see the hospital's liver transplant specialist. He was still a little worried about Kyla's occasional pain in her liver, so he made an appointment to consult the specialist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he did not expect to meet her in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is she... ill?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss wanted to walk up to her but suddenly stopped after taking two steps forward!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His mind flashed back to what she had said to him that day in the hotel room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What had happened between them that night was just a nightmare for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Everything he longed for was not what she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her angry, tearful accusation was an excruciating punishment to him. Perhaps he should just keep his distance from her, just like how he had silently hidden in the dark and left her alone before this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss turned sideways, found a spot in the corner, and quietly looked at Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla finished drawing her blood and sat in a chair to wait for the blood test report. Half an hour passed by quickly. Kyla read the blood test report after she got it. There was a bitter smile on her face as she headed to the outpatient department.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla never realized Martin Weiss was here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes were full of confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What's on her blood test? Why did she show such a bitter smile after reading the blood test? Is there... something wrong with her health?'</p></div>
