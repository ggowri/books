        <h1>Chapter 3612</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She... cried!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was dazed, even though he had woken up and knew it was just a dream, the panic and pain he felt in the dream seemed as if Grace was real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It left her with a lingering feeling of fear even after waking up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was even grateful that it was just a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she returned to school, the first thing she did was call William, "Where are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm out doing something, I'll be back at school soon," William replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll wait for you at school!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up? Is there something wrong?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing much, I just wanted to see you," she said. Maybe it was the nightmare from </span><span>yesterday that made her want to see him urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't sure what this feeling was exactly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the weekend and there were no classes at school. Jasper couldn't stay in the dormitory, so he decided to go to the school gate first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that since he said he would be back at school soon, she could see him earlier if she waited at the gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Jasper arrived at the school gate, he was surprised to see two elderly people standing not far from the gate, seemingly in a hurry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two elderly people seemed familiar to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper squinted and looked at the two elderly people, trying to remember where she had seen them before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the two elderly people also saw her. The old lady seemed hesitant, but the old man, holding a bag of fruit in his hand, walked up to Jasper and said, "Excuse me, young lady. Are you a student at Stanford University? Could you please help us deliver these fruits to your school's William?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the other party mentioned William's name, Jasper was startled and suddenly remembered why he felt familiar with these two elderly people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These two elderly people were the scavengers she had seen in Deer Capital, but at this moment, they didn't look as dirty as they did in Deer Capital. They appeared quite tidy, so she didn't recognize them right away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you here to give fruit to William?" she asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes... yes, we are," the other party replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have seen you in Deer Capital. How did you end up in Emerald City? And how do you know that he is a student at Stanford University?" Jasper asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she didn't think William would disclose personal information like being a student at Stanford University to two unfamiliar scavengers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We are..." the old man wanted to speak, but the old lady interrupted, saying, "Why are you asking so many questions? We just want you to help deliver the fruit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really just want to deliver fruit to William, I will certainly pass it on. But I want to understand the reason why you came to Emerald City to deliver fruit," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During this period, William was already in a precarious situation, which made it necessary for her to be extra cautious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that her words had angered the old lady, who retorted, "Why can't we simply deliver fruit? Just because you are Jason's daughter, you think you can..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper squinted her eyes suddenly. She originally thought that the two old people asked her to deliver fruits because they recognized her from the time they met at the hospital, when she and William were together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the fact that they even knew she was someone's daughter indicated that things were not simple at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her identity at Stanford University was not a secret, and even in Emerald City, many people knew about it, these two people were just scavengers from Deer Capital. It was strange that they knew, to begin with!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you two?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Forget it, let's go," the old man said to the old lady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them grabbed the fruits and prepared to leave.</span></p></div>
