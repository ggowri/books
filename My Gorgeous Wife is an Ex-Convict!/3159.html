        <h1>Chapter 3157</h1>
        <div><p>Kyla instinctively avoided Martin&#x27;s gaze and smiled at Amber, &quot;I&#x27;ll have a drink with you.&quot;</p><p>On the other side, Brian patted Martin&#x27;s shoulder and said, &quot;Do you know what your expression just now looked like?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot; said Martin.</p><p>&quot;Students who are filling out their college applications are unsure of what the best choices are,&quot; said Brian. &quot;Did something happen between you and Kyla?&quot;</p><p>&quot;There was nothing, absolutely nothing happened, it was very calm,&quot; said Martin.</p><p>Because of this calmness, it makes him even more anxious. Sometimes, the more peaceful things are, the more it can make a person feel uneasy.</p><p>&quot;So why are you still showing such a conflicted expression? Are you not getting along well now?&quot; Brian asked.</p><p>&quot;No, we get along very well,&quot; Martin replied calmly and warmly. His relationship with Nelson was also improving, and sometimes he felt that this was the life he wanted.</p><p>However...deep down inside, Kyla has a growing sense of unease.</p><p>It&#x27;s because of the unresolved emotions from the past.</p><p>The hypnotized emotions are still there.</p><p>Although the hypnosis has not been lifted yet, he can&#x27;t help but think that if one day the hypnosis is accidentally lifted, the emotions that were accumulated before will be restored.</p><p>Once, he refused to break the hypnosis and restore those emotions because he was afraid of falling in love with her again.</p><p>But now, he is unwilling to break the hypnosis because he is afraid that if those emotions truly resurface, he will hate her.</p><p>Even though he remembers every single thing that happened between them, that feeling has been hypnotized and he feels like an observer watching a movie, rather than truly immersing himself in the plot.</p><p>And once the hypnosis is lifted and he truly becomes the character in the play, how will his emotions be affected?</p><p>Will he hate Kyla more or love her more?</p><p>Will there still be such calm and warmth between them in the future?</p><p>&quot;Since we get along well, are you not satisfied?&quot; Brian asked.</p><p>&quot;Not satisfied?&quot; Martin sighed softly, &quot;It&#x27;s not so much about being unsatisfied as it is about being too satisfied, which is why there&#x27;s a fear of losing it.&quot;</p><p>This statement made Brian feel a sense of sorrow, as he could relate to it. After all, he had experienced the same thing. Because he had lost Grace before, even if she returned to him now, sometimes he and Grace would feel scared, and he would even wake up in the middle of the night from a bad dream.</p><p>And at that time, only holding her could calm the unease in his heart.</p><p>&quot;If you&#x27;re afraid of losing, then try your best not to lose,&quot; said Brian. &quot;Everything I&#x27;m doing now is to avoid losing Grace again, because the days without her were too painful.&quot;</p><p>Martin pursed his thin lips, don&#x27;t you want to keep it?</p><p>But the instructions he gave under hypnosis for contact hypnosis were... As he thought about this, his heart couldn&#x27;t help but beat strongly again.</p><p>The party is still going on with a few women who have been drinking. Some, like Amber, are not yet drunk, while others, like Lina, are on the verge of losing control and publicly stripping Hadwin.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m telling you guys... *hiccup* my husband has a really great physique...&quot; Lina said while burping and praising her husband. She kept grabbing at Hadwin&#x27;s clothes with her hands, &quot;Especially his abs, they look so good. Every time I see them, I drool...&quot;</p><p>Hadwin looked helpless. Some people just insist on drinking even though they know they can&#x27;t handle it - like his wife!</p><p>And after getting drunk, their alcohol tolerance isn&#x27;t very good either!</p></div>
