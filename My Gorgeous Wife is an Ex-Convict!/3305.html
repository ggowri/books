        <h1>Chapter 3303</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, it was Valda's prenatal check-up day and Brian woke her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda yawned repeatedly while watching Brian, who appeared to be in good spirits. Despite having slept more than him the night before, she now seemed less energetic than him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Still sleepy?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um..." she dragged out her nasal tone for a long time, and then let out a yawn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take a nap in the car when we get there," he said as he helped her get dressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda seems to have gotten used to it. If she were sober, she would still feel a bit shy, but right now, it's clear that drowsiness has overcome her shyness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She squinted her eyes and let him help her put on the clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After putting on his clothes, he skillfully squatted in front of her and helped her put on her socks. Since her belly had grown bigger and it was inconvenient for her to bend over, he had been the one to help her with putting on her socks and shoes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked down at Brian who was crouching in front of her. Her drowsiness, which was still present a moment ago, somehow became more alert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, you will definitely be a great dad in the future," Valda suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian tilted his chin up and looked at her, "Why are you suddenly talking about this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just think you're really good at taking care of people. In the future, our children will definitely be well taken care of by you," she said. At this point, she began to envy her own baby in her belly. How nice it would be to be taken care of so gently by him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll take good care of you too, whether you're pregnant or not," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you more awake now?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then you go wash up, I'll change clothes," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," she replied, put on her slippers, and walked towards the bathroom. But just as she was about to reach the door, she turned around and saw him taking off his pajamas. His lean and strong body, as well as his model-like golden ratio, made Valda feel a surge of attraction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stop, stop!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She quickly told herself in her heart that she needed to restrain herself and not tease him casually anymore, although... um, she had the urge to rush up and touch his muscles again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda entered the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror, trying to calm herself down. After a while, she finally started washing her face and brushing her teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda didn't have breakfast because she had to fast for the blood test during her prenatal check-up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she finished drawing blood, Brian asked, "What do you want to eat later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anything is fine," she said, without any particular craving for a specific dish. "By the way, I'm going to the restroom. Please wait for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian nodded and escorted Valda to the bathroom door, then waited outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda went to the restroom and when she came to the sink to dry her hands, a woman standing next to her washing her hands glanced at her and said "huh" before staring at her without moving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked up with a puzzled expression and asked, "Is there something you need?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you Brian's wife, Valda?" the other person spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because the other person was wearing a mask, Valda couldn't recognize who it was for a moment, but... it wasn't someone familiar.</p></div>
