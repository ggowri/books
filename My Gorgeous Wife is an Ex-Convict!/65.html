        <h1>Chapter 64</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean cleared his throat. &ldquo;What manner of business is this pertaining to?&rdquo; Sean tried again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence said with a faint smile, "You will know when you meet Mr. Reed."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean undid the top button of his shirt. He was warm and getting more and more anxious.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The car stopped at the door of the Reed Residence. Sean followed Terrence into the house and saw Jason sitting on the sofa, playing with an invitation card in his hand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Sean approached, he saw that the invitation was for the engagement banquet that he and Lily had invited Jason to.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"We meet again," Jason said faintly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean was stunned. At this moment, Jason was wearing an elegant grey-blue suit. His hair was combed and tied back, showing his smooth forehead. The man had strong, even features, and while Sean wasn&rsquo;t one to normally pay too much attention to another man&rsquo;s good looks, it was impossible not to see Jason Reed and think that he was exceptional.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And it wasn&rsquo;t just the bone structure or the expression, Jason Reed radiated power. The kind of quiet, absolute confidence that told anyone in the room with him that he held all the cards and called all the shots.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His smile now, was lazy, but every bit arrogant.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was no surprise that he attracted the attention of so many women. In the upper circles, many young ladies tried their best to attract Jason, not only because of his background but also due to his appearance.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However... When Jason&rsquo;s dark eyes took in Sean, Sean had the distinct sensation of being stared at by a wild beast.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His blood seemed to have frozen again, and even his breathing became ragged.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was just like... the feeling of being stared at by that person last night.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But yesterday, he had been in the dark while Jason had been out in the open.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that time, he had been able to see Jason, but Jason Reed should not have been able to see him clearly. But now, he was completely exposed to Jason's line of sight.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean smiled dryly. "Yes." He was trying to guess if Jason's "again" was actually referring to last night, but then Jason Reed went and answered the question for him:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Did you mention what happened last night to someone else?" Jason asked in a careless manner. A careless manner that was anything but.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean felt the threat as if it had been thrown out by the tip of a sword.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His hands trembled and his heart pounded.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean was frightened!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sure enough...this visit was because of what happened last night! Although Sean already had a hunch, when he heard Jason ask in person, some of his doubts finally came to an end.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He realized abruptly, that Jason Reed was indeed the man he&rsquo;d seen holding Grace at the intersection. He was the man visiting Grace at her low-income housing. He was the man in ragged clothes with unkempt hair. And he was the same man, standing before him now.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">So in the end, Jason and Grace were indeed together!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I asked you a question,&rdquo; Jason reminded him quietly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, I didn't mention it to anyone," Sean said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's good," Jason said. "I don't want anyone else to know about this."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean swallowed past the lump in his throat. He didn&rsquo;t know what to say. He didn&rsquo;t know what Jason Reed wanted. But if Jason wanted his arrangement&mdash;whatever it was, with Grace&mdash;kept a secret, then the fact that Sean knew of it&hellip; would not bode well for him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He felt that his whole body was being crushed by the pressure in the room.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Also, I don't wish to see you there again. I don't care why you were there or what you were doing. But since you chose to break up with Grace back then, don't come and look for her anymore. Is that clear?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean was rendered speechless with shock. Jason&rsquo;s tone sounded threatening, but what was more confusing was the hint of possessiveness wrapped up in the words. Like Jason Reed wanted Grace&hellip;all to himself.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Could it be that Jason actually has feelings for Grace...? Sean couldn&rsquo;t believe it. The hair on the back of his neck stood on end, just thinking about it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I understand," Sean said with some difficulty.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright, then you can go. Terrence, send Mr. Stevens back," Jason ordered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence gave an affirmative nod.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Sean was about to leave, he couldn't help but ask, &ldquo;Mr. Reed, what is it between Grace and you&hellip;"</p></div>
