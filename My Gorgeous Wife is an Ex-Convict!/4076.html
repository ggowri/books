        <h1>Chapter 4074</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit immediately thought of the last time at the wedding, when Tina helped her friend get an autograph, and he did write "TO Eugenia"!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, was this assistant her friend?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit's gaze fell on Tina, who was talking to Weldon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since the last shoot, he had been thinking about Tina from time to time, thinking about the scene that day, and thinking about her appearance at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Neither male nor female, neither god nor demon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It caught his entire attention!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even afterwards, he went out of his way to ask the photographer for the set of photos taken with Tina and saved them on his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he was alone, he would stare at the photos in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why? Perhaps because Tina, who took those photos, was so different from her usual self that it was shocking and left a deep impression?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or was it because he had been struggling with his emotions, but with Tina's guidance, he suddenly entered the state of mind needed for the shoot?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he was the professional, and Tina was just an amateur, he felt like he had lost to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kit?" Eugenia's voice sounded in Kit's ear. "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Kit suddenly snapped out of his daze and quickly took Eugenia's autograph board. "Okay, I'll sign it for you right now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit quickly signed his name on the board.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Tina felt a strange sensation from the photographer, Weldon, who was looking at her. His gaze wasn't like that of a photographer looking at a model, but rather filled with curiosity, surprise, and even... a hint of disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Disdain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because she wasn't at a professional level?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she heard from Zabulon that Weldon specifically requested her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it wasn't for Weldon's request, she wouldn't have had the opportunity to work with Kit again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So why did Weldon's gaze contain such disdain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I saw the photos from your last shoot with Kit and thought they were good, but last time you had a more neutral look. This time, I want you to present a more feminine appearance," said Weldon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What kind of appearance?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cute and innocent, yet charming and alluring," Weldon replied. "There should be a bit of contradiction, like in your last shoot, but this time I want to see a harmonious contradiction in you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina frowned. She had always cosplayed male characters from anime and even dressed neutrally in her last shoot with Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time, it was different. She was going to be photographed as a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, if you can't do it, you can leave now and I can bring in other candidates," Weldon said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since I'm here, I might as well do the shoot," Tina smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wasn't one to back down from a challenge, and she was curious about portraying a more feminine appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, go get ready," Weldon said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Tina was about to leave, Weldon suddenly said, "By the way, I heard you're the daughter of the White Maple Group and Chandler's fianc&eacute;e."</p></div>
