        <h1>Chapter 136</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was as if she had heard his voice and she frowned suddenly. Her forehead broke out in a cold sweat and immediately, she started to shake her head left and right as if avoiding something.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason furrowed his brows and just as he wanted to call for a doctor, Grace who was still in deep slumber abruptly opened her eyes as she sat upright, shouting, "Noooo..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sister, what's wrong?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the next moment, Grace hugged Jason's waist tightly as if she were drowning. "Jay, that's great... it's you... it's you... I had a nightmare. I dreamed that I was in jail and those people would not let me go. I begged them, I... I even kowtowed to them but they continued to hit me..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Even in my dream, the pain was still so acute. Now that I'm awake, I can still feel my abdomen hurting."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She suddenly stopped mid-sentence and her entire body froze.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had just realized that this was Jason not "Jay"! "The man I'm hugging now is Jason and the pain I suffered in jail was instigated... by him."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace released her arms stiffly and her body subconsciously shifted back.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And yet, in the next moment, his arm had already looped around her waist and he pulled her straight into his embrace. "Sister, are you afraid of me?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he hugged her, he could feel her body shivering slightly like a fragile small creature reacting when faced with a predator at the top of the food chain.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She bit her lip and struggled to suppress the fear within her. "Yes, I'm afraid," She then continued frankly, "I've been taught too many lessons in prison. Fear was beaten into me..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No one will ever beat you again," he said, interrupting her. "Sister, I promise that from now on, no one will dare hit you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace raised her head dazedly and asked, "What exactly do you want?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He chuckled lightly and replied, "I've said it before. I want you to stay by my side."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You can have so many people stay by your side. Plenty of women would be willing to do so," she said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His smile grew even brighter but his eyes darkened. "So you're not willing to do it, right?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She remained silent, not knowing how to reply to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But so what if you're not willing? What else can you do?" he retorted as if amused. "You see, if I wanted you now, do you think you'll be able to do anything?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he spoke, he lowered his head and pressed his lips onto hers.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was taken aback and momentarily forgot to respond. Only when he continued to deepen the kiss, did she suddenly snap out of her trance and struggled to tilt her head to avoid his kiss.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But it was to no avail. His fingers latched onto her chin and each time she tilted her head away, his hand would pry her head back to its original position. He was utterly unavoidable and she could only bear with it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A sense of helplessness rose within her. "This is the first time I've felt the difference in strength between men and women."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just when she was about to suffocate, he finally released her lips, and she inhaled large gulps of air. "Let go of me, Jason!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he paid no mind to her and his lips trailed down her neck to leave small kisses. His fingers gently moved to unfasten the buttons of her hospital gown.</p></div>
