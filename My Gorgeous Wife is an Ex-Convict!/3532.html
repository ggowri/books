        <h1>Chapter 3530</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Lawrence's situation was a big deal for the Reed family. They had been searching for Lawrence for years, and now they finally had a lead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After another half hour, Terrence, who was Jason's personal secretary, walked into the office and handed Jason a file that had been investigated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to the angle of the surveillance cameras, it was impossible to see the person's appearance clearly. However, on that day, the person Jasper saw did deliberately avoid him and later left through a side door of the courthouse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, the car was a fake license plate and deliberately avoided some of the road surveillance, so we couldn't trace it," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason narrowed his eyes and said, "Keep investigating and see if there are any other ways to trace where they came from."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After Terrence left the office, Grace asked, 'Do you think that person could be Lawrence?'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's quite possible," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if it is Lawrence, why would he deliberately avoid us? Could there be some compelling reason?" speculated Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, no one knew what had happened to Lawrence all those years ago when he disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Perhaps there is a compelling reason, or it could be..." Jason pursed his thin lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What else could it be?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing, I might be overthinking it. Let's wait until we confirm if this person is really Lawrence," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Grace nodded. "Should we tell Jasper about it when we go back today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's wait until we're sure, so she doesn't get her hopes up for nothing," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, what worried him even more was that if this person was really Lawrence, it was probably not for any unavoidable reason, but rather because Lawrence held a grudge against the Reed family or Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that were the case, as a father, he would protect his daughter at all costs and would never let Lawrence harm Jasper in any way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few days later, Jasper received news from Jason that the person she saw in court was not Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not Lawrence?" Jasper's face was full of disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm, he just had some resemblance to Lawrence in appearance, but we investigated and it's not him," Jason said, handing his daughter a document.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There is a photo of a handsome young man in the information, who does bear some resemblance to Lawrence when he was 10 years old. However, the information clearly states that the person is not Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, she really made a mistake that day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Jasper told William about this, a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes. "Not Lawrence?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, Dad showed me the information about that person. He looks somewhat similar to Lawrence, but it's not him," Jasper said regretfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You must be disappointed," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, quite disappointing," Jasper admitted. "Although I didn't have high hopes to begin with, when Dad told me that person wasn't Lawrence, I still felt a sense of loss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe finding him wouldn't necessarily be a good thing," William said softly. "If he's really still alive, maybe he hasn't come to find you all these years because he doesn't want to appear in front of us again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But it's also possible that there are other reasons, like amnesia," Jasper reasoned. "Isn't that common in movies and TV shows?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But those are just movies and TV shows. In reality, it's not so easy to just lose your memory," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Either way, I still want to find Lawrence," Jasper insisted. This matter had become an obsession for her over the past few years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William knew that if they couldn't find Lawrence, this matter would become a permanent burden on her heart.</p></div>
