        <h1>Chapter 4225</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler stood outside the neonatal ward, looking at the tiny life inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked for a long, long time...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Tina was discharged from the hospital, she didn't return to her and Chandler's newlywed home, but went back to the Stephenson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the elders in the Hunter family opposed her decision, Chandler agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Simply because this is what Tina wanted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you thinking? Are you really that desperate to throw your life away?" Chandler's grandfather stared helplessly at his own grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tina went missing, his grandson was on the verge of losing his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina has been found, but her grandson doesn't want her to get pregnant and have another child. Instead, he wants Tina to return to the Stephenson family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina has lost her memory, and for her, returning to live with the Stephenson family is the best option," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the Stephenson family is where Tina has always lived, and now she clearly has a better attitude towards her parents than towards him. In comparison, she is more likely to accept her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She is now your wife. Even if the wedding didn't go as planned, you have already obtained a marriage certificate and are legally married. Isn't it natural for you to live together? How can others gossip about you if Tina goes back to the Stephenson family?" Grandpa said angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What others say is their business. I don't care," Chandler replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grandpa's face became increasingly unpleasant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele, who is Chandler's daughter-in-law, quickly went forward to help Grandpa sit down. She asked her son, "What are you going to do now? Tina's attitude towards you is completely different now, and she has moved back to the Stephenson family. You are spending less and less time together. How are you going to build a relationship with her? What will you do in the future if you can't develop feelings between you two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's my business," Chandler said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it is also the Hunter family's business!" Grandpa said angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele looked at her son with concern and said, "Mom knows you love Tina, but you also have to think about yourself. If there is no possibility of having a child, what will you do? Are you not going to let her have a child even if she wants to? Are you going to let yourself suffer and die in pain?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler slowly raised his eyes and looked at his mother. "Mom, I won't die. As long as Tina is still alive, I will live well too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the days ahead may be difficult and extremely challenging for him at times, he will do everything possible to keep on living.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he wants to stay by Tina's side!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he wants to grow old with Tina!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Colin sighed and patted his wife's shoulder. Then he said, "Since Chandler has made his decision, let's respect it for now. Maybe when Tina goes to live with the Stephenson family, she can remember more about the past, which will help her recover her memory. Once her memory is restored, all the problems can be solved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele felt helpless, but she knew that at this point, they could only do this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grandpa just stared at Chandler and said, "You have grown up, and there are many things that you won't listen to our advice anymore. But you have to think everything through on your own! Whatever consequences your decision may have in the future, you'll have to bear them yourself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand," Chandler said with a faint smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He already knew the consequences. When he made this decision, he knew what kind of results his future might face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he still did it without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because to him, nothing is more important than Tina!</span></p></div>
