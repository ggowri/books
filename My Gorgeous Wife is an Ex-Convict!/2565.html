        <h1>Chapter 2563</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory ran up to Amber Mitchell and blocked her way. "Are you going back now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you... want to visit Simon?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Simon?' Amber Mitchell's eyes flickered a little as hesitation appeared on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's my child... Although I didn&rsquo;t take care of him or get the chance to bond with him, I'm glad to find out that he's still alive. I've even been crying in the dead of night for days now.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to see and talk to the child. She wanted to touch and hug him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had never held the little one since he was born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing Amber Mitchell's hesitation, George Gregory continued saying, "Simon woke up yesterday. He's still a little weak, but you can go and see him. But&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pressing his thin lips together, he added, &ldquo;Because he's still weak, I&rsquo;m momentarily keeping the news from him. I didn't tell him that you're his biological mother. Don't tell him that you&rsquo;re his mother when you see him later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it," Amber Mitchell said indifferently with no expression on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory explained uneasily, "I just want to wait until he's well enough to tell him that you're his mother. I have no intention of hiding it from him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter to me whether you tell him or not," said Amber Mitchell. She only wanted the child to live well and healthily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter?" His expression changed slightly. It mattered to him, but it did not matter to her? "Would you rather he not be our child so you can distance yourself from me better?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory, what are you trying to say? Simon's our child, and that's a fact that can&rsquo;t be changed. It doesn't matter to me whether he knows I'm his mother." After going through so many things, she was exhausted and became more open-minded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only hoped that the child could survive and peacefully live the life he wanted. That was enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, Amber Mitchell continued saying, "Besides, I'm not going to fight you for the child&rsquo;s custody. You can rest assured that nothing will change."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was undoubtedly the best for Simon to stay with the Gregory family. The Gregory family could provide Simon a lavish life and meticulous care, which was beyond her ability.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Simon must have gotten used to living with the Gregory family after so many years. He was used to the Gregory family members accompanying him. She was no more than a stranger to Simon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her statement made George Gregory's heart sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He hoped that everything could change. He hoped Simon could provide them an opportunity and she could take him back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though it might take a long time and a lot of effort to get there, he was willing to do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she now told him that nothing would change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she also telling him that she would never accept him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With almost weak steps, George Gregory took Amber Mitchell to Simon's ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unlike the last time when she had seen the little one in a coma, he was not wearing an oxygen mask anymore and appeared to be in good spirits. He sat on his hospital bed building a toy car.</p></div>
