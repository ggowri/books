        <h1>Chapter 122</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Jason had squeezed out some toothpaste onto the toothbrush, he filled the cup with warm water before placing it in her hand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace blushed and had no idea how she had managed to brush her teeth a few moments later. She was surrounded by his scent.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason took a towel and wet it under the warm running water.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I can do it myself..." Grace said, biting her lips.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Isn't it easier if I do it?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although what he said was true, they were standing too close to each other! His arms were on her sides, and when he wet the towel and wrung it...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace lifted her eyes to look into the mirror.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">All along, she had known that Jason was good-looking. However, his forehead was no longer covered by the bangs, and he was in a suit, looking elegant. He seemed high up, beyond one's reach.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace hadn't noticed it in the past. Even Lina had reckoned that he was not a homeless person, but she had insisted that he was in a similar situation to her and had kept him by her side.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Was it because... I was feeling lonely?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The reality was that Jason wasn't a homeless person, and was in fact someone of distinct status.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace could tell that his attire was expensive, and the doctors and nurses had treated him with great respect.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, what are you thinking about?" Suddenly, her thoughts were cut off by his question.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She came to her senses and saw him looking at her in the mirror. Their eyes met and Grace froze. She seemed trapped by his gaze.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, your face is red," Jason muttered. He lowered his body, his lips close to her cheek. Grace felt tickled as his warm breath blew over her cheek and neck.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She blushed all the more.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why do you... still address me as sis?" She tried to look away from the mirror by lowering her eyelids.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't you like me addressing you as sis?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're not a homeless person... so you don't have to address me as your sis," she mumbled.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason was silent and the atmosphere became suffocating.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The washroom was filled with only the sounds of running water as the two of them were not saying a word.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you angry with me for deceiving you?" Jason asked after some time.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was unsure of her feelings about the deception. She detested people deceiving her, especially when it had gone on for so long.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, she had enjoyed the time that they had spent together, and it was like a dream. Moreover, if he had not saved her, her life would have become like hell on earth.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After taking a deep breath, she lifted her head to look at him in the mirror and said, "Jay, I don't blame you." She knew that from then on, he would no longer be her brother. The two of them were from different worlds.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason knitted his brows. He should have felt happy when she said that she did not blame him. However, he felt disturbed by her gaze.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She seemed to have alienated herself from him, and he did not like that feeling.</p></div>
