        <h1>Chapter 187</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurriedly got down from the bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll... go and wash up,&rdquo; she uttered out before rushing into the washroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason&rsquo;s gaze darkened as he watched the back view of Grace running away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">-</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the washroom, Grace looked at her blushing red face and sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not bring herself to believe what Jason told her earlier. &lsquo;I... pressed him down and kissed him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;How could such a thing happen!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she hesitated. Was it truly impossible? Even she did not know what sort of things her drunk self would do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;If what Jason said is true, then I...&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The possibility of that gave her the urge to bury herself alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hurriedly washed up and exited the washroom to find that Jason was still in her house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, he was sitting on a chair and gently sipping on a cup of water. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was dressed in a well-tailored suit. He was a man with broad shoulders and a slim waistline. He had one leg elegantly crossed over the other. He had a handsome face with a profound contour and delicate features. When his eyelids lowered, those lashes fanned out prettily. One could not help imagining his breathtaking appearance if his eyes were fully opened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such a person was enough to please the eyes even if he was merely sitting there. He looked like a beautifully painted portrait no matter what he did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he was holding a worthless and ordinary cup, it did not bring down his value nor reduced the aristocratic aura he had within him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Why have I never noticed this in the past!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace chided herself inwardly once again. When Jason lived here with her in the past, she should have noticed that his every movement&mdash;the way he ate, his posture, and the subtle hint of his upbringing in his interactions&mdash; was not something a vagabond would have.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same moment, Jason&rsquo;s eyelids lifted upward. That pair of exquisitely beautiful peach eyes looked at Grace. All of a sudden, she felt as if her whole being was about to sink into his pupils.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I... I need to get to work.&rdquo; She broke out from her trance with much difficulty. It was already past nine in the morning, and she was late for work by a few hours. She was going to get a pay cut and reprimanded when she got to work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;There is no need to rush. I&rsquo;ve applied for leave on your behalf,&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned for a moment. Subsequently, she heard him ask, &ldquo;By the way, where are my clothes and things that I used to have here? Have you thrown them out?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her lips but did not say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Also the pair of gloves that you made for me, have you thrown those out as well?&rdquo; he stared at her and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hesitated before replying, &ldquo;I kept it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Throw&rsquo;. It was a wasteful word for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you throw it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It's worth some money... I can still sell it as a second-hand item...&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish her sentence, his face went completely dark. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so capable of angering someone to death...&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason glared at Grace for a moment before saying, &ldquo;Since you haven&rsquo;t thrown it out, complete the gloves and give them to me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was taken aback and stared blankly at him. &lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have any need to put up a show in front of me anymore. That pair of gloves were knitted from threads of an old sweater. Why does he want it? Is he going to wear it?&rsquo;</p></div>
