        <h1>Chapter 832</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I like it very much. I didn't expect playing pool to be so interesting," Stella said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other hand, Curtis Row was busy sucking up to Brian and Stella. He was saying that Brian was a good coach and Stella was talented.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They seemed to have forgotten about Grace who was standing nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Listening to what Stella had just said, Grace only found that her cousin was good at acting. She had never thought that her cousin could lie so well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian probably already believed that her cousin was the little girl from his childhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if she did tell Brian the truth, he would probably take it as a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pain in her knees seemed to be getting more and more serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace frowned slightly with her lips pressed tightly. She was trying to ignore the pain in her knees and hold on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, she could only wait until they had finished the round before getting Curtis Row to sign the document.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With her head lowered slightly, Grace did not notice that someone was glancing at her out of the corner of their phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian knew that he should not care about Grace. They had made it clear to each other on the mountain that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was not the one he was looking for, and everything in the past was just an illusion. The one he was looking for was Lifang, and the one he wanted to repay was also Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, the person in Grace's heart was Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'However, why... is she here being bullied by someone like Curtis Row? She&rsquo;s standing for so long just to get Curtis Row's signature?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'What's going on here? Where's Jason? Isn't he extremely protective of Grace? But he just left her here to suffer?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Doubt flashed through Brian's mind. He watched as Grace's delicate face looked even paler under the light. A thin layer of sweat had already broken out on her forehead, and her lips were pressed together in a straight line as if she was suppressing something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian could not help frowning. 'What's going on with her? Is she feeling unwell?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he told himself the next moment, 'Don't think about it. Whatever's going on with her is Jason's business, not mine!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, how do I hit this ball?" Stella's deliberately softened voice rang in his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian glanced at Stella who was beside him and said, "I'll teach you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace did not know how long she had been on her feet. The pain in her knees was getting worse and worse. She was using every bit of her willpower to suppress the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'No one... will help me. Jason won't help me, and neither will Brian!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remembered Brian saying to her when they parted on the hill. &lsquo;Grace, once I put you down, I'll be indifferent to whatever happens to you from now on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Yeah. He said that, so he's doing it now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, she was not the little girl who had saved him when he was a child. She was just a stranger to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, when Curtis Row finished the first round with Brian, Grace almost stumbled forward to say, "Mr. Yu, can I have your signature? We need to use this document tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who told you to come over?" Curtis Row had just finished one round and not even talked to Brian when he was disturbed by Grace. He immediately raised his hand and waved Grace away angrily.</p></div>
