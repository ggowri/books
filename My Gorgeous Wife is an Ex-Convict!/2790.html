        <h1>Chapter 2788</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just had no idea... whether she could be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller continued to eat her breakfast with her head down. Just then, her phone rang suddenly. She looked at the caller ID and saw that it was a call from her best friend, Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly answered the call, and Camille Strickland's anxious voice rang. "Valda, have you seen the news today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The news?" Valda Theller froze slightly. "I just woke up and haven't watched the news. What's the matter? Has something big happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hurry and have a look. Brian sent you to the hospital yesterday. The photo of you two kissing is now the top trending post!" Camille Strickland said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller almost spat out the porridge in her mouth as soon as she heard that. "What... What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said the photo of you kissing Brian is now trending online. Though your face in the trending photo is censored, the original photo isn't. You'd better be mentally prepared. Many people will probably learn about your relationship with Brian," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was shocked. 'Well, I never expected myself to be in a top trending post one day.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not intend to conceal her relationship with Brian. However, the thought of her dating the crown prince of the entertainment industry and being secretly filmed by reporters for gossip material made her scared and worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Brian asked after seeing something wrong with her expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Camille said a photo of you and me kissing in the hospital last night is now the top trending post." Valda Theller looked at him awkwardly and said, "Did I kiss you by force last night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she knew Brian did not like her at all. He had feelings for someone else. There was no way he would take the initiative to kiss her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyelashes gently quivered. "You didn't kiss me by force."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean?" she asked, blinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You asked me before you kissed me last night. I agreed," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Valda Theller was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh, what did I do after getting drunk last night?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm sorry. I was drunk! You can just ignore me or reject me the next time I ask you something like that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her. "Are you regretting it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze as she suddenly recalled how his phoenix eyes had seemingly stared at her in the empty hospital. The words that came out of his thin lips were&hellip; "If you think you won't regret it, then... okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart could not help clenching. She bit her lip as she blushed and said, "I... I don't regret it. I... I'm just scared it'll trouble you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "You're my girlfriend. It won't trouble me that you want to kiss me. If you don't regret yesterday, I won't regret it either. But I didn't expect it to be trending online. I'll take care of it. Don't worry. No reporter in Emerald City will come looking for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was relieved. Even if she said nothing, he knew what bothered her.</p></div>
