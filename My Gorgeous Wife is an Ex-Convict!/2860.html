        <h1>Chapter 2858</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the next few days, her uncle's family did not approach her again, nor did they call her. Valda Theller found it a little strange. 'Has Uncle's family given up?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that her uncle's illness must be fake. Her uncle would have come to her with medical records and examination reports to ask for money if it were true. How could he give up so easily?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The comic fiesta was approaching, so Valda Theller also prepared some small gifts like drawings she had drawn for her readers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two days before the comic fiesta, Valda Theller sent Brian the address and the booth number of the booth the company rented for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she thought he would come over after work if he had time, it sounded like he would come over during the day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the day of the comic fiesta, the number of readers who attended the book signing was much higher than Valda Theller had expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While signing autographs, some readers asked about her relationship with Brian and whether she was the crown prince's girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller replied the same thing to those questions. "That's personal. I can't answer that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller felt her hand becoming so sore it was going to break when she finally got to rest at noon. Signing so many autographs all at once was more exhausting than she had expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think many people today aren't my readers. They're only curious about me because of my relationship with Brian," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you upset?" Camille Strickland asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not really upset. I&rsquo;ll take it as though they&rsquo;re here to support the event and keep the book signing from being too quiet," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she was dating Brian, she had to deal with these situations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The book signing continued in the afternoon. When Valda Theller was signing autographs, a man suddenly rushed up to Valda Theller and said sternly, "Valda Theller, you have the cheek to have a book signing? After your parents died, my father raised you, but you refuse to pay any money now that he&rsquo;s sick. You refused without hesitation when we asked you to lend us some money. How dare you sign autographs for others?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was immediately an uproar all around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of the onlookers pulled out their phones and began filming the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller frowned. The person making a scene was her cousin, Wynne. She thought her uncle's family had given up when they were quiet and did nothing in the past few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was clear that she was too naive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland immediately lunged forward and got between Valda Theller and Wynne. "This is a book signing. Please leave immediately!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Leave? Why should I leave? I'm here to show you the true colors of this rookie comic artist!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Wynne started to play a recording on his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's expression changed when she heard the recording. The recording was her conversation at her uncle's house that day, but the conversation was obviously edited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If others heard the edited recording, she would only be seen as heartless, stingy, selfish, and ungrateful. They would think she was living comfortably and had a super rich boyfriend, but she was unwilling to pay anything for her relatives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough, Wynne. What's the point in using an edited recording?" Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Edited? Is that all you can say to hide your guilt? Valda Theller, my father is lying in the hospital right now. Isn't it true that my father is sick? Isn't it true that I asked you to borrow us money because we can't afford the medical fees? And isn't it true that you didn&rsquo;t lend us money?"</p></div>
