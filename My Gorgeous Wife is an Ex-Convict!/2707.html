        <h1>Chapter 2705</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla walked up the stairs and headed toward the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she reached the study door, she looked at the closed door and took a deep breath. She wondered how he would treat her. Indifferently or...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raising her hand, she knocked on the door before gently pushing it open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the study, Shana Nicholls was waiting on Martin Weiss and helping him take his medicine. Some needed to be taken before meals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Shana Nicholls frowned when she saw Kyla entering the study. "Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why can't it be me? Nurse Ruan, do I need your permission to see Martin in the study?" Kyla asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls's expression changed slightly. Out of the corners of her eyes, she glanced at Martin Weiss's expressionless face before replying, "Of course not. It's just that a servant would normally be serving food at this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla walked up to Martin Weiss. "I made today's dinner. Can you come down and eat with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's unnecessary," Martin Weiss said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla only felt as if she had been stung in the heart. "We're still married. I only want to have a meal with you. Think of it as fulfilling one of my wishes, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pleading tone made Martin Weiss hesitate. However, he recalled how he had gone down on his knees and begged her for another chance, but she had heartlessly refused him. He instantly rejected and said, "You want me to fulfill your wish? But have you ever fulfilled my wish, Kyla? Don't ever tell me such a ridiculous thing again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned pale instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to ask the servants to serve the food. Your cooking might not be to my taste," he said before instructing Shana Nicholls, "Manlo, ask the cook to cook me another meal and bring it upstairs later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Mr. Weiss," Shana Nicholls replied with a burst of joy. Mr. Weiss would not dine with Kyla or even eat her cooking. It seemed that she need not worry too much about Mr. Weiss having feelings for his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls hurried out of the study and down the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked coldly at Kyla. "What's the matter? What are you still doing standing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you... hate me so much that you won't even have a meal with me?" Kyla asked in a mutter. Her eyes felt so sore that she wanted to cry, but she was seemingly unable to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe... she did not want to cry in front of him. This man&rsquo;s greatest concern back when he loved her was her tears. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said her tears were a weapon that could hurt him. She was now unwilling to hurt him even if he did not love her anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "I just find it irritating and want to end our relationship as soon as possible. We both know that our marriage has no meaning now. Don't you feel exhausted continuing to pretend to be a family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She broke into a chuckle. 'Pretending to be a family... So he thinks we&rsquo;re only pretending to be a family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does my persistence still matter?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even only three months irritated him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After taking a deep breath, Kyla said to Martin Weiss, "So, will you pretend to be a family with me one last time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean?" He narrowed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just play pretend. We'll spend a day like an ordinary married couple. I'll set the itinerary. After the day ends, I'll sign the divorce papers and head back to Emerald City. We'll have nothing to do with each other, just like you hope. If the kids miss you or vice versa, I won't get in the way. You can meet anytime, but I'll never appear in front of you again."</p></div>
