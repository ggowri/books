        <h1>Chapter 3315</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's had some conflicts with her friends and has been unhappy for a while," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper is mad at her friend? But she doesn't seem like the type to stay mad for so long. What kind of conflict is it?" Valda asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, in her opinion, how big could conflicts between children really be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's a little different this time, and it involves adults too," Grace said, not hiding anything as she quietly explained the situation with the Lawrence family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy upon hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, it's just like this, the human heart can easily become greedy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When one's life circumstances suddenly change and there is a possibility of upward social mobility without much effort, there is an unconscious desire for more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, this is not wrong and it's a thought that many people have.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The mistake was simply that the Abbott family shouldn't have tried to use the Reed family and Jasper's feelings for Lawrence to their advantage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the Reed family were so easily manipulated, they wouldn't have achieved their current status.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, Lawrence is still a child, so he shouldn't have such thoughts yet. At most, he just listens to his parents and behaves better in front of Jasper," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had actually met Lawrence before and remembered him as a child with delicate features and a somewhat timid appearance. He didn't speak much, but he always did what Jasper asked him to do and behaved quite well. His eyes were also very pure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lawrence is a good kid, it's just a pity that he has parents like that," Grace sighed and said, "Now that the child has caused such trouble, it's unlikely that they will continue to learn the piano together. However, as long as Lawrence is willing, I will continue to sponsor his piano lessons and any other fees he needs. I hope that he can also succeed in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda glanced again at Jasper, who was watching cartoons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Being betrayed by someone you value and realizing that they were only using you can be an incredibly painful experience. She has gone through this herself, so she can understand just how difficult it can be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps for Jasper, this is an inevitable experience in life because she is the daughter of the Reed family. Her birth status has predetermined that many people will flatter and approach her throughout her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It is up to him to determine whether it is genuine or fake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other side, Brian and Jason were also discussing Jasper's matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are really willing to let your daughter go through this setback," Brian said. After all, with Jason's ability, there are many ways to avoid such things, rather than letting the child face the cruel truth directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, in Brian's opinion, this truth is a bit too early for a 10-year-old child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if it's hard to let go, she still has to go through it. Since this has happened, it's better to give her an early understanding of the situation, which might not be a bad thing," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can easily wait a few more years before letting her know," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you also can't guarantee that the harm she will suffer won't be greater," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In short, if it were my daughter, I wouldn't want her to go through all of this at such a young age." Brian couldn't bear the thought of his own daughter being unhappy for so long, being betrayed and used by friends, and looking tearful and pitiful.</p></div>
