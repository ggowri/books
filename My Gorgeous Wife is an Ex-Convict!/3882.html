        <h1>Chapter 3880</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These were the bodyguards arranged by Mason to protect Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cato was embarrassed and pressed to the ground, his face turning red. He tried to twist his body to get rid of the restraint, but it was futile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you doing, let me go!" Cato shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other people were at a loss and wanted to help Cato, but they didn't dare to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You splashed me with soup. You came to apologize because of the pressure from the Reed family. If my boyfriend didn't have the background of the Reed family, if he was just an ordinary person, you wouldn't apologize at all. You might even think that splashing me with soup was a lesson for me, right?" Veronica spoke up. "So now, I'm just giving you a taste of your own medicine. This is a lesson for you. I hope you can learn from it and don't think you can rely on your family background. There will always be people with a stronger background than you in this world."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Veronica finished speaking, she ignored the people at the door and closed the door for peace and quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyway, the remaining matters would be handled by the bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Mason returned, he said to Veronica, "Those people won't come to bother you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you ask your family to pressure and obstruct the business of the person who splashed soup on me?" Veronica asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm, I talked to my dad and didn't want to let the person who splashed soup on you off the hook." Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't bear to let anyone insult his cherished baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I heard from the bodyguards that you haven't forgiven them." he added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica sneered, "Why should I forgive them? They didn't do anything worth forgiving. They were just bullying others with their power. Now that they've met someone stronger than themselves, they're willing to back down. If it were someone without a background next time, they would still act the same way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, she had no desire for forgiveness or sympathy towards them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you mention my pregnancy to Uncle Reed when you talked to him?" Veronica asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Didn't you want to keep it a secret for now? So, I didn't say anything," Mason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's wait until after the ultrasound tomorrow to tell them," Veronica said. Just thinking about the upcoming examination made her nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Are you worried?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mm-hmm," she murmured softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry. I'm here. Get some rest, and we'll go to the hospital when you wake up," his voice was naturally cold, but when it was filled with tenderness, it could calm her inner anxiety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica hugged Mason tightly, "It's strange. When I went to the hospital to check if I was pregnant, I was scared and hoped that I wasn't. I always felt that I was too young to be a mother, and I didn't have the confidence to be a good one. But now, I hope that the baby in my belly is healthy. I... want to be its mother!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night, Veronica fell asleep with her face pressed tightly against Mason's chest, as if she could gain endless courage from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, when it was time for her ultrasound, she took a deep breath. Her nerves were even more tense than when she took the college entrance exam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she lay on the ultrasound table, the cold instrument examining her abdomen, she felt her heart beating faster and faster until the doctor examining her said that there was a fetal sac and heartbeat. Finally, the tension dissipated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, tears streamed down her face.</p></div>
