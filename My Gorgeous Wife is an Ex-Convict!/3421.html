        <h1>Chapter 3419</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason didn't apologize to Daniel and his friends for the fight. Several students who were injured by Mason that day were sent to the hospital. Although their injuries were not serious, they were kept in the hospital for observation overnight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the Reed family's side, after learning about their son's fight, they didn't retaliate against the students as the school teachers feared. Instead, they went to the hospital and apologized to the students and their parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was unexpected and a relief for the school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In any case, it's best that this matter is resolved without any major consequences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Veronica and Mason's classmates, the gossip about them has escalated, with some even directly asking Veronica if she and Mason are dating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was taken aback by this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could she possibly be dating Mason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason is my little brother!" Veronica said seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What little brother? He's not even your real brother! Besides, you two are so close, and that senior seemed interested in you that day. Mason even fought him, so obviously there's something going on between you and Mason," the other person said ambiguously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's face darkened. "Mason and I are just siblings. There's nothing going on between Mason and me like you're suggesting. If you keep spreading rumors, be prepared for the consequences!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Veronica's backer is Mason, and Mason's backer is the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Veronica really loses her temper, she'll have the backing of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's stop talking about it." The person muttered for a while, but when their gaze suddenly caught sight of something behind Veronica, their face changed and they hurriedly ran away, as if they were afraid of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was startled and turned around to see that Mason was standing not far away from her, though she didn't know when he had arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, those black eyes were fixedly staring at her, and his lips were almost pursed into a straight line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is he...angry?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica suddenly had this realization, but... what was he angry about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is she angry about the things she said to someone else just now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason..." Veronica approached and said, "Did you hear what others said just now? Don't mind those words, they were just talking nonsense!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace pressed her lips together and remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Until it was time to go home after school, he didn't say much to Grace, at most just responding with a simple "mm-hmm" when she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica couldn't do anything about it. She couldn't just force Mason to talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they were about to enter the house, he suddenly spoke up and asked, "Are we just siblings to each other?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" She paused for a moment, then said, "Of course, I treat you like a younger brother, no, even closer than a younger brother!" After all, she had a half-brother named Lionel Barlow, but her feelings towards Lionel were not very strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From childhood to adulthood, she relied on Mason more than anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His lips tightened, and he walked straight into the house without saying anything, leaving Veronica confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did she say something wrong? Why does he seem even more unhappy now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few days later, Veronica ran into Daniel again at school, and when Daniel saw Veronica, he was momentarily stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry!" Veronica said. "That day, I didn't know my brother would suddenly become violent. I'm very sorry that he hurt you and your friend."</p></div>
