        <h1>Chapter 4245 Chandler's Attitude</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina recognized them. These people were the henchmen of that man. They were the ones who had beaten Kit earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, </span><span>Tina stood before hit, trying to</span><span> </span><span>protect Kit</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>A</span><span>nd </span><span>she </span><span>nervously looked at those </span><span>people.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler lowered his gaze, observing every move Tina made.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>I&rsquo;m</span><span> </span><span>really unlucky</span><span> today</span><span>. You all came here to ruin my plans. You brought this upon yourselves," the man said fiercely. He then raised his hand, intending to order his henchmen to attack Chandler and Tina together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would relieve his pent-up anger from earlier.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as Chandler slowly raised his head and looked at the man, he coldly said, "Walter, not long ago, I remember you had someone ask to meet with me. Is this what you call a meeting?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's pupils suddenly constricted as he stared at Chandler in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who had wanted to meet not long ago was clearly...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are..." </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How </span><span>wa</span><span>s </span><span>this possible?! How could this person be here? This person </span><span>wa</span><span>s</span><span>...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind,</span><span> </span><span>Walter</span><span> switched his</span><span> </span><span>gaze </span><span>to</span><span> Tina.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this woman</span><span> was</span><span> really the daughter of the Stephenson family, then everything would make sense!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Trembling, Walter said, "You are Mr. Hunter?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems </span><span>that </span><span>you do know</span><span> who I am</span><span>," Chandler said coldly</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"So, what do you plan to do now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter felt a chill running up from his feet to his spine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler Hunter of the Hunter family!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was someone Walter couldn't afford to provoke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that anyone who angered Chandler never had a good outcome!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hunter, I was also thinking of your best interests. This Kit is not a good person. He somehow seduced my mother, and now he </span><span>seems to have hooked up</span><span> with Miss. Stephenson. I couldn't stand by and watch, so I did this!" Walter desperately tried to shift the blame onto Tina and Kit, hoping Chandler would spare him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're talking nonsense!" Tina exclaimed angrily. "Chandler..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at Tina, who was eager to explain. "Tina, you don't need to say anything. I understand it all!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, he looked at Walter again. "Are you planning to leave Emerald City on your own, or do you want me to chase you out? From now on, I don't plan on seeing you in Emerald City again."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's face changed, realizing he could no longer stay in Emerald City.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only advantage was that his life was spared!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hurriedly walked away toward the end of the alley, and his henchmen naturally followed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way!" Chandler's voice suddenly rang out. "If I hear any rumors or gossip about Tina from you in the future, I will make sure you won't be able to utter a single word!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Walter's face turned pale as he could only nod and obediently say, "Yes...yes..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Walter and his henchmen left, Chandler walked up to Tina and Kit. He glanced at Kit, who was covered in injuries, and said to Tina, "Let me help him up."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was taken aback, witnessing Chandler bend down and assist Kit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Kit was stunned, seemingly not expecting Chandler to willingly help him up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll take him to the hospital," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go </span><span>with you</span><span>!" Tina snapped back to reality and said.</span></p></div>
