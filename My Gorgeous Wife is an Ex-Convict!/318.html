        <h1>Chapter 317</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was&hellip; this place?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was stunned. Then, her mind began to recall the previous scene, and she sat up immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She drank again and even got drunk!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you awake?" A voice rang in the room. Lina stiffened and turned her head to one side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure enough, Hadwin was sitting on a sofa not far from the bed. His eyes were on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm&hellip; I'm awake..." she stuttered and scrambled out of the bed. She looked at her clothes. They were all intact, so she supposed... nothing had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina thought so to herself, but just in case, she asked, "Did I do anything when I was drunk?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You did a lot of things. Which one do you want me to say?" Hadwin asked lazily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina's jaw dropped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A lot of things... What&hellip; What did she do?! Her head was now in a mess after getting drunk this time, unlike the previous time when she remembered almost everything that had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What&hellip; What did I do?" She swallowed the sudden flow of saliva in her throat and asked cautiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He blushed for no apparent reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina gawked at the sight of his blushing cheeks. Suddenly, she found that he looked a little like the man she remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did I... force myself on you again last night?" she blurted, and the next thing she knew, he was blushing even more. He even turned his head away uncomfortably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina had an impulse to beat herself to death. Oh God! No way. Did she make the same mistake twice?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Well&hellip; Just because she woke up with her clothes intact did not mean nothing had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"About that... How did I 'force' myself on you?" Lina, in the spirit of seeking truth from facts, sought proof with great care. She wanted to know if she had any chance of making it up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough!" Hadwin groaned. He managed to calm down and keep his face from turning as red as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just now when she asked him, he remembered that when he had brought her into the room, she suddenly opened her eyes and put her arms around his neck, kissing all over his face like a puppy who would lick people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was kissing and saying things like "You smell so good, so soft, and so delicious&hellip;&rdquo; This woman was the same as before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even now he could still feel her breath on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, from this day on, we're dating and you have to fall in love with me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina gawked at him, seriously doubting whether she heard him right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin stopped talking. He turned on the recording app on his phone and played the recording of their conversation earlier. Lina almost stumbled and fell to the ground when she heard herself saying yes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had to date Hadwin and fall in love with him... Could it be that his revenge was to wait until she falls in love with him and get rid of her so that she could experience the feeling of being abandoned?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina began to think imaginatively. After all, was this not often portrayed in TV dramas.</p></div>
