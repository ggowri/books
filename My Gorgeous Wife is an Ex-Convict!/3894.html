        <h1>Chapter 3892</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, otherwise I wouldn't look good standing next to you," Veronica said. His height required her to wear higher heels so that they would look more coordinated standing together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But your feet will hurt, won't they?" He didn't seem to understand why she would rather endure the pain to wear such high heels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Today is a once-in-a-lifetime wedding, I want to look as good as possible! Even if my feet hurt, I can endure it!" Veronica said. "Just when we get out of the car, walk a little slower, I'm afraid I won't be able to walk fast and might fall."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I'll support you," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, if I make a mistake during the wedding, will it be embarrassing? Maybe I should review the wedding program when we get to the hotel," Veronica felt nervous as the car approached the hotel, even though she didn't feel that way last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was afraid that something would go wrong during the wedding!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if you make a mistake during the wedding, there's nothing to be embarrassed about. This is our wedding, why care about other people's opinions," Mason said, holding Veronica's hand. "With me here, you don't need to be nervous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The warmth of his hand eased her tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, with him by her side, she didn't have to worry about anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the car arrived at the hotel entrance, Mason got out first. Veronica took a deep breath and put her hand on Mason's outstretched hand, then got out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as they got out of the car, there were flashes and the sound of cameras clicking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although there were security personnel on both sides of the hotel entrance, blocking the onlookers and reporters, it still felt oppressive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica took a deep breath and faced the people and cameras outside bravely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since she was going to marry Mason, she had to bear all of this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as Mason was by her side, nothing was scary!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them walked into the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the crowd outside the hotel lingered on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was still some time before the wedding began, so Veronica was in the hotel's makeup room, where the makeup artist was touching up her makeup, and the two bridesmaids were with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the groom, Mason stood at the entrance of the wedding venue with his two groomsmen to welcome the guests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick looked at his younger brother, who was about to become the groom, and couldn't help but say, "I never thought you would be the first one to get married."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason raised an eyebrow and replied, "Who did you think would be the first one to get married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick remained silent, but his gaze shifted towards William, who was standing on the other side of Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, William and Jasper had always had a good relationship and were stable together, so naturally he thought Jasper would be the first one to get married among the triplets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Feeling Mick's gaze, William smiled. He also hoped that he and Jasper could get married soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The guests arrived one after another, and the three of them politely received them according to the program.</p></div>
