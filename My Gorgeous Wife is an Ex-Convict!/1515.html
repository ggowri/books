        <h1>Chapter 1513</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes were beautiful, but they exuded coldness as if they were devoid of emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason narrowed his eyes. Even his son had heard of those rumors? It seemed that someone was really aiming for something they should not want. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Jason replied, unquestionably certain in his answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; The kid did not say anything else after hearing his answer. With that, the conversation between father and son ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A servant came in and helped the child wash up, while Jason returned to his study. He walked to stop in front of a chest of drawers. After momentary consideration, he slowly pulled a drawer out. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In it was a marriage certificate. The certificate was now defunct, though, after the death of one-half of the couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stared at the woman&rsquo;s photo on the certificate. She had a very clean face and was smiling. Her smile was one that was calm and gentle as if it could soothe one&rsquo;s annoyances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">To him, though, the only merit of this face was that it was comfortable to look at. It did not amaze him as he had seen too many beautiful women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However&hellip; He had fallen in love with this woman, married her, and let her give birth to children for him. Why?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even if he were to marry, he would have done so with a woman with similar statuses, such as Jennifer. Why had he set his eyes on a woman who had been to prison?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Some images would occasionally appear in his mind, but the face of the woman in those memories was always blurred. Although Terrence had told him that the woman was Grace, Mick&rsquo;s birth mother, he still felt nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Thanks to those short fragments and Terrence&rsquo;s additional words regarding his lost memories, he approximately knew what had gone on between him and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He understood, but he felt nothing about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although other people had done that to him and he had loved Grace, no part of it felt real to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Grace, you still abandoned me in the end. If I&rsquo;ve forgotten about you, it means that I never loved you enough from the start. That&rsquo;s why I could forget about you so easily,&rdquo; he said softly and then casually tossed the marriage certificate into the drawer as if he was no longer attached to it at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In a high-speed train heading to Emerald City, an extremely cute young girl who looked to be about five years old was rifling through the stack of photos she was holding. She said to the woman beside her who was clad in a long white dress, &ldquo;Mommy, Daddy is so handsome. Are you sure he&rsquo;s really my daddy? You didn&rsquo;t just download a photo from somewhere on the internet, did you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mommy often tended to misidentify people as someone else. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true this time! He really is your daddy!&rdquo; Grace said, exasperated. The girl could not be blamed, though. She had a bad track record.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was not to be blamed for that, however. She had fallen into the sea and lost all her memories. When she woke up again, she was already in a hospital in L City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Someone had paid for all her expenses and set an identity card beside her. The name on the card was still &lsquo;Grace&rsquo;, but the other information was not right. </p></div>
