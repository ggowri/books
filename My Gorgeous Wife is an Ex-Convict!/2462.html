        <h1>Chapter 2460</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pondered slightly before saying, "Herman Moss is buried in the Moss family's private cemetery. If you want to see him, you'll have to get permission from the Moss family, but you know what the Moss family's attitude toward you is like. They probably won't agree. After the specialists confirm that you're not mentally ill, we'll find a way to let you pay your respects to Herman Moss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell opened her eyes, but the light and longing in them had faded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew the Moss family would never allow her into the cemetery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she... must pay her respects to Herman. She owed Herman so much. How could she not visit him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace left, Amber Mitchell secretly made up her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the middle of the night, she silently got up. She avoided the hospital&rsquo;s security guards, sneaked out of the hospital, and took a taxi to the Moss family's private cemetery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paid the fare with the phone she had gotten from Grace after saying that she wanted to know about the current events in society.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had also transferred some money into her account on the phone so that she could buy anything she wanted online. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paid the taxi fare for the trip. In the middle of her journey, she asked the driver to go to a shop where she could buy incense and candles. These were the things she needed to pay her respects. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cemetery seemed eerie in the middle of the night, but it was the place Amber Mitchell wanted to go to the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the Moss family had arranged for security guards to guard the cemetery, such places were rarely visited, especially at this late hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell sneaked into the cemetery while carefully avoiding the security guards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea where Herman Moss was buried, so she had to check from tombstone to tombstone. Her eyes anxiously swept across each of the tombstones. She was hoping to find Herman's tombstone before someone found her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she stopped as her eyes fell on a tombstone in the moonlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The words &lsquo;Herman Moss&rsquo; on the tombstone caught her eye. Tears came streaming down her eyes and rolled down her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pounced toward the tombstone while trembling and got down on her knees with a thump.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her knees hit the ground hard, but she felt no pain. Her hands touched the name on the tombstone, and she cried harder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Herman, I'm sorry..." Her hoarse voice apologized repeatedly as she sobbed. Her right hand that was missing a finger touched the name on the tombstone repeatedly as if she was touching the man who risked his life to protect her back then. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all these years, she only came to pay him her respects today!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would he blame her if he knew?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was crying, but she was worried that she would catch the cemetery guards&rsquo; attention if she cried too loudly. She had yet to pay her respects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell tried hard to suppress her voice and sobs. After a while, Amber Mitchell took a deep breath and quietly lit the candles and incense she had bought. She then knelt before Herman Moss's tombstone and kowtowed forcefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Herman, I won't let your death be in vain. I'll... live a good life. I won't waste the life you exchanged for mine. I have a lot of things to do. Watch me. Watch me catch your murderer! Will you give me your blessing to find the person who did this to you?" Amber Mitchell muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The rustle of the wind seemed to be responding to her in the silent night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace received a phone call from the hospital, telling her that Amber Mitchell had secretly left the hospital. From the hospital&rsquo;s surveillance footage, they learned that Amber Mitchell had left alone in a taxi.</p></div>
