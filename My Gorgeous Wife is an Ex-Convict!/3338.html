        <h1>Chapter 3336</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, when Jasper woke up, she found William sleeping next to her and was stunned for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she was still young, she was already aware of the difference between boys and girls. Although she used to sleep with William when she was younger, they had hardly done so in the past three or four years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...um..." She scratched her head and for a moment didn't know how to speak, but her face turned slightly red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William had already woken up by now and looked at Jasper's embarrassed expression. "Good morning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good morning!" She quickly replied, blushing. "I'm sorry, I fell asleep hugging you last night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William asked in a strange tone, "Why are you saying sorry? Haven't we often fallen asleep together before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But... but we have grown up now. You are a boy and I am a girl, we cannot sleep together anymore," said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William paused for a moment and asked, "Don't you like sleeping with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I didn't," Jasper shook her head and said. In fact, she slept quite well last night. It had been a long time since Lawrence disappeared, and she hadn't slept so well in a while. It felt very comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since there's no dislike, what's wrong with it? We're just sleeping together, like we did when we were kids," said William. "Anyway, Jasper, no matter when or how old you are, if you want to sleep with me, you don't have to apologize."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at William with a dazed expression for a while before asking, "Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We're good friends! Jasper is my best friend!" said William, but in his heart, he silently thought - because she is the most important person to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as she needs him, he can do whatever she wants him to do, no matter what it is!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the two children finished washing up and had breakfast, one of them said, "Jasper, didn't you say that the new amusement park in Emerald City is really fun? I haven't been there yet. You said you would take me to play together last time, remember?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Jasper didn't really feel like going to the amusement park, he nodded when he saw William's hopeful expression and said, "Okay, let's go to the amusement park."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned her head and looked at Grace, saying, "Mommy, can we go to the amusement park today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, I'm free today, I'll take you guys there," said Grace. Then she caught a glimpse of a triumphant little smile on William's lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She immediately understood that William didn't really want to go to the amusement park, but rather it was for Jasper. He wanted Jasper to think about sad things as little as possible, so he suggested going to the amusement park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace went to the amusement park with her two children. Today, there weren't too many people at the park, which saved them a lot of time waiting in line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, William is more lively than usual. He is often curious and asks Jasper what this and that are. He even makes Jasper his guide, keeping him busy introducing fun places and explaining how to use different facilities. Jasper hardly has any free time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William and Jasper went shopping together at the amusement park's stores. They bought some cartoon-themed merchandise such as small aprons, capes, and headbands. William even convinced Jasper to wear them with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After putting them on, the two children looked very cute. Even Grace couldn't resist taking many photos of them with her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And on Jasper's face, a smile gradually appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two children played on many amusement rides.</p></div>
