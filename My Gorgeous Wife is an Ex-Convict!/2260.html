        <h1>Chapter 2258</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss returned to his car and started it. Then, the car slowly drove away from the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The last thing he saw in the rearview mirror was Kyla smiling at Chase Harper...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had not shown him such a smile in so many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss withdrew his gaze and told himself again that maybe it was best not to disturb her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Kyla finished checking the goods Chase Harper brought over, she looked up to find that Martin Weiss was no longer in the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">An indescribable sense of loss instantly rose in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he... gone? Did he just leave without a word?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh? Is Mr. Weiss gone?" Chase Harper's voice rang out in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, he's gone," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you and Mr. Weiss made up and gotten back together?" asked Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze before quickly denying it. "No, we&rsquo;re just like before. We're not really together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper scratched his head in embarrassment. "I thought you had gotten back together. The way you looked around for him just now was as if you were afraid you couldn't find him. I thought you two..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper's unintentional words set off a storm in Kyla's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was I afraid... I couldn't find Martin Weiss? How is that possible?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... the sense of loss that remained in her heart seemed to remind her of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it true that I have no affection left for Martin Weiss? Or&hellip; is there still a lingering affection I don't know about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason got out of the bathroom in the evening, he saw Grace reading a law book, but she was in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He came up to her, pulled her into his arms, and whispered in her ear, "What are you thinking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She snapped back to her senses and blushed faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were already married for so long, but she still could not help blushing at his sudden act of intimacy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace muttered, "I'm just thinking about Kyla and Martin Weiss. They looked like an ordinary family of three when I saw them today. Nelson was also smiling more, and Kyla didn&rsquo;t seem to reject Martin Weiss as much as before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "So I think perhaps Kyla would be happier if she stayed with Martin Weiss. I disliked Martin Weiss at first. After all, he wronged Kyla so much. But he has remained by Kyla's side all these years and never had anything going on with other women. He... must really love Kyla."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If one&rsquo;s love was not deep, one would not be able to stay with the same person for so many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "His love for Kyla is far deeper than one can imagine, but Kyla is also more indifferent than ordinary people. Any ordinary person would have forgiven him long ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "That's because Kyla was deeply hurt. Kyla is only indifferent because she was too greatly disappointed in the past. That&rsquo;s why she's not willing to be with Martin Weiss even if she's willing to forgive him."</p></div>
