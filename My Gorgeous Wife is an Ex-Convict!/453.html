        <h1>Chapter 452</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was angry that he was jealous of an actor and even a mere TV role. However, he could only accept it because of Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he pressured her, she could take it. If he was nice to her, she would push her luck and he could do nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Hadwin suddenly felt a little more relaxed when Lina said that Grace was also Howell Webb's fan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that he was not the only one to feel bitter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason and Hadwin took turns driving the car, each driving half the way. By the time they reached the detention center in S City, it was already past nine o'clock. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin already had everything arranged, so they went into a room next to the meeting room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were several large screens in the room, which showed images of the meeting room. They could see what was going on inside and hear the conversations of the people inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, the mediator came into the room where Grace was. Grace told him the key questions she had come up with and communicated with him about how to ask the questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was clearly experienced and had already thought of many questions without being reminded by Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was glad that Hadwin found a good mediator to assist her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After communicating with Grace, the mediator went to the meeting room next door and waited. Soon, the police came with the witness whose last name was You.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace saw the witness, she stared at the screen. Of course, she recognized the face. This man had testified in court that she drank alcohol on the night of the accident. Even when she said she was wronged and asked the man to recall hard, the man insisted that he had seen her drinking. He then described the incidents like they actually happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, he was only one of the witnesses. There were so many that their testimonies and physical evidence formed a whole chain of evidence she could not argue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why... Why&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she kept asking herself this, but no one could give her an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could she finally get an answer today?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The mediator was talking to You Lei right now. He talked about how to resolve this issue so that the impact of this issue could be minimized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With his skills, the mediator steered the conversation from compensation to the house You Lei now lived in as well as his family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no matter how he asked, You Lei insisted that his house of five million was bought with the money he made when he helped his friend with his business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I paid for the house with my life. How can I possibly sell it? No way, I don't have a million for them! I don't have more than 100,000 bucks!" said You Lei.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you buy the house with clean money? Those people know you have such a house. If you don't pay them more and they find out you got it illegally, you'll only lose a lot more when you're just trying to save a little."</p></div>
