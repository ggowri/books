        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He hugged her hard, even though it only made his pain worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had no idea how much strength her words had given him to keep enduring the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, wait for me. Give me a little more time," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would come clean to her after he got rid of the blood curse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina could attend GB's concert after all. She was in the VIP room where she was not pushed around by a crowd of fans. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sitting in the private room, she looked at the transparent glass in front of her. It showed the stage, as well as the many screens that provided the view from different angles. She got to see the concert in all directions, so to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina could not help but sigh at the power of money. Even so, she did not enjoy the concert much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Do you dislike it?" asked Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I just find it a little weird. I find a concert more fun when you can scream and go crazy with everyone," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I thought you wanted to see GB's concert just to see those five guys and nothing else matters as long as you get to see them?" Hadwin Stephenson said lazily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina coughed furiously. "That's... You can&rsquo;t say that. I'm not just looking at those men&rsquo;s faces."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What else is there to see?" he asked, raising his eyebrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Figure!' Lina said in her head, but she said, "Talent. They sing very well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?" asked Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, there was music on the stage again, but this time, it was an old song that was romantic and slow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The five members of GB stood in the center of the stage to sing this love song.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina did not expect Hadwin Stephenson to sing along when GB began to sing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Instantly, her attention was drawn to him. She seemed not to hear GB's voices at all, only his!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's voice was a baritone with a melodious tone that was rare among men. It made her feel as though there was a feather gently swaying in her heart. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was still in a daze even when Hadwin Stephenson was done singing the song.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had no idea Hadwin Stephenson could sing so well. She had heard Hadwin Stephenson sing before, but he had not sung this well back when they were dating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Well? Am I talented?" he asked nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Uh... Sure,&rdquo; she mumbled to herself a little and asked, "But how can you sing so well?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You can be good at singing after some learning," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Did you learn to sing? Why?" She seemed surprised. He did not seem to be the sort of person who would do such things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at Lina. "Would you believe me if I told you I learned to sing so that you could keep your eyes on me a little longer when I saw you again?"</p></div>
