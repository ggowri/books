        <h1>Chapter 1373</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only hear her best friend's voice slowly sounding from the other end of the phone. She said word by word, "Grace... I... I'd like to see... Hadwin... Will... Will you get him for me... Help me... contact him... Tell him... I want to see him... I trust him... no matter what happens..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace burst into tears instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not even know how to answer Lina. The Hadwin Stephenson she trusted was now dating another woman. Maybe... the answer was not what Lina was expecting at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's tears made Hadwin Stephenson rush over suddenly. "What happened to Lina? Did something happen to Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sobbed, and before she could speak, Hadwin Stephenson snatched the phone out of her hand and anxiously roared into the other end of the line, "What happened to Lina?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin..." Only one word came from the other end of the line, but it already made Hadwin Stephenson stiffen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's... Lina's voice!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips quivered and moved slightly as if he wanted to say something, but it seemed that all words were stuck in his throat. He could not even utter a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin... I... I want to see you. Whatever... it is, I... just want to hear it... from you... If... you don't come and see me, I... I won't eat or drink and... wait until... you come..." Lina's voice sounded intermittently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's heart immediately sank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew her temper. Sometimes, she liked to coquettishly play dumb and was indecent in her fangirling. It would not be the first time she had lied to him. He had even called her a little liar back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she always kept her word once she made up her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson clutched the phone tightly. 'How can she do this? How can she threaten me with her life? Does what I say matter so much?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After an unknown amount of time, the word &lsquo;okay&rsquo; finally escaped his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the call ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace glared at Hadwin Stephenson and nervously asked, "What did Lina say to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She asked to see me and I said yes." Hadwin Stephenson restrained the expression on his face and threw the phone back to Grace. "Which hospital is she in? I'll go over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you going to tell her once you're there?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll tell her what I need to say, of course," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And what do you need to say?" Grace asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stared coldly at Grace, saying, "That's between me and her. You have no right to ask. If you won't give me the name of the hospital, I'll look it up myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait!" Grace reached out her hand to grab Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson suddenly shook his hand, and Grace was caught off guard. She seemed like she was about to fall, but luckily, Jason grabbed her from the side.</p></div>
