        <h1>Chapter 3167</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, okay, don't say these things in front of your brother Brian anymore. Be careful, he might really get angry!" Auntie Sandy reminded her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi reluctantly kept her mouth shut and didn't say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This paragraph is like a short interlude, and it has passed for now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before dinner, the elderly Mr. and Mrs. Hart formally introduced Valda to the relatives who had come to their home today. In their words, they seemed to already consider Valda as their future daughter-in-law!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The attitude of the old Mr. and Mrs. Hart made it clear to the relatives that Valda's position in the Hart family was secure. Her limp and family background would not subject her to any mistreatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, Valda's relatives became more enthusiastic towards her, and some even voluntarily gave her gifts, including expensive ones, which made Valda feel a bit overwhelmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since it's their goodwill, you should accept it," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda then accepted the gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi felt even more uncomfortable seeing Valda accept the gifts. How could a cripple become Brian's wife?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dinner, Lexi deliberately walked up to Valda and said with a smile, "Valda, I read online that the reason you disappeared was because you saved Grace's child. You have a big heart. Most people wouldn't be able to do that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing," Valda said. Even though the other person was smiling, she could still sense the contempt and unfriendliness in their bones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But since this person was a relative of the Hart family, Valda naturally had to give them some face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what you did will bring you good karma. Grace is the person Brian has been thinking about for many years. By saving Grace's child, Brian naturally has a better impression of you and will want to repay you. You know, there were so many women around Brian before, but he never said he would marry anyone!" Lexi continued to smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the surface, it seemed like Lexi was praising Valda's actions, but in reality, she was implying that Brian only married Valda out of gratitude and that Grace was the one in Brian's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda narrowed her eyes slightly. Indeed, Lexi had ulterior motives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" she replied calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think that's how it is. You're really lucky, even though you had a tough time during the year you were missing, at least you were able to marry into the Hart family! You'll have a good life from now on. It was also good timing that you stumbled upon this situation and made the right choice," said Lexi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda stared straight at Lexi, and her gaze made Lexi feel a bit uneasy, as if Valda had already seen through all of her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, why are you looking at me like that?" said Lexi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing. I understand what you want to say, so you don't have to continue talking," said Valda, wanting to end the boring conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, her words seemed to have provoked Lexi instead, especially with Valda's indifferent expression, which made Lexi feel like a clown jumping around.</p></div>
