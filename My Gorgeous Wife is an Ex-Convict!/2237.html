        <h1>Chapter 2235</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert's face was full of agony. "But... But all of the businesses that were previously cooperating well with the Yu family decided to stop doing business with us all of a sudden. When I asked them, they said I&rsquo;ve offended someone.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, really? You must have offended many people, then, Mr. Lambert," Martin Weiss said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert had no choice but to suffer in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He... He was usually quite arrogant and had offended many people, but he was rich and knew a lot of people in the triads. Therefore, he could easily smooth things over each time there was a problem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he hit a snag with Martin Weiss this time. This was not something his family could settle. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only thought that Kyla was only Martin Weiss's lover. She meant nothing to him despite being pregnant. He merely humiliated Kyla, but Martin Weiss humiliated him back afterward. He got a taste of his own medicine. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought it was the end of the matter, but many of his family's businesses were affected in the following days. It even affected their capital chain, and the bank would not even loan them money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Lamber family would be dead meat if it went on like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that Martin Weiss and his group were about to leave, Mr. Lambert suddenly said, "Mr. Weiss, you don't want the scandal between you and Miss Corbyn to be exposed, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Scandal?" Martin Weiss suddenly stopped and narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla also frowned. Then, she asked her mother to take Nelson into the car first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn worriedly looked at Mr. Lambert. She was about to leave with her grandson at her daughter's cue, but Nelson refused to go. He insisted on staying with Kyla to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, you brought Miss Corbyn to the party today and Miss Corbyn is dressed up so beautifully. But I'm afraid few people know that Miss Corbyn has been to prison..." Mr. Lambert thought he had something on Martin Weiss and deliberately lowered his voice as if he was afraid others might hear him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes turned cold as his thin lips were pressed together into a straight line. His expression turned grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert felt more assured that he had gotten Martin Weiss's weak point when he saw that. Therefore, he spoke with more enthusiasm, "Miss Corbyn got pregnant out of wedlock. The baby is going to be a bastard when they&rsquo;re born. If others find out you have a bastard child and that a woman who has been to prison gave birth to them, it&rsquo;ll probably damage your and the Weiss family's reputation, Mr. Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Nelson heard the word &lsquo;bastard&rsquo;, his young face seemed gloomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because many people would call him a bastard when they called him names.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had no idea what a bastard was when he was little. After he grew up and understood it, he felt the weight of the word more and more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla saw the gloom on her son's face and felt a pang in her heart. She lunged over to her son, gripped his hand with one hand, and said to Mr. Lambert, "You have no right to call my son that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert said, "But people will talk, won't they? Miss Corbyn, you seem smart. Why don't you advise Mr. Weiss not to make a big deal out of this? Otherwise, everyone's going to suffer if I expose this!"</p></div>
