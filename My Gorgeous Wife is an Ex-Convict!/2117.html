        <h1>Chapter 2115</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah... We're married... Married..." mumbled Martin Weiss as he took another swig of wine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He drank one glass after another, while Jason had only taken one or two sips. Finally, Martin Weiss passed out on the couch. However, even though he was drunk, he was still shouting out Kyla's name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace only saw the drunk Martin Weiss when she walked to the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What did he want with you?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"To vent his grievances, I guess. He and Kyla had already received a marriage license, but he probably felt more miserable because of this." Jason looked grimly at Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace also said emotionally, "He and Kyla could have been a happy couple. If he hadn't forced Kyla to kneel to Paisley Daniels, perhaps he and Kyla might not be where they are today. Perhaps... they might&rsquo;ve been able to get back together when he reversed Kyla's case." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, people might be consigned to eternal damnation with only one mistake," Jason murmured when he suddenly turned around and hugged Grace hard. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He held her so hard it was as if he wanted to embed her into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was caught off guard and felt that his hug was much tighter than usual. "What's wrong? Why are you holding me so tightly all of a sudden?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason muttered, "Because I think I'm really lucky. I'm glad you were willing to forgive me and even... continue to love me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze. Then, she understood that he was reacting this way because Martin Weiss had reminded him of their past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's because you deserve my love." Grace's hands gently hugged Jason back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His body quivered a little. He gently used his face to rub her neck as if he had an endless longing for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was quite used to his occasional bursts of affection. It was as if a huge puppy was asking for a hug. "Alright, stop overthinking. Martin Weiss and Kyla have their own future, while we're only going be together in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As she spoke, Grace reached over her shoulder and stroked his head with her fingers as if she was comforting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We&rsquo;ll never be apart again," said Jason as he suddenly straightened up and carried Grace in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Huh?" She was shocked, but he was already carrying her toward the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss is still passed out on the couch.&rdquo; Grace reminded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Someone will take him to the guest room to rest," said Jason, his beautiful peach blossom eyes full of deep desires and longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace instantly blushed. Even her neck that was exposed outside her pajamas seemed tinged with pink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay... Well, it's late. Why don't... we... uh... go to bed right away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? You don't want it?" Jason carried Grace back to their room and gently placed her on the large bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Not... Not really." Grace blushed even more as his long fingers were already unbuttoning her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes kept staring at her as if he wanted to engulf her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does he not know how enticing he is right now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; It's late now. I'm afraid I won't be able to get up tomorrow morning. I have to take Mick and the rest to kindergarten at seven o'clock," Grace said reluctantly as she resisted the temptation.</p></div>
