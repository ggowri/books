        <h1>Chapter 3047</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda took a deep breath and quickly stepped forward, grabbing Brian's hand. "What are you doing?!" she exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The knuckles of the hand that hit the wall are now red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's me, all my fault! It's because of me that Jasmine was taken away!" Brian murmured, his phoenix eyes filled with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, don't think like that. It's because they have malicious intentions that they would do something like this!" Valda said urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could I not think this way! If I didn't love Grace, how could they possibly target Grace's child? It's because I didn't handle their affairs properly in the first place, that's why Grace is now suffering and Jasmine is in pain. It's me, everything is my fault!" Brian said hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's heart felt a sharp pain, he loved Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He is very aware of this, and Phoebe and Whitney are also very aware of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, are they trying to get revenge on Brian by choosing to kidnap Grace's little daughter?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She has been ignoring the fact that Brian loves Grace, but this event is now mocking her ignorance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, Brian, Grace, and Jason are feeling more pain than Valda's own pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially Brian, who loves Grace so much. Now that Grace has gone through so much trouble to give birth to their child, only to have the baby taken away secretly because of his connection, his feelings can be imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda held Brian, suppressing her own pain, "It's not your fault. Don't blame yourself for everything, just like you told me when my parents died, it wasn't my fault, it's the same thing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian leaned on Valda's shoulder, like a tired person who had almost lost his strength, needing to rely on the woman in front of him to continue struggling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But, Valda... if... if something really happens to Jasmine, I won't be able to forgive myself." Brian murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's hand gently stroked his back, "It won't happen. Jasmine will be fine. Whitney and Phoebe probably have other motives, maybe they will demand a ransom or something. After all, if they took such a big risk and didn't get any benefit, they would be foolish, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda analyzed, "Moreover, with the police and the Reed family and the Barlow family's people, it shouldn't be difficult to find them in Deer Capital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But if something happens to Jasmine..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jasmine won't have any accidents. If they want to benefit, they won't let anything happen to Jasmine. If something happens to Jasmine, they won't benefit, right?" Valda comforted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although sometimes she herself was unsure, now she could only desperately say everything positively. Otherwise, she was afraid that the man in her arms would really collapse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Brian asked in a hoarse voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really, Brian, believe me or not, my intuition is very accurate. My intuition is telling me that Jasmine will be fine!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He slowly lifted his head and looked at her with his dark phoenix eyes. But at this moment, his eyes seemed to be covered with a layer of mist, almost being overwhelmed by pain, self-blame, and guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Believe me, Jasmine will be fine!" Valda reiterated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her blankly, always thinking that he was much stronger than her and that he was the one she relied on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But at this moment, he realized that she was the truly strong one, and that she had become his support!</p></div>
