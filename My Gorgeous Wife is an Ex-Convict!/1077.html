        <h1>Chapter 1076</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, is it true that I can only do what you want? I can't have my own ideas or concerns, nor make you angry? You keep saying you love me, but have you ever respected me?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He paused what he was doing and looked up at her. It seemed as if all the emotions in his eyes had faded, and all that was left was darkness. After a long pause, he finally said, "Do you want me to respect you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A cold voice rang in the room with a sense of cold loneliness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She laughed at herself. "I'm being stupid. You wouldn't be keeping me here if you respected me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can respect you and satisfy everything you want. I'll do whatever you want as long as you can love me and stop thinking about other men," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had put himself in an inferior position by making such a statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace only said lightly, "You're only respecting me on the premise that I love you, and if I don't, you'll control my will, preference, and longing, won't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips were pressed into a straight line, and his eyes were dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She met his eyes without fear or retreat&hellip; Perhaps, she had retreated enough and did not want to retreat anymore. "Jason, if this is all your respect is, then I don't need it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? You don't need it..." he muttered, suddenly picking her up and moving toward the bed nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She struggled immediately. "What are you trying to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you just say you don't need my respect and I don't have to respect you?" As he spoke, he threw her onto the bed and tore his collar open with his long fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression was calm and even his tone was light, but the way he acted scared her. He almost had his way with her in this very room the night she was brought there!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost instinctively, she struggled to get up to get away from the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his arms were wrapped around her waist again as he pressed her hard against the bed before her feet even touched the ground. "Looks like I&rsquo;ve respected you too much that you don't know what disrespect is!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kissed her on the lips as he spoke. It was an almost suffocating kiss that seemed to swallow her whole.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace struggled as hard as she could but it was to no avail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she tried to bite, he seemed to sense it and his fingers immediately grabbed her jaw as well as the sides of her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not move her jaw and could only accept his kiss passively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He subdued her struggle and resistance. The sheer power frightened her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As his kiss went lower and lower, she trembled almost uncontrollably while tears gushed out inadvertently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Beads of tears fell down her cheeks, and he could taste something salty on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly paused and pulled himself up slowly only to see her face that was full of tears and her slender body that was trembling.</p></div>
