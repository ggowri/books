        <h1>Chapter 2395</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The name was a pain to him every time he thought of it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you betray me? Why... did you have to fall in love with Herman? Amber Mitchell... You've lost your mind, but you lost it for Herman. You... brought all this upon yourself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, she brought it upon herself. Therefore, I don't have to feel guilty even if she&rsquo;s miserable!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory told himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? He went over and met Amber Mitchell?" Louise Mitchell's expression changed after she received the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George had never visited Amber Mitchell over the years, but he unexpectedly went to the hospital today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why would George go there?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's mind suddenly flashed back to Amber Mitchell's so-called former friend she had met there a few days ago. 'Does this have anything to do with the people I saw that day?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'After George met Amber Mitchell, will he&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A sudden fear rose in Louise Mitchell's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had witnessed how much George loved Amber Mitchell back then. Back then, George had ignored her no matter how much she loved him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it had not been for what had happened between Amber Mitchell and Herman Moss... Amber Mitchell would probably have inherited the Mitchell family and become Mrs. Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell would probably still be the Mitchell family's second heiress whom people ignored!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not give Amber Mitchell any chance to change her fate. Amber Mitchell was going to spend the rest of her life in the mental hospital like a lunatic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When George Gregory returned, Louise Mitchell hurried up to him and said, "George, you're back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory stared at the smiling face in front of him. However, what flashed across his mind was Amber Mitchell's face covered with frizzy hair and her eyes full of hatred. "How did Amber Mitchell lose her right ring finger?" he asked sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's smile froze, and she said awkwardly, "Why... are you suddenly asking me that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How on earth did she lose her finger?" He demanded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was an accident. She had a conflict with another patient in the hospital. They had somehow hidden a knife and cut off her ring finger. Her finger was lost in the chaos, so we missed the best time to connect it," replied Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When did this happen? Why didn't you tell me?" George Gregory asked. He had to learn about it from an outsider.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It happened not long after she was admitted to the hospital. As for why I didn't tell you..." Louise Mitchell bit her lip slightly. "You told me not to tell you anything about Sis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory paused. He had indeed said that, but... it never occurred to him that Amber Mitchell would lose a finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell said, "George, it happened so many years ago. Don't think about it anymore. Sis is now a patient. Let her be treated in the hospital without worrying about her. I made some snacks today. Try them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She grabbed George Gregory's hand as she spoke, trying to lead him to the dining room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory did not move but looked down at Louise Mitchell's well-maintained hands. "Without a worry? How can you say that when you&rsquo;re letting her be beaten and kicked in the hospital?&rdquo;</p></div>
