        <h1>Chapter 2934</h1>
        <div><p>&quot;Did you mistake me for someone else? Did you think I couldn&#x27;t handle it?&quot; Brian Hart raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Valda Theller&#x27;s face turned even redder, quickly changing the subject, &quot;How is your injury? Does it still hurt?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s alright, not too painful,&quot; he replied, looking at her blushing face. He sighed and said, &quot;Also, my mother&#x27;s words earlier, you don&#x27;t have to worry about them.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot; She looked at him in confusion.</p><p>&quot;The breakup, since it was your decision, I respect it. You don&#x27;t need to worry about me taking the blame for it,&quot; he said, even though he wanted to keep her by his side, take care of her, protect her, and even felt that she was the only woman who could pull him out of the emotional quagmire.</p><p>But...he still wanted to respect her decision.</p><p>He didn&#x27;t want to force her, let alone see her tears.</p><p>&quot;Okay, I understand...&quot; Valda Theller said dryly, feeling a heavy weight in her chest.</p><p>Although he was willing to respect her decision, she couldn&#x27;t feel happy at the moment. Instead, she felt a sense of sadness.</p><p>---</p><p>Brian Hart needed to stay in the hospital for two more days, so Valda Theller continued to stay with him.</p><p>Camille Strickland, on the other hand, had woken up and undergone some tests to confirm that there were no problems. She was able to leave the hospital, but before she did, she came to Brian Hart&#x27;s ward.</p><p>She had to express her gratitude to her savior.</p><p>&quot;Thank you, Mr. Hart, for saving me yesterday,&quot; Camille Strickland said.</p><p>&quot;It was Valda Theller who saved you. I just helped her,&quot; Brian Hart said.</p><p>&quot;Well, anyway, both you and Valda Theller are my saviors,&quot; Camille Strickland said. She didn&#x27;t expect that drinking a little alcohol would cause such a big commotion.</p><p>&quot;Oh, by the way, Camille, do you know the woman who approached you at the bar yesterday?&quot; Valda Theller asked.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know her. How could I know that she would do something like that? But didn&#x27;t you say that I was brought out of the bar by that woman? How come there was a man in the hotel room later?&quot; Camille Strickland asked in confusion.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a gang organization that specializes in finding a single woman in a bar and then attacking her. They also take various videos and photos and use them to threaten and extort the victims. Many women have fallen victim to them, but because it involves privacy, these women often don&#x27;t want to report it to the police,&quot; Brian Hart explained.</p><p>&quot;How do you know?&quot; Valda Theller asked in surprise.</p><p>&quot;The police have already received news. I just knew it a little earlier. Miss Strickland, I&#x27;m sure the police will inform you soon,&quot; Brian Hart said.</p><p>Valda Theller didn&#x27;t expect Brian Hart to know the investigation results of the police so quickly while he was still in the hospital.</p><p>After chatting for a while, Camille Strickland said, &quot;I&#x27;ll go back now. Valda Theller, take care of Mr. Hart, and don&#x27;t worry about work. You can take a few days off!&quot;</p><p>As she spoke, she even winked at Valda Theller, making her feel embarrassed.</p><p>After her friend left, Valda Theller looked at Brian Hart and said, &quot;Um...would you like an apple? Let me peel it for you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure, thank you,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s not a bother,&quot; she quickly said, taking an apple from the fruit basket and washing it before slowly peeling it with a small fruit knife.</p><p>However, her peeling skills were limited, and she couldn&#x27;t peel the apple skin continuously. When she finished peeling the apple, it looked a bit ugly.</p><p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t peel it very well,&quot; Valda Theller said awkwardly.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s okay,&quot; he said, taking the apple from her and eating it slowly.</p><p>Valda Theller sat quietly beside him, watching Brian Hart. He seemed to have lost some weight and his complexion was paler than before.</p><p>He said he was willing to get hurt for her. He said she couldn&#x27;t move, but that was a lie.</p><p>How could she not move when a man she loved was hurt for her? How could her heart not be moved?</p><p>But in addition to being touched, there was always a voice reminding her that he truly loved Grace! So she was cautious and didn&#x27;t want to let her emotions run wild.</p><p>If there is a chance in the future, she will definitely repay him for his life-saving kindness.</p></div>
