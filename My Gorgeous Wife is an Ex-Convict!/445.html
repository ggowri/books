        <h1>Chapter 444</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason paused his steps as his black eyes stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was puzzled. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What if I would?&rdquo; he suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was taken aback for a moment as the smile on her face gradually disappeared. With difficulty, she pursed her lips and looked at him solemnly. &ldquo;Jason, I don&rsquo;t like it when someone lies to me. I&rsquo;ve always thought that for a relationship to last, we should be honest with each other. The least is not telling lies to each other.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was silent, but his gaze remained fixed on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Would you lie to me?&rdquo; she asked again. Her heart was feeling anxious and uneasy as if she was afraid that he would say yes. She was afraid that their take on things would be on opposite spectrums.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they could not be on the same page regarding this, how were they going to continue with the relationship?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hands that were by his sides clenched unnoticeably. Then, his lips slowly moved as he uttered out two words, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she heard his answer, she felt as if a boulder had been lifted from her heart. She could finally catch a breather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Fortunately, he won&rsquo;t lie to me.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why? Were you afraid that my answer won&rsquo;t be something you&rsquo;d want to hear?&rdquo; he asked, noticing the relief from her expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;A little.&rdquo; She sheepishly rubbed her nose. &ldquo;Anyway, I won&rsquo;t lie to you about anything, so neither should you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he softly replied to her. &ldquo;However, what would you do if my answer just now was &lsquo;I would&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to know the answer to the other possibility, even if that answer would make him more afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought about it and lightly bit her lip. &ldquo;Perhaps... I&rsquo;ll ask for a breakup.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, if they had different opinions about morals, it was going to be an arduous road for them. She might as well end things earlier before their feelings became deeper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had experienced being cheated on once before, and she did not want to go through it a second time. Back then, Sean said that he loved her and would protect her. When she got into the accident, he even said that he would find the best lawyer for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yet when she was in the detention center, he told her that he wanted to break up with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man who said he loved her simply watched on as others ruined her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He even said that what he regretted most was making her his girlfriend. He forgot how he once professed his love for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What had she lost from that? Was it love? Or was it the trustworthiness toward any human?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If not for Lina, perhaps she would have lost her trust toward mankind completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she said so, he immediately grabbed her and hugged her tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never break up!&rdquo; His clear voice carried a sense of anxiety and certainty. His arms held her so tightly that she nearly lost her breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s face was plastered on Jason&rsquo;s chest. Through his shirt, she could still hear his heartbeat. It was strong yet rapid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying... It&rsquo;s just a hypothesis. It's not happening...&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Not even a hypothesis should exist.&rdquo; He urgently interrupted her words. Her hypothesis made him anxious as if it would turn to reality at any moment. He felt as if even though he was hugging her right now, he could not completely grab on to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Jay... You... You need to let go a little. I can't breathe...&rdquo; Grace could not help from saying.</p></div>
