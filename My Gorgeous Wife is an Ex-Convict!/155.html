        <h1>Chapter 154</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was used to this kind of person. They looked down on sanitation workers, and even if they knocked into one, they would push the blame on them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Forget it, Claire, it's no big deal," Grace said as she and Claire continued sweeping the streets. After knocking off from work, Grace changed out of her uniform. She found a silver bracelet in one of her pockets.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"When did this bracelet get into my pocket?" Grace was puzzled. As she was on the night shift, not many people were around. She put away the bracelet and decided to put it at the Lost and Found Counter the following day.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she got back to the rental apartment, it was dark and quiet.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the past, when she got back from her night shift, the house had been bright because Jason had always been waiting for her. However, when Grace switched on the light, the room was empty. She could not help smiling wryly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she lay in bed, she took out the bracelet. It must have belonged to a child and the design looked ordinary. She recalled that she had had a similar one when she was young.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wondered how the bracelet had ended up in her pocket. Suddenly, she remembered the man who had knocked into her during the day. This bracelet could belong to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, at one glance, she saw that the bracelet looked worthless. She wondered if the man would come back to look for it. Grace let out a sigh and decided not to dwell on it. She would report it to Sanitation Service Center the following day.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was not aware that the man who had knocked into her had been besieged by a group of people in a hotel room. He was beaten up and being interrogated by them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man regretted his actions. He wouldn't have stolen the bracelet from Brian if he had known that he would get into serious trouble. From Brian's outfit, he had reckoned that he was rich. He had thought that he was fortunate to have caught such a big fish.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sir, I have no idea about the bracelet that you mentioned. I... I did see the bracelet and put it in my pocket. I swear that I have no idea why it is not in my pocket anymore!" the man cried as he knelt in front of Brian, his face covered in blood.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian sat gracefully on the sofa, his handsome face looking cold as he said, "Where is the bracelet? You can ask for anything, but you have to return the bracelet to me. If you don't, I will break your hand."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man was scared out of his wits. If he had known that the bracelet was so important, he wouldn't have taken it and put it in his pocket. He had left in a hurry and knocked into someone...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, the man recalled something and said immediately, "I remember it now! Someone must have picked up the bracelet... I... I knocked into a sanitation worker who was sweeping the floor earlier. The bracelet must have dropped out of my pocket and the sanitation worker could have picked it up."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The few men who were holding the man down looked at Brian upon hearing that.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Hart, what should we do...?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Check. Go and find out where the sanitation worker is!" Brian said coldly. The bracelet had been his only consolation all these years and he had to get it back by all means.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was willing to pay any price to get it back!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had a feeling that he would never be able to find the person if he were to lose the bracelet!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, Grace woke up from her sleep. The room was bright as she had kept the lights on.</p></div>
