        <h1>Chapter 572</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Lina followed the assistant to Howell Webb's lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Howell Webb was pretty cordial toward them, offering to take pictures with them. He even said with a smile, "If you want tickets to any of my movies in the future, you can just call me and I'll have them delivered."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he gave Lina his phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Howell Webb's opinion, Young Master Reed had mentioned that Miss Cummins was his girlfriend when Grace came with Jason that day. Naturally, he wanted to get along with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, being in showbiz, the more connections one had, the merrier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was Grace's best friend, and Howell Webb was more than happy to show kindness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Howell Webb had given Lina his phone number in person before this, Lina would have been thrilled. However, at this moment... she merely took it and said a polite thank you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting Howell Webb's autograph and posters, Lina took the initiative to say to Howell Webb, "Sorry for bothering you today. We gotta go now, thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Lina left and dragged Grace with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little surprised. She had thought that Lina would want to stay a bit longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they were out of Howell Webb's lounge, Grace said, "Why did you leave so soon? You couldn&rsquo;t have been shy just because he was near you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" Lina rolled her eyes. What was her friend saying? "I just think I shouldn't have brought you here today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just because of Evelyn?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's clearly trying to set you up by doing such things in front of all those fans. We have no idea what the internet is going to say about you." Lina was often caught up with all kinds of entertainment gossip. Thus, it was only natural for her to think of such things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They can say whatever they want." Grace shrugged. She was long past caring about gossip. Grace used to hope that she left a good impression of herself in the eyes of others. However, she later found out that if she cared too much about other&rsquo;s opinions, she would only end up suffering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had continued to care about what others thought upon getting out of prison, she would have ended up hanging herself with a rope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you ask Jason to help you? If there are really bad rumors on the internet, ask Jason to get someone to shut them down," said Lina. After all, such a thing should not be a problem for Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her best friend's worried look and patted her on the shoulder. "All right, I get it. Don't worry about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, what's your relationship with Brian?" Lina thought of another question. "He seems to... care about you. He even helped you get Evelyn off your back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how she looked at it, Brian seemed to be on Grace's side. However, Brian was Evelyn's boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He just thinks I look a bit like someone he knows. Maybe... he got separated from that person and didn't get to find her. So, he feels a little compensatory when he sees me," said Grace. Her guesses were based on past conversations she had had with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think I've heard of it," Lina thought for a moment before saying, "From the gossip posts I've seen before, someone has said that it seems all the girlfriends Brian has had are just stand-ins. Brian has been trying rather hard to find a woman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina used to think that those netizens were merely spouting nonsense, but it now seemed to be true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While they were talking, they saw Hadwin coming their way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina immediately felt guilty and subconsciously hid behind Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why? You dare say you're working overtime today but you dare not see me?" Hadwin's voice rang coldly.</p></div>
