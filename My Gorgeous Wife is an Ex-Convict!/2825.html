        <h1>Chapter 2823</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wondered how Brian would feel if he learned that she had thoughts about forcing herself on him and being more intimate with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Will he think I'm... lecherous?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh, no!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even with her head down, she could feel his eyes on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she finally finished her meal, she jumped up and said, "I... I'm done. I'm going to rest!" With that said, she was about to run back to her bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had not taken two steps when Brian had already risen. He blocked her way. "Are you avoiding me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" She froze. Blushing, she said in a panic, "No... No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It sounded like a lie and was not very convincing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said in confusion, "It seems you're really avoiding me. Why? Did I do something to upset you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... No! You haven't done anything bad!" she quickly said in denial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then why are you avoiding me?" he asked as he took one step forward. Those dark phoenix eyes stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only felt as if his gaze was enveloping her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm not avoiding you." She looked down to avoid his eyes and stuck to her original answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned slightly, raised his hand to grab Valda Theller's chin, and forced her to look up at him. "If I've done something to upset you, you might as well just tell me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller felt herself burning. Valda Theller knew her face was red as hell without looking in the mirror. 'Just tell him... How can I just tell him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I going to tell him that I'm turned on by his good looks?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, I thought we were a couple. You can tell me anything. I can change if it's my problem," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Outsiders would probably be shocked to hear that. 'When would the crown prince ever say something like that to others?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There... There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the problem," stammered Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have a problem? What problem?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip and said nothing. It was embarrassing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he seemed hell-bent on pursuing the matter. "You can tell me any problem you have. Maybe I can help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt as if her blood were about to burst. She was already in such a state. His words were like adding fuel to the fire!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmm?" He was still waiting for her answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller made up her mind, closed her eyes, and said, "I... I want to force myself on you. I wanna kiss you and hug you, so... don't... Don't get too close to me. I... I don't know what I&rsquo;ll do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to be a nuisance to him, but if he got close to her, she might be tempted to do something he hated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The air was filled with awkwardness after she yelled that out. </p></div>
