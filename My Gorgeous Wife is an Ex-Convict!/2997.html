        <h1>Chapter 2995</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When I arrived at the room of the manga club, it was a very large room, but it was shared by several clubs, and the manga club occupied one corner of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, there are several students busy at the comic club.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And when Zoran Yeats introduced Valda, those students immediately looked at her with eyes full of surprise and excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Obviously, Valda, who has become a manga artist, has become an idol in the hearts of the manga club students.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, why don't you draw us a picture on the spot?" a student suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes! Valda, you rarely come here, so drawing a picture would be a commemoration for our comic club!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll draw one," Valda generously agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A classmate brought paper and pens, Valda sat down and began to draw on the paper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Zoran Yeats answered a phone call and said to Valda, "Valda, I need to go to the academic affairs office. You stay here and keep drawing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Zoran Yeats left, Valda received a call from Brian. Brian said, "I'm done with my business and on my way to your school. Where are you now? I'll come find you in a bit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm in the comic club. You can come to the third floor of building 5," Valda said, putting away her phone and continuing to draw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A curious female student asked, "Valda, who's coming to find you later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My boyfriend," Valda smiled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wow, Valda's boyfriend, I really want to meet him!" The girls from the comic club chattered excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The boys, on the other hand, seem to be better in comparison, as they don't show too much curiosity on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at these younger students in front of her, Valda began to reminisce about her own high school days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She lowered her head and continued drawing. It didn't take long before she finished the outline of the painting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the scene, a boy under the moonlight is playing a flute, while a pure and graceful girl is sitting on a tree branch. The picture is beautiful and heartwarming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Great, it's no wonder it's at a professional level!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wish I could draw as well as this someday!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, is it difficult to become a manga artist?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The group of people from the comic book company began to ask Valda various questions about the comic book industry, and Valda patiently answered them while also giving them encouragement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like back then when Mr. Yeats encouraged her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, a voice suddenly sounded, "Hey, you're Valda, right? You came today too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked up and saw two women walking in. She recognized them from their appearance as her classmates from high school, Linda and Taylah.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello," Valda politely greeted them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In high school, her relationship with Linda and Taylah was not good. Although they didn't have any conflicts, Valda knew that these two had often mocked her behind her back for being a dependent and poor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You seem quite popular," Linda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know Valda? She's the shining star of our manga club! She's a famous manga artist who has already published many works!" A younger student said admiringly.</p></div>
