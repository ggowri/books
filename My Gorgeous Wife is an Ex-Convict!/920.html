        <h1>Chapter 919</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eye darkened immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Contradict each other... Yeah, they do contradict each other!' He was afraid that he would love her too much that he would one day repeat his father's mistake of losing his dignity and life for love. He could not let her control his emotions!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after breaking up with her, he could not help wanting to see her and ended up forcing her to stay by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know what? The only person in the world who can make me contradict myself is you!" His thin lips parted as he stared at her intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned as she stared at Jason in confusion. 'What does he mean by that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way he looked at her seemed to be a combination of extreme desire and restraint. It was extremely contradictory!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day when Grace got off work and was walking out of the building, the Reed family's driver came up to her. "Mr. Reed wants to see you, Miss Cummins."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips together before following the driver into the car without a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz once again caught sight of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Still the same Maybach.' Andrea Schwartz was delighted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It looks like something is going on between Grace and Curtis Row after all! I remember hearing that Curtis Row's current girlfriend is a starlet. If that starlet finds out about it&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, a smile flashed across Andrea Schwartz's mouth. She took out her phone and secretly filmed Grace getting into the car as well as the car speeding off a moment later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of this was evidence. If she got more evidence and posted it online, it would be enough to make the starlet come and pick a fight with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That starlet was famous for quarreling with people. She got famous and attracted a lot of attention because of that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace would be screwed if the starlet picked a fight with her. The more Andrea Schwartz thought about it, the more pleased she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace arrived at Reed Residence, the butler only said, "Mr. Reed's home. He asked you to look for him in the bedroom when you've arrived, Miss Cummins."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt somewhat awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word &lsquo;bedroom&rsquo; was enough to make one&rsquo;s imagination run wild! Especially when everyone here knew about her past relationship with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not escape even if she wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like she had become an actress who could only follow Jason's script. The ending of this play was completely up to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to Jason's bedroom door where she knocked twice, but no one answered. There was no one in the room when she pushed the door open. Even the lights were off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he not in his bedroom?' As she thought about this, she found that the door that linked the two bedrooms was open. The bedroom next door was the one she used to stay in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lights in that bedroom were on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but lift her feet and walk toward the next room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The room remained exactly as it had been when she left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even the skincare products she used were sitting on the dresser just the way they were before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she still could not find Jason in this room. Just as she was about to go downstairs and ask the butler, the bathroom door was suddenly pulled open.</p></div>
