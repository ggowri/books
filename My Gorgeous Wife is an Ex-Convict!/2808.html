        <h1>Chapter 2806</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides..." She paused. "They took all the money for my parents&rsquo; death and even a lot of my parents&rsquo; inheritance. They're not that poor. They're just... too greedy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to feed their greed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, enough about that." Valda Theller pulled herself together and took a deep breath. "I have to continue drawing storyboards. I&rsquo;ll have to burn the midnight oil today if I don't finish them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said and returned to her work desk to work on her storyboards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian watched Valda Theller in silence and could not help falling into a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time Valda Theller finished drawing the storyboards, it was already past six o&rsquo;clock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry, I lost track of time," she quickly apologized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you done?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's get dinner, then. What do you want?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about the small restaurant near the studio? The same restaurant we ran into each other the second time," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes twinkled. The restaurant was the small noodle shop where Grace used to work at, and it carried many memories of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you suddenly want to eat there?" he asked calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe because that's where we became a couple, so I find it... familiar," she said. She did not say that she often went alone when working at the studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every time she sat there eating, she would think of their fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had not walked into the small restaurant that day, maybe she and he would have never met again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, she met him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pondered for a moment before saying, "Okay, let's eat there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The small restaurant was not far from her studio, so the two walked there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They ordered after entering the small restaurant. Though their relationship had gone viral online, Brian was not a celebrity even though he was the crown prince of the entertainment industry. No one recognized him in the small restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, people still look sideways from time to time due to his outfit and temperament.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The restaurant served the food after a while. Valda Theller lowered her head to eat. After a moment's hesitation, she asked, "Are you free next Wednesday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian asked, "What's up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The company had an important movie contract to sign next Wednesday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip. "Next Wednesday is my parents' death anniversary. If... Can you accompany me to pay them my respects if you're free? I... I want to introduce my boyfriend to my parents."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted her parents to know she was no longer alone and finally had someone. Even if... she had no idea how long he would be there for her, at least she was now happy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was silent.</p></div>
