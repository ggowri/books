        <h1>Chapter 666</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if the bad guys catch you too?" It was a little boy's voice, but she could not see his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, they won't!" the little girl retorted at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little boy just looked at her thoughtfully without speaking a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, the little girl muttered, "If I get caught too, at&hellip; At least we can keep each other company. I'm not afraid!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little girl held the little boy by the hand tightly. The pair of silver bracelets on her slim, fair wrist were particularly conspicuous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little girl and the little boy ran on the rugged hill road. The little boy was usually well-pampered. Even if he had great motor skills, he had never experienced a situation like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little girl led the way while tightly holding hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the boy slipped and began to fall down the hill. Due to inertia, the girl followed suit until her body was stuck in a small branch that grew out of the side of the hill. That stopped them from falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little girl's left hand was still holding the boy's hand tightly. The boy's feet desperately wanted to step on the hillside so that his body did not have to hang in the air, but the slope was so steep that his feet could hardly stand on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A look of fear came over the boy's face, then the fear grew stronger and stronger as he feared that the little girl holding his hand would abandon him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she let go, she could easily climb back up the hill, while he would fall to the bottom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Being born in the Hart familyHart family, he had received elite education since childhood, and his father had never been afraid to tell him the dark side of human nature. Therefore, he knew that many people would sacrifice the lives of others for their own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, he and she were strangers to each other. Even if she wanted to let go of his hand and abandon him, it was only... Normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that he was scared. He was really scared. He was scared that she would throw him off the hill. He did not want to die. He was afraid he was going to die like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, you..." the little girl said with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little boy looked up with fear in his eyes. Looking at the little girl, he felt as though his whole body was turning cold. Would&hellip; Would she let go of his hand? Would she just throw him off like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hold on to my hand, or you'll fall!" a childish voice said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The voice was like a voice from heaven, flooding into the little boy's ears. The little girl's face was now red as she tried her best. The way bean-sized beads of sweat rolled down her cheeks was branded into the little boy's heart like an imprint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hurry&hellip; Hurry up. Hold on to me and don't let go. I&hellip; I'll take you up..." The little girl struggled to say as she moved with all her might, step by step toward the safety of the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little boy stared at the little girl, knowing that if she took him with her, she would probably fall off the hill too...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why&rsquo;s that? Why is she insisting on helping me? Why is she insisting on saving me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I... Don&rsquo;t even know her name!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's&hellip; What's your name? You can call me Bryn. My family calls me Bryn..." the little boy said in a mutter, suddenly wanting to know her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, suddenly a protruding stone on which his foot had struggled to step on gave way, and at once, he slid downward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" The little boy's scream was accompanied by the little girl's cry for &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Bryn!" Grace suddenly opened her eyes and bounced out of bed. She felt as if she was drenched in a cold sweat. Her back and palms were covered with sweat.</p></div>
