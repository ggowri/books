        <h1>Chapter 2256</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla nodded, and the three finally reached the school cafeteria. Martin Weiss and Nelson went to the counter to buy some food and drinks, while Kyla found a seat and waited for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes welled up as she watched the father and son hold a plate each while choosing the food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This scene was common for ordinary families.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was so rare for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She once thought Martin Weiss and Nelson would never get along like normal father and son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what happened today had surprised her. Perhaps it was exactly because they were father and son. They were tied by blood, after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What about me... How much affection do I have left for Martin Weiss?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If there's really nothing left, why did I feel some discomfort in my chest when I heard Martin Weiss had been getting his blood drawn for me? Is it just because I don't want to owe Martin Weiss anything?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought that the best thing that could happen to her was to raise her children, take good care of her mother until she passed, and spend the rest of her life in peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace told her to live for herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Live for myself... How am I supposed to do that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla fell into a trance for a moment. When Martin Weiss and Nelson Corbyn came over holding food and drinks, Kyla still had not snapped out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's come over you? Are you okay?" Martin Weiss asked worriedly, while Nelson Corbyn could not help tugging at his mother's sleeve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla finally snapped out of her trance and looked at the two worried faces. She, quickly said, "Nothing. I was just thinking about restocking the store." She made up an excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're worried about no one being there to restock the store, I can help you with it," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would have been a surprise to others if they heard this. The head of a corporation wanted to restock a store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. Chase will help me deliver the goods," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was familiar with the stalls she usually restocked from. They would help her pack up her goods, and Chase would help her deliver them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Chase Harper?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla replied, "Yes. Chase's shop is at the marketplace too. He said he'll deliver my goods to the store for me after he closes for the day today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to bother Chase, but he insisted, so it was hard to refuse him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would remember his kindness and repay him in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes sparkled slightly but he said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the parent-child event was over, Martin Weiss accompanied Kyla and Nelson back to the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn took Nelson to the room at the back. Only Kyla and Martin Weiss were left in the store.</p></div>
