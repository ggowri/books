        <h1>Chapter 2203</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His and Kyla's blood types were rare, so the hospital kept very few bags of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had no idea how risky Kyla's pregnancy would be this time around, so this was all he could do for now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Blood and liver were all he could give her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay. We understand, Mr. Weiss," the doctor answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they finished drawing a bag of 400ml blood, the doctor and nurse left the ward. Martin Weiss slowly closed his eyes. What flickered in his head was the look of utter disgust in Kyla's eyes on the operating table that day. She looked at him as if he had sullied her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would they have gotten back together if he had not done that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, her attitude toward him had gradually softened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... he would not have known how determined she was to give birth to the baby if he had not done it that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He always screwed up everything between them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why did he keep doing that? He had done it back then, and it was the same again this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was time for Kyla to go for her pregnancy check-up again. After her son went to school that morning, she took her bag to head to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she saw Martin Weiss's car parked at the store&rsquo;s entrance as soon as she left the store. Martin Weiss was standing beside the car as if waiting for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked away as if she had not seen Martin Weiss and intended to bypass him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss quickly ran forward, grabbed Kyla's arm, and said, "Let me send you to the hospital. You have your pregnancy check-up today. I'm just taking you there. I won't do anything else!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla tried hard to withdraw her arm but failed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "Martin Weiss, let go! I made it clear the other day that it's over between us. It's really over. I beg you to spare me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pain and helplessness flashed across Martin Weiss's face. "I... I just want to drop you off in case something happens to you on the way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla suddenly smiled bitterly. "In case something happens to me? Aren't you the worst that can happen to me? Do you think I'd dare ride in your car again? The last time I took your car, you had someone press me against the operating table. What about in the future? Are you going to take me to that place again and tell me what to do? I'm a human being, yet I can't even control my own body and have to do whatever you tell me to do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every word she uttered was like a stab with the sharpest sword.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was already riddled with holes when she was done talking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't do anything to you again. It won't happen again. Will... Will you trust me?" He begged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled even more sarcastically. "How can I trust you? What's more..." She paused, and her eyes fell on the arm he was grabbing. "The way the body reacts can't fool anyone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He froze, finally noticing that her arm was trembling.</p></div>
