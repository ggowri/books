        <h1>Chapter 1008</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why... Why don't I just wait in his office?" asked Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm afraid that's inappropriate. It's best if you wait outside, Miss Lindsay," said the secretary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella gritted her teeth and sat down on the couch outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only felt that the secretary was treating her differently today. Although she seemed respectful and even offered her a cup of coffee when she sat down, she was no longer fawning over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because... Brian has openly stated that we're not a couple in the interview?' Stella's heart was filled with rage at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to Brian's statement, she got all sorts of taunts from her coursemates in university, not to mention the snobs in the cast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A lot of people fawned over her because of Brian, and now it was like she had been knocked back into shape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Stella saw a senior executive getting out of the elevator. He approached the secretary and asked, "President Hart hasn't come back yet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I heard that President Hart went to the legal department with someone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, he went to the legal department. Word got around on our side. We've been talking about whether that woman is the one President Hart said he's in love with in the interview. After all, when have you ever seen President Hart accompanying a woman to the legal department?" He gossiped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who is she?" The secretary was curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard that she's a paralegal at some firm. I'm not quite sure about the details."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It must be Grace!' Stella had already come to a conclusion in mind as she listened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian is obsessed with Grace. No, I can't let this go on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Brian starts dating Grace, I won't even have a place beside Brian!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a bit surprised to find herself stopped by Stella as soon as she left Hart Group's building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, what a coincidence running into you here," Stella said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Coincidence?' Grace raised her eyebrows. She did not think it was a coincidence to see her cousin as soon as she left the building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can I help you?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing serious. Since we&rsquo;ve run into each other, why don't we find a place to sit down and talk?" invited Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I'm working right now and have to hurry back to the office. I gotta go if you have nothing else to say." Grace rejected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait!" Stella hastily exclaimed. "Well... I... I also wanted to ask you what's going on between you and Brian..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her knowingly. 'That's probably the real reason why she stopped me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That seems to be personal," said Grace. In other words, she had nothing to tell her.</p></div>
