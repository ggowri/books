        <h1>Chapter 652</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at Brian and Stella Lindsay, his eyes glistening a little. Then, with a slight smile on his lips, he put a hand over Grace's shoulder and said to Brian, "I didn't expect to see you here, Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned his gaze to Jason. "I haven't seen you in days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt, who was about to complain to her daughter about her grievances, was astounded by this. Then, she asked dumbfoundedly, "Do you know each other?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Brian looked at Jason thoughtfully. "Don't they know who you are?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason answered, "I don't think so. I'm not as high-profile as you are, but I'm kind of curious. Why are you here and..." He glanced at Stella Lindsay who was standing next to Brian. "With this woman? When they said this woman had a powerful man as a backup, they probably meant you." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had a mixed expression as he glanced back at Grace who was in a wedding dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He began to feel a pang in his heart again as if it was telling him that everything he believed was just a fantasy. It was all like a dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How much did he wish she was the one?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... As he traced her past, he discovered another fact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stella is the one I've been looking for," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned at this. Of course, she understood what Brian said. Once, Brian had mistaken her for somebody else and even cried in front of her. She could see how persistent he was in finding that person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stella... Is the one he has been looking for? The little girl from his childhood?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt that it was a small world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Congratulations," Jason said with a chuckle, but the look in his eyes when they landed on Stella Lindsay was clearly contemptuous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, the greed of the human heart. She insisted that it was her when she was clearly not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All he did to the evidence was to make them point out that Stella Lindsay was the one Brian was looking for. However, if Stella Lindsay had spoken honestly when Brian found her, Brian would not have misunderstood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was clear that the woman had taken advantage of that identity and claimed it as herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, this was the outcome he wanted to see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay felt uncomfortable being looked at like this by Jason. It was as if he could see through it all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, the man doesn't know anything at all! What can he see through?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay comforted herself in her heart and asked Brian, "Brian, who is he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's Jason," Brian said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the words &lsquo;Jason&rsquo; were spoken, Grace's relatives were stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if they only lived in a small town, they had heard of the name Jason&mdash;He was the man who ruled Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person who was the most shocked was Stella Lindsay!</p></div>
