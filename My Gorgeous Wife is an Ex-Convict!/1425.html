        <h1>Chapter 1424</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if he was afraid of something!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What is he afraid of?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it because of Harold Atkinson? What Harold Atkinson said last was...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace suddenly seemed to have realized something and said, "Jay, are you... scared that I'll be angry?" she guessed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His body stiffened suddenly, and his breathing became rapid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he did not answer her, and his arms closed a little tighter around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace instantly knew she was right. It seemed to be because of what Harold Atkinson had said at the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, Jay&rsquo;s reaction to what Harold Atkinson had said earlier... The rage and murderous look in his eyes had been frightening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if Harold Atkinson... had said something that crossed his bottom line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't worry, I won't be mad!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's lips trembled, and even his voice quivered as he spoke, "You won't... get mad?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, I won't." She smiled and lifted her hands to hold his face. "Harold Atkinson probably came to look for you because of Atkinson Garden today. I know you want to get justice for what happened to me back then, so you can rest assured that what he said won't affect our relationship."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He looked at her blankly. "Do you really not care about his words at all?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You didn't know me back then, did you? It didn't matter to you back then because I was only someone who had killed your fianc&eacute;e. Those people only made it difficult for me in prison to please you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her eyes looked at him calmly, and her fingers touched the outer corners of his eyes. "Jay, I had already let this matter go when I started dating you and then fell in love with you. Didn't you tell me that you wouldn't have let me suffer if you had known me earlier?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyelashes fluttered, and there was a complicated glint in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Does she think this is the only fear I have? She thinks that was the only time I stood on the sidelines and watched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But what I'm afraid of is... when she learns about the truth of her imprisonment!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright. See, I don't care about it anymore. You don't have to either," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You really don't care about it?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If... she could still say so when she found out about everything someday, how wonderful would that be?' His eyelashes lowered gently while his cheek brushed against her palm. <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>"If only I had met you earlier and fallen in love with you earlier, how wonderful would that have been?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then everything else would probably have been different too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Let's talk to each other about everything from now on, okay? Jay, I don't want us to be like Kyla and Martin Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together. "Did you see Martin Weiss again today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Yeah, I met him when I went to see Kyla, so I took him to meet the doctor who performed the so-called miscarriage operation on Paisley Daniels. Martin Weiss's reaction... It was just like what you said. He&rsquo;s indeed in love with Kyla. But because he&rsquo;s still in love with her, the truth hit him all the harder."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a pause, Grace said, "If he had been willing to confront his feelings after falling in love with Kyla and talk to Kyla about their elders&rsquo; feud, they might not have arrived at this point.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But maybe it's best to keep some things hidden and keep the other party in the dark forever," muttered Jason.</p></div>
