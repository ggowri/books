        <h1>Chapter 1172</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she woke up this morning, she realized that she was still on the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin... had never hung up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She then tentatively made some noise, and he immediately said good morning to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice had sounded a little hoarse. She wondered if he had slept well after all the commotion she made the night before, or... did he not sleep at all?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, it had only been two weeks since he left Emerald City, but she missed him so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She desperately wanted to see him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One would know what one wanted after experiencing the fine line between life and death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina stepped out of the subway station and walked to the gate of her neighborhood, her steps stopped short.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A black car had stopped not far away, and a figure got out to walk toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's eyes instantly reddened, and her nose felt so sore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, I'm back," the slightly husky baritone voice said. He looked at her with a gentle but worried look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina suddenly cried out and jumped into Hadwin Stephenson's arms, crying loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her arms were tightly wrapped around him and her face was buried in his arms as she cried loudly. It was as if she was crying out... all her fear, dread, and longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson lowered his head and seemed to be caressing Lina's black hair helplessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her tears made him nervous and broke his heart! Last night, hearing her cry on the phone had already made him feel upset and guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She encountered all these because he had failed to protect her! If anything had happened to her, he would never have forgiven himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even... The more he imagined the scene, the more panicked he became. After that panic came fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw her crying like this in front of him, he did not even know what he could do to make her stop crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would be calm when facing the bloodshed in the Stephenson family and others' conspiracy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her tears flustered him, and all he could do was mumble, "Don't cry... Lina, don't..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It took Lina a while to finally stop crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she looked up at Hadwin Stephenson, her eyes were red and swollen. Those round eyes were soaked with a layer of tears. "Hadwin Stephenson, I miss you so much. Do you know how... How afraid I was yesterday? I was so afraid that I'd never see you again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sobbed, and her voice croaked as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know," he said. His voice was so gentle that it seemed like water would drip from it. "Because I was just as afraid. I was afraid I'd never see you again. Fortunately, you're safe."</p></div>
