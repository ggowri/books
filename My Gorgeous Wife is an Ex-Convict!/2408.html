        <h1>Chapter 2406</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera immediately agreed and called her husband.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">About 15 minutes later, Daley Moss arrived at the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when they talked about the script, Daley Moss glanced at Grace with unease, not wanting her to hear what they were going to talk about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My friend knows Miss Mitchell, so she wants to know what happened between Miss Mitchell and Mr. Herman Moss," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss looked at Grace's eyes meaningfully before smiling suddenly. "It seems you just want to know what had happened between my eldest brother and Amber Mitchell since the start, Mr. Hart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled lightly and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss was a smart man. Brian knew that it would be better for the Moss family if he said all he had to say. Otherwise, more things would be involved if others found out about it. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell and my eldest brother were only friends. In other words, my eldest brother loved Amber Mitchell, but she only thought of him as a friend. She loved George Gregory, which my eldest brother told me before his accident. If it hadn't been for the accident, my brother would have left Deer City and gone abroad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Was Amber Mitchell sent to the mental hospital because she was mentally ill?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I don't know about that," said Daley Moss, but there was a slight glint in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Moss, I think you might as well tell the truth. The conversation we have today will be kept private," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell seemed normal at least in the week before she was admitted to the hospital. Amber Mitchell came to my eldest brother's funeral, but my parents were too agitated that they kept chasing her out. I spoke to her before she left. She felt bad and was sorry about my brother&rsquo;s death. She had a clear mind and was sane," said Daley Moss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But there&rsquo;s a rumor that Amber Mitchell was mentally ill because of your eldest brother's death," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's why the Moss family doesn't want anyone to talk about Amber Mitchell again. We want our eldest brother to have peace after his death. I hope the matter will end there," said Daley Moss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I don't think your brother will be at peace if he knows that the woman he loved and had given his life to protect was admitted to a mental hospital after his death," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss glared at Grace with a cold expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace met his eyes without turning away. "Mr. Moss, I heard you love your wife very much. Bear with me for using an inappropriate metaphor. If you died before your wife one day but someone else sent your wife to a mental hospital to steal your family fortune, would you be able to rest in peace? Perhaps you'll feel pain and regret for not being able to protect your loved one!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss's expression changed slightly, but his voice remained cold. "Anyway, this is the Mitchell family's business. It has nothing to do with the Moss family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It has nothing to do with the Moss family, but I think your brother would want the woman he loved so deeply to be safe and happy,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss looked closely at Grace. "I wonder what you have to do with Amber Mitchell, Miss Cummins? You're very concerned about her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's a friend of a friend, and I want to do whatever I can to help Amber Mitchell after learning about her past," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I want you to stay out of it, Miss Cummins? You can put forward any conditions you have," said Daley Moss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled lightly and shook her head to make it clear that she was not giving up on Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss's eyes darkened with a flicker of danger on his face.</p></div>
