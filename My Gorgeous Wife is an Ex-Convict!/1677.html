        <h1>Chapter 1675</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Zoe Stevens's hair was not as well-groomed as it used to be. It seemed a little frizzy, and she had just tied it loosely with a scrunchie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Stevens siblings stopped pulling when they saw the car approaching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stepped out of the car and looked at the two in front of her. "What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Zoe Stevens immediately rushed over and told Grace, "Grace, my brother saved your life yet you only paid for his medical bills without even thanking him. Is this how you treat your savior?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean used his uninjured hand and quickly pulled Zoe Stevens back, saying, "I was the one who told her I don&rsquo;t need anything else. Enough, Zoe. Let's go home!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Brother, the family needs money. You injured your hand and can't work for more than a month. Don't we need money for Mom's regular visits to the doctor? I won't be able to pay the rent next month with the money I make!" babbled Zoe Stevens.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Embarrassment flashed through Sean's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "So you came for money?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So what if we did? Do you think your life is worth nothing?" Zoe Stevens raised her chin and looked at Grace with jealousy flashing through her eyes. The person she once despised was now the mistress of the Reed family. She lived in a luxurious mansion while she had become an ugly duckling, living just like Grace when she was released from prison!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She used to mock Grace for being a sanitation service worker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now, she was just a dishwasher in a restaurant. Due to her crippled leg, she could not even be a waitress!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, I can give you money," said Grace. It would be nice to use money to settle this. At least, she and Sean could settle everything between them. "How much do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We want&mdash;" Zoe Stevens was about to demand an exorbitant price when Sean snapped. "Zoe, that's enough. I won&rsquo;t ask for money. I'll find a way to pay for Mom's medical expenses and rent!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, Sean looked straight at Grace and said, "Grace, I know I made a lot of mistakes. I was the one who pursued you and promised to protect you for the rest of my life. But I let you go to prison for the sake of the Stevens family and even watched Lily do what she did to you. Maybe me saving you this time is a way for me to pay you what I owe.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a flicker of pain in Sean's eyes as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He realized that Lily was the real perpetrator when the truth was finally revealed to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was also half the reason why Grace was turned into a scapegoat. It was because Lily liked him, but he loved Grace at the time. Therefore, Lily targeted Grace to kill two birds with one stone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So you don't need to give me any money. Let's just end everything here!" With that said, Sean left as he did not want to make a fool of himself any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Zoe Stevens stomped her feet as she watched Sean leave. Then, she looked at Grace with hatred. "Grace, it's your fault that the Stevens family has turned out this way. Shouldn't you compensate us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said indifferently, "I&rsquo;ve never owed the Stevens family anything. Why should I compensate you? Zoe Stevens, you don't have to shout in front of me. Sean saved me, and I would give him money if he asked me for it. But I won't give you a single cent, so you can forget about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After speaking, Grace walked into the Reed family's mansion. Zoe Stevens glared at Grace's back with hatred before finally leaving with a heart full of reluctance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Back at the residence, Grace hesitated a little before ordering the bodyguard beside her, "Look into what illness Sean&rsquo;s mother is afflicted with and her medical bills.&rdquo;</p></div>
