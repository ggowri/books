        <h1>Chapter 765</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, he must be here to look for me. I've spent a good deal of time on the hill, so he must&rsquo;ve been worried.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace subconsciously wanted to run to Jason's side. However, she was still being carried by Brian, so she immediately said to him, "Let&hellip; Let me down first." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Going over to Jason?" Brian's cold voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she gave a definite answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, once I put you down, I'll be indifferent to whatever happens to you from now on. You'll only be a stranger to me, and you must stop calling the name 'Bryn'. It's not something you can call."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Brian said was like a warning, but it was also like a goodbye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly found her nose a little sore, and it was as if something was pressing on her heart. It was somewhat depressing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because&hellip; I lied to him? Or is it because we were partners who once went through thick and thin together and are eventually becoming strangers now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it, Mr. Hart," muttered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They spoke so softly that only they could hear each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Brian bent his knees and crouched down to let Grace down. The scene secretly amazed Terrence who was standing next to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When has the crown prince of the entertainment industry carried a woman on his back like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If those entertainment reporters were here right now, they'd probably be so shocked that they&rsquo;d be at a loss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However&hellip;' Terrence looked anxiously at his boss who was beside him. Young Master Reed was calmer than he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He just stared at them with his back straight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the calmer he was, the more Terrence feared. It was as if a danger was coming and something was going to happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got off Brian's back and was about to walk toward Jason when Brian suddenly grabbed her wrist. She could not help but stop in her tracks and turn to look at him strangely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Luckily, you're not," he said out of nowhere, and before she knew it, he let go again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared blankly at him, and after a moment, her eyes fell on the wrist he had just grasped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she fell off the cliff, he had grabbed her wrist and pulled her up with all his might.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Brian was not there today, she might be groaning at the bottom of the cliff right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian..." She took a deep breath, and this time, instead of calling him Mr. Hart, she called his full name. "Thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she smiled a little and then turned to walk toward Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It... Was to show her gratitude and also say goodbye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thanked him for finding her for so many years for a promise they had made and for saving her in such a dangerous time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at Grace's back as she walked toward another man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, he felt a little relieved. 'Luckily, she's not the one I'm looking for. Otherwise, I might not have been able to let go just now.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe even though he knew that she loved Jason and that going against a man like Jason would be hard to deal with, he would hold on to her and keep her by his side. Even if it meant involving the entire Hart familyHart family in this fight.</p></div>
