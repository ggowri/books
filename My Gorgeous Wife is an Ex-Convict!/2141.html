        <h1>Chapter 2139</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even he could not help feeling jealous over how important Lina was to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, thank you!" Grace said gratefully. She knew he had put the entire Reed family on the line for her when he confronted the Hunter family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, you never have to thank me," muttered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would try his best to do everything she wanted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the other side, Martin Weiss sent Kyla to the store&rsquo;s entrance. Kyla unbuckled the seatbelt but did not get off immediately. Instead, she turned to look at Martin Weiss. "Thank you for stepping up and helping today." She was referring to Martin Weiss including the Weiss family when Jason threatened the Hunter family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Even if I hadn&rsquo;t done that, the little boy would&rsquo;ve saved Lina anyway," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That child cared about Tina Stephenson the most, so everything else was secondary. The little boy would save Lina as long as Tina Stephenson cried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "Thank you anyway.&rdquo; She was about to get out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, in this day and age, do you still want to risk your life to have this baby?" They had just witnessed what had happened to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You heard what that child said. Lina had difficulty delivering the baby because someone did something to her. I think we can avoid that if we're more careful. I don't want to give up this baby so easily." Kyla got out of the car after she finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss froze. She had just said the word &lsquo;we&rsquo;. She was putting both of them on the same team for the first time in years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That one word filled his heart with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does this mean that her attitude toward me has softened a little?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'As long as this goes on day by day... She&rsquo;ll eventually learn to trust me again and believe that I love her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Maybe... she'll be willing to come back to me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Even though that day seems so far away, I still hope for it&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The hospital ward became quiet again. Hadwin Stephenson stayed beside the hospital bed as he stared at the person lying on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was the one he loved the most, but he could only watch her sleep soundly again and do nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was like how it was back then, and it was unexpectedly still the same after all these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, you'll wake up this time, won't you?" he murmured as he held her right hand, which lay by the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if her temperature and touch would give him the courage to wait for her to wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was only awake for half an hour just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was so scared that she would only be awake for a short time, just like what had happened in the delivery room previously. He was worried she would fall into an endless sleep again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Every minute and every second was hell to him.</p></div>
