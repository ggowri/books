        <h1>Chapter 387</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she had said those words somewhat impulsively last night, but the things she said were also true. She did seem to have fallen in love with this man without even knowing it... This man was called Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt a mixture of fear and affection for him. They were two different emotions, but they somehow mixed well together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You also said you want to date me, right?" He added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ahh!" Grace froze suddenly. Then, she remembered that he had held her in his arms after she said that she liked him last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do I have to do for you to like me alone and not anyone else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she heard this, she said, "Like you alone... Do you mean as a boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Boyfriend? Is Sis trying to date me?" he murmured in a somewhat indulgent whisper at her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Date? When the word burst into her mind, it was as if her mind had gone blank. Perhaps it was because she had never thought about dating him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her with a smile. "Then let's date. What do you think, Sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know how to answer Jason's question all of a sudden. Dating? Jason and her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the most unfathomable thing was about to happen to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You cannot go back on your word, Sis." Jason's lips were close to Grace's ear, his breath as fragrant as an orchid. He said, "You&rsquo;ve said it yourself, Sis, and I won't let you go back on your word even if you want to." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a flash of determination in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, he would not let her back out. Now that she had fallen into his hands, how could he be willing to let go?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt as if her heart was... completely messed up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dating. Was she really dating Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace went to work at the restaurant, she was still a bit stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she got to the restaurant, she did not see Kyla Corbyn there. She only saw Mrs. Corbyn holding Nelson in her arms at the cashier counter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where's Kyla?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She has... gone out for an errand. I suppose she'll be back soon," answered Mrs. Corbyn a little awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not notice Mrs. Corbyn's awkwardness. She started preparing for her work at the restaurant. Then, she picked up Nelson and played with him for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one loved Grace, so when Grace picked him up, he gave Grace a shy smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace would also communicate with the little one with her broken sign language, unaware that Mrs. Corbyn's face was full of worry as she watched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was now standing in a big office, looking at the man in front of her who was known as the prince of the entertainment industry&mdash;Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In all those times she had come to see Brian, she never in any way thought that one day she would voluntarily ask to meet him under such circumstances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"According to my secretary, you've been asking to see me," said Brian as he looked at Kyla Corbyn. He would not have seen her if she had not mentioned another name to his secretary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart, well... I've come to see you today to ask for something," Kyla Corbyn said humbly.</p></div>
