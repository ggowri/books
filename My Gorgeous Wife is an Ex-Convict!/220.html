        <h1>Chapter 219</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only after entering the lounge that Brian placed Grace on the sofa. Looking at her left hand that was gently covered by her right hand, he asked, "Does it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A little," she mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at the pained expression on her face. He knew that she was understating it. Her face had always been peaceful and calm. She never used to furrow her brows and paled like she was now. She was even speaking with much difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her like this, his heart ached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a strange feeling to him. When he saw her kneeling and groveling on the ground&hellip; When he saw the copper stove smashing against her hand... All of a sudden, he felt as if his heart was being whipped violently. It was extremely painful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, almost reflexively, he rushed forward to help her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why did he do that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had been in town before and proved that she was not the one he was looking for, but it was as if his emotions were still affected by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it because of her looks? Was it because she looked like the person he remembered, so he was emotionally affected even though he knew she was not the woman he was looking for?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not long before the film crew's doctor arrived and rushed to give Grace a preliminary examination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the doctor's hand touched the location of Grace's injury and made sure that there was no problem with the bone, he intensified his gesture. Naturally, the pain Grace felt was severe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her teeth were firmly biting her lower lip, and a thin layer of sweat on her forehead emerged. She only nodded and shook her head to answer the doctor's questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, when the doctor was done examining her, she felt as if she was exhausted. There was cold sweat on her forehead and back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's nothing wrong with her bones. Just give her some medicine for the bruising, and rest this hand as much as possible for the time being. Don't use it for any heavy lifting," the doctor said. "If you're still worried, you can go to the hospital and have another thorough examination."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he was only the film crew's staff doctor. He could easily deal with small injuries. There was nothing he could do about more serious injuries as he did not have any medical equipment here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. Thank you, doctor," Grace said, finally relieved. If she did break a bone, she would not know what to do with her job at the Sanitation Service Center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People with jobs like her could not afford a long vacation. There was no way the Sanitation Service Center was going to allow her to take a long sick leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the doctor left, Brian said, "It might be all right, but you better go to the hospital for a check-up later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's all right. I'll just run down to the pharmacy and get some medication for my bruising," Grace said. "Thank you&hellip; for just now"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyway, had he really picked her up and asked the film crew's doctor to check her wound?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned slightly. "What was that all about? Why were you kneeling and groveling?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she kept repeating those actions again and again! Earlier, he saw her doing that when he came by. Only that time, he only saw her back and did not recognize her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His visit to the set today was only an impulse to visit Evelyn at work. When he approached her at the set, he saw the copper stove prop falling on the extra&rsquo;s hand. He only recognized the extra as Evelyn when that happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. I knelt and groveled in the right way, so they made me kneel and grovel again to teach the other extras," Grace said lightly. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian narrowed his eyes, and his gaze fell on her forehead. Before, he could not see clearly because her forehead had been bathed in a thin layer of sweat. Now that she had taken a tissue to wipe away the sweat from her forehead, he could see that there was a round red mark in the middle of her forehead.</p></div>
