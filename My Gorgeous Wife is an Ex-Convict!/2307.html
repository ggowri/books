        <h1>Chapter 2305</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought for a moment and said, "If the victims&mdash;you and Martin Weiss&mdash;come out with a memorandum of understanding and have the lawyer argue that Jacqueline Bowman was instigated by the principal offender, then the best she can get is probation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Probation?" Kyla wondered whether Jacqueline Bowman would be willing to tell her Amber Mitchell's whereabouts if she got out on probation and did not have to go to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "What's the matter? Why are you asking this all of a sudden? If you&rsquo;re worried about a lawyer defending Jacqueline Bowman and that she&rsquo;ll be released, you can rest assured. The Weiss family found a renowned lawyer in the country who hasn't lost a case in the past ten years. That lawyer is known for being ruthless. He&rsquo;ll fight this case with all his might. Jacqueline Bowman can forget about getting out of prison in the next ten years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla's face turned a little pale after Grace said that. "Is it possible to get her probation with this lawyer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace seemed to sense something and asked in confusion, "What's the matter? Are you hoping... that she&rsquo;ll be let off on probation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have a friend I&rsquo;ve lost contact with, and Jacqueline Bowman knows her whereabouts. She&rsquo;ll only tell me her whereabouts if she gets released!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "So you&rsquo;re going to get Jacqueline Bowman probation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She wants an acquittal, but probation is the best she can get, right?" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is your friend important to you?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled bitterly. "She means as much to me as Lina does to you. Without her, perhaps Nelson and I wouldn&rsquo;t be here today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace understood how important that person was to Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "Jacqueline Bowman says my friend is miserable now. She's living like a lunatic, being abused and living a life worse than death. If what Jacqueline Bowman said is true, I need to find her as soon as possible! Grace, you know the law better than I do. I just want to know what the chances are that she'll get probation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace replied, "Ten percent. With the lawyer representing the Weiss family in this case, you'll only get a ten percent chance of winning even if you issue a memorandum of understanding without Martin Weiss. I can help you ask my mentor to fight this case. After all, the evidence is solid!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's heart sank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, Grace continued saying, "Unless the Weiss family doesn't want to pursue Jacqueline Bowman too and the Weiss family's lawyer pins all the blame on Mr. Lambert. In that case, Jacqueline Bowman might get a lighter sentence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla only felt her heart sinking more and more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Kyla, if you want to find out your friend's whereabouts, we can think of other ways to track her down. We can investigate the people Jacqueline Bowman has been in contact with to see if there are any clues.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla replied in acknowledgment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she knew full well that it might take a long time to find any clues. Even if they did find out Amber Mitchell's whereabouts, it would take a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unless... she went to Martin Weiss to get him to issue a memorandum of understanding and get the lawyer not to go against Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, how could she ask Martin Weiss this in their present state? Kyla felt horrible at the thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, Grace told Jason about Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, why don't you get someone to look into Jacqueline Bowman's past contacts and see if there's anything special? Perhaps we can get some clues about Kyla&rsquo;s friend?&rdquo; asked Grace. </p></div>
