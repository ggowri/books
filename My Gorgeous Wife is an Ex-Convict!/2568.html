        <h1>Chapter 2566</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory gently hugged his son. "Aunt... Amber Mitchell is willing to save your life, so please don't ever break her heart, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simon was silent and did not reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory looked down at him. The two pairs of similar eyes stared at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't ask her to save me. I don't even want her to," Simon said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said sternly, "I&rsquo;ll never forgive you if you break her heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The childish dark eyes filled with shock. His daddy was speaking so harshly to him for the first time. He was only seven years old, but he knew enough to know that this woman was... very important to his daddy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two days later, Amber Mitchell helped Simon with his transfusion in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When her blood flowed into Simon's body, she had a sense of satisfaction. At least she could save her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the blood transfusion made her feel increasingly exhausted, and she became drowsy. When she was resting in the temporary ward after completing the transfusion with the nurse&rsquo;s help, she fell asleep with the IV drip attached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In her sleep, she felt as if she was lying on the cold labor table again. After experiencing heart-wrenching pain, she did not hear the baby crying. The midwife said to her with a blank face, "The baby is stillborn."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stillborn...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought perhaps it was fated. God wanted her to have nothing to do with George Gregory, so God let their child die in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she seemed to see Herman again in a daze. Herman smiled and said to her, "Amber Mitchell, you have to be happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Happy&hellip; But how can I be happy if he's not around?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a trance, Herman turned around as if to leave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No..." She reached out her hand to catch Herman, not wanting him to leave. "No. Don't leave me... Don't..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed to vaguely grab Herman's hand, and a gentle voice said in her ears, "Amby, I won't leave you. I won't. I'll never..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Never leave me?' She felt relieved, and her lips curved into a smile. "We'll never... separate, Herman..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She muttered the name in her deep slumber. She was not aware of it. She had no idea that George Gregory's expression seemed to freeze, and his body froze when he heard her mutter the name &lsquo;Herman&rsquo; as he stood at her bedside. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had just called out Herman's name, which meant she did not want Herman to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she even dream about Herman Moss in her sleep?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jealousy arose in his heart. It was so strong that he could hardly contain it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always thought that perhaps she married Herman Moss and said she loved Herman Moss to repay Herman Moss for saving her life. Perhaps she even did it just to annoy him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she called out Herman Moss's name in her sleep, he suddenly realized that maybe she truly did not love him anymore and loved Herman Moss just as she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand held hers tightly. Her mutilated right hand could never be whole again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Have I really lost her? Have I lost the woman I want to care for forever?'</p></div>
