        <h1>Chapter 4083</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina looked at Chandler and asked, "You don't look too good. Were you really just catching up with Mr. Patel?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she was easy-going, she was not ignorant or foolish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If a branch of the family separated from the main family and changed their surname, then it was unlikely that there had been any pleasant experiences between the two sides.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, it's possible that Weldon and Chandler's relationship isn't great, maybe even really bad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing, maybe just a little tired," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me drive later. I'll take Eugenia home first, then accompany you back," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I'm not so tired that I can't drive," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia came over from Kit's side just now. She went to find Kit herself earlier, hoping to take a photo together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit naturally didn't refuse her request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is the photo taken?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mm, it's done. I want to print it out and frame it," Eugenia said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was amused by her friend's words!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia originally wanted to say more flattering words about Kit, but seeing Chandler next to her, she didn't say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After greeting some of the filming staff, the three of them left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kit, there's still an event later. You should go remove your makeup now," Kit's assistant said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." Kit responded, glancing at Tina and their departing figures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first, he thought she was just the kind of rich girl he despised the most, but inexplicably, his opinion of her was slowly changing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially when she was shooting, her dedication was stunning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, she said she was his fan, not just casually flattering him or simply interested in his appearance, but... she really paid attention to his performances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Performances that hardly anyone remembers, she remembers them so clearly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Usually, as the person involved, having such a fan would make one very happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since his debut, many fans have always focused on his face, which he feels dissatisfied with. He doesn't want others to only pay attention to his face, but also to his songs, his performances, and what he wants to show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not just a face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Otherwise, it seems that all he needs is a face, and all other efforts are irrelevant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Tina clearly noticed his efforts, so why does he still feel dissatisfied?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What is this dissatisfaction exactly?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After sending Eugenia home, Tina and Chandler went to his place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to rest for a while?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need," Chandler said, "I'm much better now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at his complexion, which was indeed better than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can I stay here tonight?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your parents will worry," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Don't worry, they trust you since I'm with you, and my mom says you're an upright gentleman," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> His eyes narrowed slightly. If her parents knew about his desire for her, they probably wouldn't say that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It's just that he can barely control this desire with his current self-restraint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If his desire ever surpasses his reason, then...</p></div>
