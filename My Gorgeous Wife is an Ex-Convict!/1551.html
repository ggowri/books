        <h1>Chapter 1549</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After some time, Nelson came to his senses and realized that he was still holding onto Grace. His child-like face was flushed. He was shy and somewhat at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help smiling. Nelson was still the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As Mick Reed was in kindergarten, Grace only brought Jasper over today. The two children got along well with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The only near crisis that happened was that Jasper had spotted the hearing aid in Nelson's ear. Out of curiosity, she reached out to pull on the hearing aid. It almost fell into a cup of water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace quickly explained the hearing aid to her daughter and warned her not to randomly take it off Nelson&rsquo;s ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper blinked as if she did not understand. "Nelson, you can't hear without wearing this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, I can't hear, so I have to wear it," replied Nelson Corbyn as he put his hearing aid back on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now that he was older, he was more aware of some of the world's discrimination against the disabled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though he was just like a regular person with the hearing aid on, there were always people at school who pointed at him or gave him sympathetic or mocking looks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then this hearing aid is amazing! It can let you hear, Nelson. It's great that you can hear. I can play you a lot of wonderful tunes! Even Grandpa Professor praised me, saying that I play well!" Jasper said with bright eyes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Had ther been a piano, she would have loved to play him a tune right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Nelson Corbyn looked at the little one before him somewhat blankly. There was pure joy on her little face. She was happy that he could hear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was a very different reaction than everyone else when they learned that he could not hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Somehow, it made him feel as if there was something warm in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, I'll listen to the tunes you'll play in the future, Jasper." Music was not a beautiful sound to him. What he heard in his hearing aid were mechanical sounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could understand words but could not hear melodious music.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, &lsquo;melodious&rsquo; only existed as an adjective. He might never be able to experience it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, looking at the little one who was shorter than him, he wanted to listen to the music she played very much. He had a strange desire to listen to her play tunes for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was glad that her daughter and Nelson were getting along. While talking with Kyla, she learned that Kyla had been doing well in the past few years. She still needed to take medicine two years prior but did not have to take them anymore. She just needed to go for regular check-ups every six months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I've seen the news. Martin Weiss helped you to reverse your case. Paisley Daniels was also sentenced to prison for five years. You finally got your justice," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss also paid a heavy price for the case reversal. His testimony back then was partly influenced by Paisley Daniels, so he did not face severe legal punishment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even so, Weiss Group's stock prices dropped quite a bit and even caused a negative impact on the company's reputation. This loss could not be measured with money.</p></div>
