        <h1>Chapter 2338</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had a feeling that she was deeply in love with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh. How could I have that delusion?' Martin Weiss shook his head. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How is that possible? If she loved me deeply, she wouldn&rsquo;t have chosen to separate from me. I tried so hard to keep her, yet she mercilessly rejected me...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, you&rsquo;re nothing but the woman I once loved," he murmured as if to remind himself of something!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla received a phone call from Chase Harper at night. "Uh... Sorry for today. Did I cause any misunderstanding between you and Mr. Weiss? I can apologize if I did."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper said, "Also, you forgot to take the gift I bought for Nelson when you left. I'm going back the day after tomorrow. Why don't I drop by your hotel and give it to you before I go back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're going back the day after tomorrow?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I'm almost done here. I'm meeting the client tomorrow to wrap things up," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you&hellip; help me bring the gift for Nelson back to Emerald City and then go to the store to pass it to my mother? I'll also buy some snacks. Please help me take them back to my mother. She hasn't eaten L City's snacks for many years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she could buy them online, they did not taste like what they were familiar with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mother's favorite food was the pastries sold in a bakery near their house. She had dropped by earlier and found that it was still there, selling the same pastries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She planned to take some with her when she went back. However, since Chase Harper was going back first, she would buy some for Chase Harper and Juliet. She would ask him to bring the rest back to her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Chase Harper replied, "Okay, I'll come to the hotel to get them, then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Kyla went to the bakery to buy pastries, which could no longer be found in many places now. However, one could still find them here, and they tasted just as she remembered it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bought some pastries and was about to leave when a car pulled up near her. The backseat window rolled down slowly, and Mrs. Weiss's face came into Kyla's view.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Corbyn, can we talk?" asked Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze and got into the car after hesitating a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Corbyn, are you here to buy pastries? The bakery here sells traditional pastries. Youngsters don't enjoy them." Mrs. Weiss glanced at the pastry bag Kyla was carrying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aunt, what do you want to talk to me about? Just go ahead," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss told the driver to drive and then said, "Let's find a place where we can drink tea and sit while we talk. After all, a car isn't a place for conversation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said nothing more. She turned her head to look at the receding scenery outside the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove up to a club. Mrs. Weiss and Kyla got out and entered a private room.</p></div>
