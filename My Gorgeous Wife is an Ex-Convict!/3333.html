        <h1>Chapter 3331</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina looked regretful and said, "I think Hadwin is overthinking and worrying too much. But since he is genuinely scared, I can't insist on it. Besides, to be honest, having a second child doesn't make much of a difference in my family. Most of the time, it's just like having two children."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her future son-in-law often drops by for a visit and they even have a special room in the house just for him to stay overnight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that room, the future son-in-law's personal belongings are increasing day by day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace and Valda couldn't help but laugh at the words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda is very curious about Lina's future son-in-law, but she hasn't had the chance to meet him yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When can I have the chance to meet your other child at your home?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After you finish your postpartum confinement, I'll bring my two children to visit you at your home," said Lina. "Originally, both of my children were with me today and I could have brought them over, but Grace was worried that they would be too noisy, so I didn't bring them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, next time you must bring it to show me," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three of them chatted for a while, and the topic turned to the Abbott family tragedy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the three of them were aware of the tragedy that had befallen the Abbott family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is Jasper doing now?" Valda asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Her mood is still very low," Grace said. "Unless we can find Lawrence, there's nothing we can do but wait for time to heal her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can the child still be found?" Lina also asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace shook her head. "The hope is very slim. In about a week, the police will stop searching."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the police will not use a large amount of manpower to search for a person indefinitely. After a certain period of time, they will stop searching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, from now on, we can only rely on our own resources?" Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Grace sighed. "But I will continue to search. No matter what, no matter...life or death, I will find him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, she would think that if they hadn't gone to find Lawrence, the Abbott family would still be living in poverty, but at least Wilona wouldn't have borrowed money at high interest rates to gamble, and she wouldn't have been killed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, a sudden change in life can make people greedy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was their family that changed the fate of the Abbott family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since Lawrence was able to escape from those people before, I don't think it's so easy for him to die," Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hopefully," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, in the waiting room outside the hospital room, three men were sitting. "Congratulations, you have a daughter and become a father," Hadwin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's the baby's name?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Harley," Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason raised his eyebrows, "I thought you would combine your and Valda's names to make your baby's name."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's face showed a hint of discomfort. He had actually thought about naming his child Valda Hart. However, his parents vetoed the name, stating that it would be confusing to call out Valda and have both the older and younger children respond.</p></div>
