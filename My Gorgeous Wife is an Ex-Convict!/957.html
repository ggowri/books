        <h1>Chapter 956</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah, sure!" Although Brian had not introduced himself, Lawyer Carter recognized him and agreed. He took him to a conference room and told Grace, "You can talk to Mr. Hart here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace was a little speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the door closed, only Grace and Brian were left in the conference room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There seemed to be an indescribable sense of depression in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside the conference room, Andrea Schwartz and the other colleagues were stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The plot twist was too unexpected. What started as someone meeting their lover turned into the girlfriend trying to confront the homewrecker. Then, the story changed again. Grace was not a homewrecker and she seemed close to the entertainment industry&rsquo;s crown prince.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Andrea Schwartz saw Brian, her mood was different from the others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian had previously run into them when she was giving Grace a hard time and defended Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought Brian had lost interest in Grace when the internet was full of gossip about him and Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, no woman would last long with the crown prince of the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, who would have thought that Brian would appear again today and defend Grace as before?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'What on earth does Grace have for Brian to defend her like this?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Andrea Schwartz felt a mixture of hate and jealousy. Her boyfriend, who was an associate professor, was nothing compared to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The colleagues who had been taunting Grace for corrupting the office's code of conduct by being a homewrecker immediately shut their mouths and stared at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the conference room, Grace looked at Brian and said, "Thank you for that, but I don't think we have anything to talk about, Mr. Hart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it had not been for Brian, she might have gotten injured again. However, she had no idea what Brian was doing here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on with you and Jason?" asked Brian. She was with Jason at the banquet that day, but she seemed reluctant. "Do you have a secret? Let me know if you do. I can help you out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Help me?" Grace raised her eyes. "Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Yeah, why?' Brian looked at the woman in front of him. Frankly speaking, he had nothing to do with her. "You're Stella's cousin. What's so weird about me helping you out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does your fondness extend to everyone related to the person you like? Would you have liked whoever that little girl was and what she grew up to be?" Grace asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian frowned slightly. "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled faintly. "Nothing. I just think you're really nice to Stella. You'd even care about her cousin."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'No, my concern for you isn't because of Stella, but&hellip;' The answer was about to escape his heart! Pursing his lips slightly, Brian said, "You haven't answered me yet. What's going on between you and Jason?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That doesn't seem to concern you, Mr. Hart. I also don't need your help," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She promised Jason that she would become his sister again for Kyla and Nelson's sake, so she could not go back on her words now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, one had to give something for what they got.</p></div>
