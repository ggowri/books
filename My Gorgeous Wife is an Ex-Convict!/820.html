        <h1>Chapter 819</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was framed for stealing money in class, and everyone thought I stole it. The teacher kept lecturing me, wanting me to admit it. My parents even took the initiative to say that they were willing to pay for the money I stole when I really didn't!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said while sniffling, her nose suddenly feeling somewhat sore. "I don't know if you can understand that helplessness. It's like the whole world has betrayed you, so you become helpless and alone. It was useless no matter how much I tried to explain and defend my innocence. At that time&hellip; Grace believed in me and even helped me find out who stole the money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Lina laughed again. "I decided then to make Grace my best friend forever!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin pursed his thin lips. 'It was just... such a small thing that made Lina willing to risk everything for Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not that he could not understand the feeling she spoke of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since he was an illegitimate child, he had faced so many treacherous actions since he was little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he was set up and wronged many times, he would bear it. He understood that rather than clearing his name, it was better to save his strength and strike with one blow when he was strong enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like how he chose the best timing to become the patriarch of the Stephenson family in one fell swoop while his aunt and her two sons could only live under his nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Therefore, you chose to believe Grace when she was imprisoned?" asked Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I believe in Grace. If she said it wasn't her, it certainly wasn't her! Isn't that what real friends are supposed to be like?" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was silent. 'This silly woman. Does she know how many people in this world have been betrayed by their best friend?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just because Grace had helped her in the past, she was willing to make unconditional sacrifices for Grace. This made her seem like a fool to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... it was because of her &lsquo;silliness&rsquo; that made him, who was familiar with people's dark side, that he could not help being sentimentally attached to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if staying by her side, he could really relax and ignore the conspiracies and power struggle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sighing, Hadwin raised his hand and touched Lina's bangs. "Don't be so impulsive as today. You were lucky today. Jason only let you go for Grace's sake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina hesitated for a moment before nodding. She knew that she had acted impulsively today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, did she regret it? Not really. She was not afraid that Jason would lay a hand on her, but she was a little afraid that Jason would do something to her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you&rsquo;re angry, furious, and want to deal with someone, tell me. I don't mind being a sword in your hand that can help you deal with people. Just don't be reckless, all right?" Hadwin said earnestly. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This girl's impulse even made me break out in a cold sweat.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was shocked. She looked at the person in front of her with those round eyes, remembering that Hadwin had shielded her to face Jason after she slapped the man. He was even willing to bear the consequences of her impulse. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was such a mess earlier that she was too angry to think about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now she thought about it in detail, she felt a trace of unspeakable emotion. 'Doesn&rsquo;t he want to get even with me? Why does he always seem to protect me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if... I'm going against Jason, you're willing to be the sword in my hand?" Somehow, the words escaped her mouth.</p></div>
