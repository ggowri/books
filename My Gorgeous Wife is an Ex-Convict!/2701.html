        <h1>Chapter 2699</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the beginning, he said they would only hug and hold hands!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... her mind flashed back to how he had sent someone to save her when she was desperate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it had not been for him, there was no telling how much more miserable she would be right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she should repay him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, he also said kissing was only two people's skin touching if they had no feelings for each other. It was just like a handshake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took a deep breath and closed her eyes. Then, she raised her chin slightly and gestured as if she would accept it. However, she kept telling herself in her head, 'It's just a handshake. It's just a handshake!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she was trying to hypnotize herself into thinking it was just a handshake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching the woman close her eyes, Brian knew she was accepting the kiss. Their faces got closer, and he saw a thin layer of sweat on her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was nervous. Her beautiful eyebrows furrowed slightly as her lips trembled gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The trembling even spread to her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she was not only nervous, but she was also scared. Even so, was she letting him kiss her in front of the crowd just to prove something in a game?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With his eyelashes trembling slightly, Brian's arms gently wrapped around Valda Theller's shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her trembling also reached his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips slowly approached her face. With his eyes glimmering slightly, his lips finally settled on her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze before suddenly opening her eyes. They were full of surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian looked away and said, "Alright, let's proceed." The indifferent statement seemed to be telling them that the episode was over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross pressed her red lips tightly as she glared at Brian. She said nothing in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked down, feeling her heart still beating violently. The spot on her forehead where he had kissed her was burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought Brian would kiss her on the lips, but... he only kissed her on the forehead. She had no idea whether she was glad or disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh, why am I disappointed?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller scolded herself in her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh? It's your turn, Valda. Do you want to choose truth or dare?" A voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze. She just realized that she was drawn this time, and the one speaking earlier was Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'll choose dare," she said, afraid of being asked weird questions if she chose truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was the one to give the punishment task. He looked back and forth at Valda Theller and Brian before saying, "Why don't you do five push-ups?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Only five push-ups?' Valda Theller was instantly relieved to hear that. However, what Patrick said next made her scalp go numb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Brian has to lie underneath you when you do the push-ups!" Patrick said with a playful smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller widened her eyes. 'Having Brian lie underneath with me on top? Won't I... touch his body if I'm careless?'</p></div>
