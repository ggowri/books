        <h1>Chapter 1664</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The security guard was instantly dumbfounded when he heard that. He had just noticed the broken flower pot and the soil on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The security guard quickly loosened his grip, and Grace asked her bodyguard to check Sean's wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After examining it, the bodyguard said to Grace, "Young Madam, he has a broken wrist."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Take him to the hospital, then," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," the bodyguard answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Grace's phone rang suddenly. Her expression instantly changed when she answered it and heard what the person on the other end of the line told her. "Okay, got it. Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After ending the call, Grace did not enter the building but went straight to the courthouse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The bodyguard took Sean to the hospital. After Grace came out of the courthouse, she received a call from the bodyguard saying that Sean had seen a doctor. The injury was not too serious, and he could recover in about a month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, give him the compensation he deserves and let me know if he has any additional requests," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After that, Grace called Old Lawyer Watts. "Mentor, I'm sorry. We may have some trouble ahead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know. Damian Harmon filed a lawsuit, didn't he? It doesn't matter. Let the procuratorate investigate. We did nothing wrong with the case. I'm an old man. I don't care about the gossip. My wife knows you, so she won't think much of it, but you and your husband have just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace quickly said, "He won't misunderstand anything. Jay trusts me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Good," Old Lawyer Watts said with relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason did not come home for dinner that evening. The butler said, "Young master Reed said he&rsquo;ll be back late today, so Little Young Master, Little Young Lady, and Young Madam should have dinner first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright," said Grace. After all, it was normal for his work to delay him. Grace told the maids to keep Jason's portion of dinner before eating with her son and daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On the other hand, Jason looked coldly at the seemingly honest woman in a commanding position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Who would have thought it was this woman who threw the flower pot from the 20th floor of the building?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This woman was the building's cleaner, an honest and cowardly woman. She was usually hardworking but did such a thing today. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So you don't know who told you to throw it, do you?" Jason asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The cleaner was blindfolded and had no idea that the person standing in front of her was Young master Reed, the last person anyone should mess with in Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, yes. I... I don't know. I just received a piece of paper and it had a typewritten message telling me to throw a flower pot at the woman when the time came. There was a check for 100,000 dollars with the note. They said they would give me another 100,000 dollars when the job was done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The cleaner stammered as she confessed everything. She was now scared out of her wits. She hated herself for letting greed get the best of her. She thought the building did not have any surveillance cameras and she could get 200,000 dollars just by throwing a flower pot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">200,000 dollars was enough to buy a house in her hometown!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not even think about what would happen to the person who would be hit by it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Unexpectedly, she was taken here after receiving her money. Her hands that she used to throw the flower pot were now covered in blood.</p></div>
