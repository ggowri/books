        <h1>Chapter 1126</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Grace told a staff member that she had come to deliver a USB flash drive to Stella and managed to make her way through the crowd to the rest area the film crew had borrowed from the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The makeup artist was giving Stella a makeover. She had not yet changed into her costume but was still wearing her own clothes, all of which were luxury brands. Besides, the luxury brands Stella liked had flashy logos as if she was afraid that people would not know she was wearing branded goods.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She also wore rings and bracelets on her hands, all of which were worth a fortune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the way Stella dressed, Grace wondered who could possibly imagine what her cousin looked like back in the small town.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, there you are," Stella said with feigned enthusiasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Here&rsquo;s the USB flash drive you wanted," Grace said as she pulled out a USB flash drive and handed it to Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella did not take it. Instead, she said to her, "I'm busy right now. I'm going to shoot my scene later. Why don't you go and wait for me in the lounge nearby? Besides the USB flash drive, I want to ask you a few questions about the case and relay them to Lawyer Carter for me. After all, you're his assistant, aren't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned, not wanting to linger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace's eyes landed on one of the extras waiting for their turn to film. She froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the person saw Grace, they froze for a moment before walking over and asking, "Grace, why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know each other?" asked Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, we know each other!" It was a woman under 30 with a brawny appearance and a strong build. She was disdainful toward Grace, but she was nodding and bowing to Stella in an attempt to curry favor with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, though she was just an extra on the set, she knew Stella&mdash;the most likely girlfriend of the crown prince right now! She heard that she even saved the crown prince's life when he was a child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While many people in the film crew secretly disdained Stella, but in the open, they tried hard to curry favor with Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, if they managed to be friends with Stella, they might be able to become friends with the crown prince too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the entertainment industry, who would not want to be friends with the crown prince Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the woman in front of her who had been in the same prison cell as her. The woman had beaten her numerous times, pulled her hair, and soaked her face in cold water. Even now, the choking pain was still so real to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face was cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Grace, Wu Mincui grinned and said, "What's the matter? We were sisters back then, so why the long face?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace snorted. "I don't have a sister like you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wu Mincui only felt herself being humiliated hard by Grace. When they were in prison, she had beaten and scolded Grace as if she were a cheap dog. Now, how dare Grace treat her this way, especially in front of Stella?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wu Mincui immediately said unhappily, "Have you forgotten that we were all in the same prison cell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after saying this, Wu Mincui was taken aback. She regretted it immediately. If people around them knew that she had been to prison, they would look at her with prejudice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She probably could not keep her job as an extra for long.</p></div>
