        <h1>Chapter 803</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's so protective of Paisley Daniels. He even thought about the baby for Paisley Daniels&rsquo;s sake, but&hellip;' "You said I owe you and Paisley Daniels a life, didn't you?" she asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stared at Kyla. He did not know why but her calmness now made him a little uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stood up and walked to the nearby bar. She took out a bottle of wine and an empty glass before pouring herself a drink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She might need a drink to give herself some courage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Red wine was poured into her mouth with a sweet and bitter feeling... 'It tastes really good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why had I never found wine to be so good before?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After drinking a glass of wine, Kyla slammed her glass against the edge of the bar. The glass broke in half immediately. She held the half-broken glass in her hand, and the rim of the glass was full of sharp glass shards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, are you crazy?" Martin Weiss fumed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, tell me how I can pay you a life?" Kyla asked with a faint smile as she seemed not to care about his anger right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His unease grew stronger. "What are you going to do?" There was a tension in his cold voice that he had not even noticed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This way, I shouldn't be able to have another child!" She smiled and thrust the half-broken glass that was in her hand toward her abdomen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Red blood gushed down the side of the cup, seeping into her clothes and getting on her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's pupils shrunk immediately as he lunged forward. "What are you doing?" he shouted, but he did not dare to touch the broken glass in her hand, for fear that if he did, he would aggravate her injury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All he could do was put one hand firmly around her wrist to stop her from pushing the broken glass further into her abdomen while his other hand was shakily holding his phone to call 999. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never thought it would be so hard to make an emergency call, but now he seemed to have spent all his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the call came through, he almost shouted to the operator on the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His usual calmness and composure were now trampled to pieces by this unexpected move! He could not even grasp his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the call was finally over, he glared at her, knowing that if he tried to pull out the glass that pierced her abdomen, she would bleed even faster!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She might even lose a lot of blood and go into shock before she reached the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, are you so unwilling to give birth to my child?" he asked with pain in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had forgotten why he had asked her to expiate herself by giving him a child in the first place. All he could think about was how eager the woman in front of him wanted to get away from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even at the cost of harming herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Isn't this woman obsessively infatuated with me? Doesn't she have to accept whatever I want?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Just like how she had to go to jail when I wanted her to go to jail!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, why... do I feel like everything is out of my control?'</p></div>
