        <h1>Chapter 1465</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she were emotionally unstable, then the babies would have to be born early.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn knew Grace was not willing to talk about it. Therefore, it was probably not something minor!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Whatever it is, just tell me if you think it's too much for you to bear alone. I might not be able to help much, but at least I can hear you out. It's better than keeping it all to yourself," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Thank you, Kyla," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I should be the one to thank you. You've helped me so much," said Kyla Corbyn. Grace had helped her find evidence when she was framed and was the key witness in her case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If it were not for Grace, she would not be where she was right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They chatted for a while. Kyla Corbyn told Grace some happy things to make her feel better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a while, Grace said, "Kyla, you haven't recovered either. You can go back first. Don't worry too much about me. I'll take care of myself. No matter what happens, I'll take good care of myself for the three babies in my belly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn saw the determined look in Grace's eyes and said with some relief, "Okay, then I'll go back first. Call me at any time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as Kyla Corbyn was about to leave, Grace suddenly said, "Kyla, is Brian... outside? Ask him to come in. I have a few questions to ask him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn was stunned for a moment before responding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Kyla Corbyn walked out of the ward, the two men outside looked at her and asked in unison, "How is she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two pairs of anxious eyes made Kyla Corbyn feel somewhat impressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Who would have thought that these two men who could make Emerald City tremble with a stomp of their feet were now waiting outside the ward because of a woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace is emotionally stable and wants to see Brian," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The expressions on both Jason and Brian's faces changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian seemed surprised while Jason's face turned a little pale. Just as Brian walked toward the ward door, Jason suddenly reached out his hand and stopped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Are you trying to stop me from going in?" asked Brian as he raised his brow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together tightly and looked at him coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian suddenly sneered, "Jason, the fear you feel now is how much Grace had suffered back then.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's between Grace and me. You have no right!" Jason's voice was cold and angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Since Grace wants to see me, then I must go in. Jason, you can't stop me!" said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two looked like they were about to fight. Kyla Corbyn hurriedly said, "Grace just woke up. Just give her whatever she wants."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stiffened after hearing this, but he withdrew his hands in the end. Brian walked into the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn sighed and looked at Jason. "Grace only has a few questions to ask Brian. It doesn't mean anything else," she explained because she was afraid Jason would misunderstand.</p></div>
