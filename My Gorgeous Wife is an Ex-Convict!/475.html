        <h1>Chapter 474</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You done seeing your grandmother?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grandma's still asleep. I didn't wake her up and came out first," answered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace was speaking, Stella Lindsay, her cousin, came out with two cups of tea and placed them in front of her and Jason. "Come and have some tea, Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a flash of surprise in Grace's eyes. Her cousin had never served her tea before when she came back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, Grace. Aren't you going to introduce the gentleman you brought here?" asked Third Aunt, her tone sounded rather jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's my boyfriend, Jason," answered Grace. She did not say Jason's full name on purpose so that her relatives would not cause a ruckus when they find out Jason was Jason. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All Grace wanted was for her grandmother to spend her remaining years in peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Boyfriend? Impossible!" exclaimed Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It sounded as if Grace had told a big joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason squinted his eyes and gazed coldly at Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, Stella Lindsay felt as if she had fallen into a hole in the ice. It was so cold that she could even feel the chill from the depths of her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, is it impossible?" Jason asked lazily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay smiled lamely. "No... Nothing. I just didn't think that Grace that has been to prison would find a boyfriend so soon after getting out. That's&hellip; fast&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay&rsquo;s words obviously meant much more than what was implied and were obviously referring to someone; it was a deliberate attempt to blow the whistle on Grace's imprisonment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In her opinion, Grace had been able to find a boyfriend because she kept her imprisonment hidden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could Grace not tell what Stella Lindsay was thinking? However, it was the first time she felt unembarrassed even though someone had exposed her imprisonment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was because Jason was sitting next to her, and he knew everything about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes darkened as he looked at Stella Lindsay, while his face tinged with anger. After a moment, he once again raised a smile from the corners of his mouth. "So what? Having Grace as my girlfriend is what I want. I was on cloud nine for several days when she said yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was actually telling the truth. When she agreed to be his girlfriend, Jason really felt that he had not been so happy for a long time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been unaware that people could be so happy when they managed to possess a treasure they desired!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay was shocked that Jason not only knew about it... but even said he desired it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was desirable about dating an ex-convict? Nevertheless, Hua Lifan was a little too afraid to ask Jason that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the man named Jason was now smiling, his gaze toward her was even colder than before. It made it difficult for her to sit still.</p></div>
