        <h1>Chapter 2786</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the servant walked into the room with the hangover soup, they saw Brian's long fingers massaging Valda Theller's head, and Valda Theller seemed to be enjoying it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The servant widened their eyes and looked at the scene in front of them in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, any servant who had been working here for a certain amount of time knew the crown prince was sexually reserved. It was said that the crown prince had a woman in his heart, so he would not have feelings for other women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman in the crown prince's heart was the Reed family's mistress. Therefore, even the servants had said privately that the crown prince would not find any other women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, last night, the crown prince brought a woman back to the mansion and was... now massaging her head. This did not seem like what the crown prince would do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian caught sight of the servant's dumbstruck expression, he frowned. "Put the hangover soup on the nightstand and get out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." The servant came to their senses, put the soup down, and left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian took over the soup and handed it to Valda Theller. "Drink this and your headache will soon disappear."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took over the bowl. With two hands holding the bowl, she drank it gulp by gulp. She felt comfortable after drinking the warm soup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for saving me... yesterday," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was late, or you wouldn't have had to suffer." Brian's face darkened as he asked, "Have they... treated you like this before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face was gloomy. "It's all in the past. I didn't expect them to do such a thing after graduating from university for so many years!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, how unruly. Who do they think they are? The judge?" Displeasure flickered in Brian's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had known from his research that she was taunted in university, but it was only described in a few sentences. He witnessed it himself last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was even angrier after witnessing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you saved my life yesterday. Camille told them about you and said you're my boyfriend. I think they won&rsquo;t dare to do anything to me anymore," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark phoenix eyes looked at her. "Do you think that's enough?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" She froze, still in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not enough. It's not nearly enough," muttered Brian. Watching Valda Theller, who was in a trance, he toned down the chill in his eyes. "Alright, hurry and finish the soup. It won&rsquo;t taste good if it gets cold." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." She quickly finished her soup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Your change of clothes is by the bed. You can go to the bathroom next door if you want to take a bath. It has everything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blushed when she saw the pile of clothes beside the bed, which also included lingerie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she blushed more when she looked down at what she was wearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Umm... My... My clothes..." She was even stammering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The clothes she wore were not her own but a new nightgown she had never seen. In other words, someone changed her clothes for her last night after she got drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. I got someone to change your clothes for you," he said.</p></div>
