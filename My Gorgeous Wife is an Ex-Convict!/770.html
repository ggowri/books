        <h1>Chapter 769</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If there was something cold about him before, now there was something gorgeous and amorous in his eyes. Even his licking of the bruise seemed seductive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about now? Does it still hurt?" he asked in a low whisper. He looked so seductive and was so gentle with his movements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It... It doesn't hurt that much anymore," even Grace's had begun to stutter a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could I feel the pain? He seems to have captured all my senses!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He planted scattered kisses on the red mark on her wrist, making her timidly try to withdraw her hand. After all, there were other people in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he stubbornly held her hand and would not let her take it back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't move!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." She looked embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't move. You mustn't move. Just stay like this. Otherwise, I don't know what I'll do." He suddenly implored her, and the hand that held her wrist was trembling slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned, feeling as though he was a little different than usual since he found her on the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there were outsiders here, and there were some things she could not ask directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver and Terrence who were at the front were almost stunned by what Jason had just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is that... really Young Master Reed? When has that superior man ever begged a woman with such a pleading tone?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated and did not move again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason gently closed his eyes and continued to kiss her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to remove all traces of Brian on her body and imprint her with his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What would he do if I take my hand away? Maybe... he'll just break my hand?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why was she with Brian today? Why did she let Brian carry her on his back? How much does Brian weigh in her heart?' These questions kept flashing through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was probably how it felt to have all your joys and sorrows manipulated by one person! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;ve tasted what Father had once tasted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, unlike Father, Grace won't betray me. She surely won't! She told me she loved me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kissed her hand repeatedly, rubbing it lightly with his cheek. He repressed and restrained himself like a cautious child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car pulled up to the entrance of Reed Residence, Terrence respectfully said, "Young Master Reed, we've arrived!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His long black eyelashes quivered a little and Jason opened his eyes slowly. His bright amorous eyes turned to the person beside him, and he carried her out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" screamed Grace. Her right wrist was now almost numb from his kisses and rubs, and all her blood seemed to be rushing up to her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, being carried out of the car by him like this made her lose her head!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay!" she called out to him, hinting at him to put her down, but he carried her straight back into the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He put her on the bed, squeezed his ten fingers between hers, and put her hands on top of her head. "Tell me. Why were you with Brian today? Why did he carry you on his back? What did you say to him?"</p></div>
