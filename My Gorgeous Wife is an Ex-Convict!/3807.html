        <div><span>.</span><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was about to go home after school when her phone rang. She looked at the caller ID and saw that it was Daniel calling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica frowned but still answered the phone. "What's up?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to talk to you about withdrawing my lawsuit," Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to withdraw your lawsuit, you can talk to the Reed family's lawyer directly. If you have any requests, you can also bring them up with them. Talking to me won't make any difference," Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to talk to them. I only want to talk to you. It's up to you whether you want to talk or not. If you don't want to, then forget it. Maybe I'll change my mind in a few days!" Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica hesitated for a moment and said, "Okay, where do you want to talk?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel gave her an address and said, "This is where I live now. Let's talk here. But I only want to talk to you, no one else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I understand," Veronica said. Regardless, since Daniel wanted to withdraw his lawsuit, she still planned to go see him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, withdrawing the lawsuit was the best outcome for Mason. Even if they broke up, she still hoped he would be okay and safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica went to the address Daniel gave her and arrived at his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a mixed and chaotic place, almost like a slum in the city, with all kinds of people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was a little surprised that Daniel would live in such a place, but when she </span><span>thought about his current situation, she could understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, his mother was in the hospital, he couldn't find a good job, and hospitalization required a lot of money. His life must be very difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was probably because of this that he was so stubborn, Veronica thought to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Veronica arrived at Daniel's door, she knocked twice. After a moment, Daniel opened the door and said, "Come in."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica entered the room, which was a small farmer's house with only a dozen square meters, and the furniture inside looked rather old and simple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Please sit down!" Daniel said, pointing to a chair next to a small square table in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica sat down as instructed. "Okay, I'm here. What do you want to talk about?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I only have water here, nothing else to offer you," Daniel said, pouring a glass of water and placing it in front of Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't come here for water!" Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel shrugged and sat down. "So, what do you think of the place where I live?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want me to think?" Veronica asked in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for Mason..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it weren't for him, your father would have gone to jail for corruption, your family's property would have been confiscated as stolen goods, and your life would not have been good," Veronica interrupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's face turned ugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you keep dwelling on the past, you'll never change anything. If you really feel that your life is not good, you should work hard to change it," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Daniel laughed. "Yes, you're right. I should work hard to change. That's why I came to talk to you today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any requests?" Veronica asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My request is to see you or Mason in pain!" Daniel said with a strange smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica frowned and suddenly stood up. "You didn't come here to talk properly at all."</span></p></div>
