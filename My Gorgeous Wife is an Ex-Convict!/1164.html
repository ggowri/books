        <h1>Chapter 1163</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is the woman telling me she's giving me her body in exchange for Nelson&rsquo;s custody? Since when was she able to trade with such things?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss laughed angrily. "Okay. I'll think about it if you take off your clothes now and please me in bed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said it only to humiliate her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she became as calm as before and whispered, "Okay." Then, she raised her hand to undress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Kyla Corbyn in disbelief and snapped. "Do you know what you're doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Kyla Corbyn replied dryly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even knew that what Martin Weiss said was probably just a casual remark. Even if she did what he wanted, he would still fight with her for Nelson&rsquo;s custody.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that she had no other choice, so even in such circumstances, she was going to place a bet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because she had nothing to lose...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's pupils shrank immediately. He suddenly grabbed Kyla Corbyn again and pushed her out of the door. "Get out. Get out of here! Your body will only make me sick!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The door slammed shut at the end of his sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn gave a wry smile and looked at the closed door. She had only humiliated herself today. She had lost so much, and now, she could not even keep her only child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was afraid to fight either the wrongful conviction or the custody case. She was afraid that if she did, the media would expose Nelson, and he would receive more unusual attention from others at such a young age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was deaf and already being looked at and treated differently by many people. If... She dared not think about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn lowered her head and left gloomily, while Martin Weiss, who was in the hotel room, leaned against the door and smiled wryly at himself. "Haha... Hahaha..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a perplexion in his laughter that he could not explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why... does Kyla Corbyn still annoy me after all these years? Is the child's custody so important? Is it so important that she would give up her body?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He even felt heartache! The pain was... overwhelming him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina also wanted to see Nelson after she learned Nelson was hospitalized, so the two came to the hospital together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson had already woken up, and Kyla Corbyn was beside the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the little one saw Grace and Lina, a smile immediately appeared on his little face, but the smile instantly collapsed because it had pulled the wound on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing the little one's bruised face and bandaged shin, Lina's heart instantly broke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it hurt? How long does he have to stay in the hospital? What did the doctor say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He should be able to leave in a few days. It's just some superficial wounds. There's no bone damage," said Kyla Corbyn. Nelson had done some more tests this morning. Luckily, there was nothing serious, so she was slightly relieved.</p></div>
