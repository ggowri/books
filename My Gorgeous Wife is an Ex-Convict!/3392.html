        <h1>Chapter 3390</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, when everyone came to the hospital to visit Harley, they learned from Brian and Valda that the head of the Quentin family, Samir, had come to perform surgery on Harley in the middle of the night. The faces of the people were filled with surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did Samir come over here?" Jason asked. He had heard of Samir before, but he wasn't sure about his medical skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, sometimes people exaggerate, and in Samir's case, he has never really made a name for himself in the medical field. Not many people know him, and his surgical videos have never been leaked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Speaking of this, Brian's expression seemed a bit helpless. "Harley and Lornell Quentin from the Quentin family are engaged, so Samir is willing to take action."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Engagement?" Grace widened her eyes, while Kyla almost choked on her saliva. As for Martin, despite his usual seriousness and calm demeanor, he also showed clear surprise at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Last night, Chandler brought Lornell to the hospital. While Lornell was calling the Quentin family to ask for their help in saving Harley, she mentioned that she was engaged to Harley in order to persuade them." Brian briefly recounted what happened in the middle of the night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason nodded in agreement upon hearing this. "That makes sense. If Harley is a member of the Quentin family, then the Quentin family will surely come to his rescue."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is Harley okay now? Will he wake up?" Grace asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Samir said he will wake up within 24 hours after the surgery," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Great!" Kyla exclaimed with tears of joy. The families have always had a close relationship, and Harley is lively and adorable. Kyla almost sees Harley as another daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After learning that Harley was unconscious and unresponsive, she has been extremely worried and scared these past few days. She is afraid that something serious might happen to Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, there is finally some good news!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The women present all had tears in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the Stephenson family's side, they learned from Chandler that Samir performed a life-saving surgery on Harley. Lina was so happy that she exclaimed, "We, the Quentin family, are capable! Harley is saved now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin said, "It seems like the Quentin family that he mentioned has no relation to your Quentin family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, we all have the surname Quentin! Chandler didn't say that Lornell's child is engaged to Harley? So our relationship will be even closer in the future!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin thought that if Lornell and Harley ended up together in the future, it would bring their families closer, especially the relationship between Lornell's family and the Quentin family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did Harley and Lornell really get engaged?" asked 8-year-old Tina to Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Uh-huh," Chandler responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are they just like us?" Tina blinked her eyes and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler lowered his eyelids slightly and after a moment said, "Yes, just like us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina suddenly smiled brightly and said, "That's great! In the future, if Harley doesn't have anyone to play with, she can find Lornell to play with. And she can ask Lornell to buy her food, help her with crafts, and tell her stories..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina has started to count on her fingers, helping Harley calculate the benefits of having one more fianc&eacute;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler raised an eyebrow, Lornell is doing these?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's really hard to imagine him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On this day, almost all the people who had a good relationship with Brian and Valda gathered in the ICU ward, waiting for Harley to wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Samir previously said that the child would wake up within 24 hours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But after all, they haven't really woken up yet. Only when they truly wake up can we feel at ease.</p></div>
