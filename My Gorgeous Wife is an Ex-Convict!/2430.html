        <h1>Chapter 2428</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not see his expression now, but his voice and body movements seemed to indicate that he minded this a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought and said, "Maybe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought you would say no," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want to lie to you. We agreed to be honest at all times," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His arm tightened around her. "If only I was your childhood sweetheart and had met you earlier..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if I did have childhood sweethearts, I would still fall for you all the same," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? You&rsquo;re not just saying that to cheer me up, are you?" He looked up and stared at her intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled and cupped his face. "Didn't I say I wouldn't lie to you? Speaking of which, I wish I had met you sooner. If I had met you when I was little, you certainly would&rsquo;ve been so cute!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's ears reddened slightly. She was the only one who would describe him as cute!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace's phone rang suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her phone and saw an unfamiliar number. When she answered it, she heard Brian&rsquo;s voice. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace? I have a lead on Amber Mitchell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Grace was surprised. Jason and Philip Barlow were still looking for Amber Mitchell, but Brian had found a lead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell has been transferred out of the hospital, but I&rsquo;ve found out where she is now," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where? Where has Amber Mitchell been transferred to?" Grace asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian gave an address and said, "I'm 500 meters away from there. You'd better be careful and not let yourself be seen when you get here. I'll send you my location later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the call, Grace received a location from Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Has Amber Mitchell been found?" Jason's voice rang in Grace's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, Brian said he found her. He&rsquo;s nearby the place where Amber Mitchell is being held," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes glimmered. They had just mentioned Brian and he had found the person they were looking for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though they had already settled the matters between them, Brian... still could not let go of his feelings for Grace. He found Amber Mitchell earlier than Philip Barlow and him. It could only mean that Brian had sent someone to keep an eye on Amber Mitchell earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What now? Are you going over?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, it's urgent. I want to go over and see what's going on. Why don't you continue having fun with the kids?" Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "I'll go with you. I can help you if there's any trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p></div>
