        <h1>Chapter 1615</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Compared to Martin Weiss's flustered state, Kyla seemed much calmer. "I came to tell you not to come here again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss stiffened and instantly turned pale. "I'm just watching you from a distance. I won't disturb you. Is... Is that not okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla said, "You don't have to do that. Martin Weiss, the best outcome for us is to never see each other. It should have been this way after the operation!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Never see each other...' Those four words hurt him. Even breathing felt painful. "I know I made a lot of mistakes. I... I'm trying to make it up to you. I... I also know that some things can't be fixed, but Kyla, I know it's my fault. I was wrong! All I ask is that you don't deny me the chance to see you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss said in distress. This man, who was superior to others, was now begging in front of the woman he loved most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Kyla said calmly, "What's the point in doing that? What happened can't be changed. Nothing else is going to happen between us. What difference does it make whether you see me or not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How do you know there'll be no difference? Kyla, don't you know how much I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before he could say the word &lsquo;love&rsquo;, she interrupted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin Weiss, don't say that word. It just makes my hair stand on end." It made her feel sick. She would rather he had never loved her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not want to hear the word &lsquo;love&rsquo; from his mouth because the word &lsquo;love&rsquo; only represented how silly she once was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Back then, he had also used love as a blade to hurt her badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss's face turned even paler. Under the moonlight, he seemed to be tottering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla said, "I won't cut off the relationship between Nelson and the Weiss family, nor will I stand in the way if he ever wants to go to the Weiss family and acknowledge you again. But I have nothing to do with you anymore. Having you constantly appear around me will only cause me trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, Kyla turned to go back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had already said everything she needed to say. She and Martin Weiss had nothing more to say to each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, her last words seemed to have triggered him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As she turned around, he darted forward and grabbed her hand like a drowning man clutching at the last piece of driftwood. "Trouble? Why would I cause you trouble? You still have feelings for me, don't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He said hurriedly. His dark, deep eyes stared at her as if he was longing for hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla suddenly laughed. "Martin Weiss, what makes you think I&rsquo;ll still have feelings for you? Don't you think it's funny that you&rsquo;re even asking me this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His hand trembled. He had longed so much to see her smile at him. Now that she was, he found the sight harsh on his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then why haven't you been with another man in the past five years? I know you hate me, and I know you probably don't believe me anymore, but... give me a chance. Give me a chance to make it up to you and our son, okay? Nelson... should have a complete family, shouldn't he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He admitted that he was despicable. He was pulling the emotional card by using their child, but never seeing each other as she had said was something he could not do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla said coldly, "I have no other man because I don't need love. You couldn&rsquo;t give Nelson a complete family when he needed one, and I don't think Nelson would like to see me forcing myself to be with you for his sake!"</p></div>
