        <h1>Chapter 3196</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If my parents were still alive and knew that I was taking wedding photos here today, they would definitely be very happy," Valda said with emotion. She also pointed to the nearby Ferris wheel and said, "At that time, I even told them that in the future, I would find the most handsome groom on that Ferris wheel!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of the childish words from the past, she couldn't help but smile. However, her eyes couldn't help but turn red because she thought of her deceased parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I wish... my parents were still alive to see her happy now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go, and ride the Ferris wheel up there," said Brian, holding Valda's hand and greeting the staff with a nod.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The staff then activated the equipment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Valda got on the Ferris wheel with Brian, she realized that the photographer who was supposed to follow them didn't come up. She looked at Brian with confusion and asked, "Aren't they going to take pictures?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't take any photos on the Ferris wheel because I want to do something. I only want to face you and don't want anyone else to disturb us," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's the matter?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Will you marry me?" Brian said. "I haven't formally proposed to you yet. I was planning to do it after the shoot today, when we were alone together. But proposing on the Ferris wheel like this is also great."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He spoke and took out a sparkling diamond ring from his pocket. Then, he knelt down on one knee in front of her and said, "Valda, will you marry me? From now on, I will never leave your side. I will protect you, love you, and cherish you for the rest of our lives. From this moment on, my life is yours!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's eyes became moist instantly as she stared at the man kneeling in front of her with one knee. The diamond ring in his hand was so brilliant and dazzling, as if it was meant to witness eternity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda leaned down and cupped Brian's face in her hands. She placed a kiss on his forehead and whispered, "Brian, you are my future for the rest of my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their remaining years, she doesn't know how many, but she thinks that the rest of their lives will surely be wonderful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the engagement ring was placed on her hand, Brian stood up and embraced Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She leaned against his chest, listening to the strong beating of his heart and watching the starry moonlight through the transparent glass of the Ferris wheel. If her parents saw Brian, they would surely be very happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, before we get married, would you accompany me to visit my parents' graves? I want to share this good news with them and make them happy too," Valda murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, then let's go together to visit your parents," Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The hot search for wedding photos lasted for three days before it ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's life is still the same as usual, and there hasn't been any leak of her personal information online. Her studio is also running as usual, with no reporters camping out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda knows that these benefits are due to Brian's connections and actions, which allow her to enjoy the peace of an ordinary person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And when Valda saw the finished wedding photos, she felt a strong sense of happiness in her heart.</p></div>
