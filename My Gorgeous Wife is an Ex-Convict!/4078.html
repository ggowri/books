        <h1>Chapter 4076</h1>
        <div>.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I heard from the news that you plan to try acting next, is that true?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, it is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Have you chosen a script yet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Still deciding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You looked great in the costume drama outfit. It would be great if you could act in a costume drama," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Costume drama?" He was slightly surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, costume drama. Do you remember the costume drama music video you did earlier? That's where I first saw you and became your fan!" Tina gestured with her hand, "You were wearing a black costume robe with red embroidery, and a red hat on your head. It felt really special, and there were also many martial arts movements in that music video. Your movements were great, it felt like you had trained for it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, the information about Kit did not mention any martial arts background, but it did mention that he learned dance when he was young. So his agile dance moves were often attributed to his childhood training.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit looked somewhat surprised after hearing Tina's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> That costume drama music video was rarely mentioned after he became famous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because in that music video, he was just a supporting actor, a green leaf for others. Even though he was part of the cast, that role was something he had fought hard for!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But at that time, he was just a nobody, and that music video didn't really give him any boost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When it was broadcasted, the public's attention was only focused on the main character.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And his scenes in that music video were only a few, and added together, they might not even be 20 seconds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But this woman in front of him said that she became his fan after watching that music video. Was that even possible?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Really? I almost forgot that I filmed that MV. But now that you mention it, I do have some recollection," Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina didn't mind and continued, "At that time, I searched for you online to see if there were any similar works, but I couldn't find any. It wasn't until later when Eugenia brought me to watch your performance on 'One Million Star' that I realized you were in this group. It's quite a coincidence that both Eugenia and I like you the most in your group!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was very direct and didn't hide anything. Her frank gaze made Kit understand that her so-called "like" was just a fan's admiration for an idol!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You're a fan, did your fianc&eacute; say anything?" Kit asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Oh, you mean Chandler? He even helps me with my fandom! Sometimes when I can't get tickets to my concert or want to see a certain celebrity, I ask Chandler for help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You're still a college student, how did you get engaged?" Kit asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although it's not uncommon for young people in wealthy families to get engaged, as far as he knew, Chandler was eight years older than her. It's not common for someone with such an age difference to get engaged early in a wealthy family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I was engaged to Chandler since I was born. What about you? Do you have a girlfriend?" Tina asked naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit was taken aback. He didn't expect the other party to ask such a direct question!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But before he could speak, Tina suddenly realized that she might have gone too far. "Sorry, I know this kind of thing shouldn't be asked casually. Just forget I asked!" she said.</p></div>
