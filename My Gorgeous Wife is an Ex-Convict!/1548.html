        <h1>Chapter 1546</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His daughter, who was sitting at his right side, was looking up at him with her dark almond-shaped eyes. She said in confusion, "Daddy, aren't you going to eat? It's Mommy's signature steamed bun. It's delicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As she spoke, the little one even said to Mick Reed who was beside her, "You think it's delicious too, don't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed's mouth was still stuffed with a steamed bun. He hesitated for a moment before nodding somewhat stiffly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He did not think the steamed buns were that good, but... they were made by his mother and he wanted to try them because many kids in cartoons as well as in his kindergarten ate food made by their mothers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At least, the steamed buns his mother made were not bad. They looked cute too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But... will Daddy eat these steamed buns?' Mick Reed had serious doubts about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two kids stared intently at their father while Grace said with a smile, "Try it. It's delicious. I spent a lot of effort making them." Rather, they were experiences she gained after numerous failures to make breakfast buns for her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together as he heard Uncle Kwan say, "Young </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Madam worked in the kitchen for over an hour to make them early this morning. I tried them and they're delicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason glanced at Grace's hand, looking at her slightly deformed fingers. His eyes seemed to sting a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason silently picked up the steamed bun on the table and began to eat it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed froze. He did not even notice that the steamed bun in his mouth had fallen out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Daddy... is eating the steamed bun Mommy made. Doesn't he dislike these little animal-shaped buns? He didn't even touch the piglet-shaped buns I used to eat.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper looked like she believed the buns made by her mother were the best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After breakfast, Jason was heading to his office while Mick Reed was going to kindergarten. Grace helped her son straighten his clothes before looking at Jason and reaching out for his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He seized her hand. "What are you trying to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I just want to help you with your tie. It's a little crooked," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stared at her. Moments later, he finally loosened his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Bend over again. It's easier that way," Grace said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes flickered a little, but he bent over as she wished. Grace raised her hand to adjust his tie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They were so close that he could easily touch her face if he lowered his head a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Have we done this before?" His voice rang out suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, we have. I used to tie your necktie." After adjusting his tie, she raised her hand and touched his head habitually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason immediately froze. 'Is she... touching my head?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No one in Emerald City dared to do that! He did not reject it&hellip; It felt familiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Waves set off in Mick Reed's usually calm heart. 'What is Mommy doing? Is she touching Daddy's head?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Will Daddy be angry?' Mick Reed thought to himself, but he somehow thought that his father liked it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Did you do this often too?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She said, "Yeah. Don't you like it? If you don't like it, I'll keep it in mind and won't do it again."</p></div>
