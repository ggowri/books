        <h1>Chapter 1284</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really want to know?" Grace glared at Martin Weiss disapprovingly. "Kyla asked Nelson why he got into a fight, and the reason was that the kids in the kindergarten said his mother's a criminal and a bad person! Mr. Weiss, this is all thanks to your fianc&eacute;e, Miss Paisley Daniels. If she hadn't gone to the kindergarten to spread the word, the children in the kindergarten wouldn't have known about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's expression immediately sank. He looked at Kyla Corbyn with mixed feelings as she cried bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, do you really have a clear conscience over Kyla's case back then? You've never been imprisoned. You don't know what it's like to be imprisoned. It was just a simple testimony to you, but it&rsquo;s a permanent stain on Kyla&rsquo;s life!" said Grace. She had no intention to listen to Martin Weiss's answer after she was done speaking. She went over to Kyla Corbyn and comforted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's crying gradually stopped after a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, don't worry about Nelson's hearing aid. I've discussed with Jay and will ask the doctor to customize a set for Nelson so that we don't have to have another operation to install it," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I'll have someone customize my son's hearing aid," said Martin Weiss as he took two steps forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned, but Martin Weiss was the biological father, so she could not stop him from customizing a hearing aid for Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn had gradually calmed down after crying and venting out her emotions. She got up and said to Grace, "Thank you, Grace. You don't have to bother about the hearing aid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want any more conflicts over the hearing aid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. "Jay and I will send you home, then." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after she said this, Martin Weiss said, "I can send them home, so don't bother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Martin Weiss bent over and picked up Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one stared at the man he had only met a few times before. He knew he was his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart yearned for a father, so when Martin Weiss picked him up, he did not resist and even felt a little happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Daddy's here. Does this mean he'll protect Mommy with me and not let Mommy cry anymore?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew his mother would be sad every time he got into a fight and was injured. However, he did not like it when those kids called his mother a bad person. His mother was nice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss left with Nelson in his arms, while Kyla Corbyn could only quickly say goodbye to Grace and followed after them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching the backs of the three as they left, Grace only found her eyes feeling sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Why are your eyes red?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just feeling... emotional. They could have been a happy family of three, but they turned out like this. Do you think Martin Weiss has ever loved Kyla?" murmured Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Jason gave an affirmative answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can you be so sure?" Grace asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can tell from the way he looks at Kyla Corbyn. Maybe he just doesn't know it yet," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People tended to be like that. Perhaps others could see it clearly, but they themselves had no idea.</p></div>
