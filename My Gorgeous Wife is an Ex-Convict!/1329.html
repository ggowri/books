        <h1>Chapter 1328</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time Kyla Corbyn was done talking, Mrs. Corbyn was already crying her eyes out as she hugged her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn gently patted her mother on the back and comforted her softly, "Mom, don't cry. Don't cry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not her son who worried her the most, but her mother. Her mother had devoted so much to her, but as a daughter, she could not even provide for her old mother until the end of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn went to a nearby market to buy some ingredients for the food stall, and she happened to run into Chase Harper on her way back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper was happy to see Kyla Corbyn. "What a coincidence. I was afraid no one would be at home when I got there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing here?" asked Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I happened to have something to do nearby, so I came to drop off some toys. They're toys from my childhood, but they're still in good condition. Nelson was interested when I told him about them, so I wanted to give them to him. You can just throw them away when they're worn out. They're only trinkets of little value anyway," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," Kyla Corbyn thanked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you carrying these things upstairs? Let me help you!" Seeing the ingredients on Kyla Corbyn's motorcycle, Chase Harper rolled up his sleeves and helped carry them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn thanked him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they carried the things upstairs, they did not notice a car that was parked not far away. The person in the car was looking at the scene with a dark gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper did not stay very long. He only put down the toys he brought, chatted a little, and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said, "I'll send you downstairs. I have to go down and clean up the food stall cart anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the two went downstairs and Chase Harper asked somewhat hesitantly, "Grace... How is she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's fine. She's getting along well with Jason. The babies are due in a few months," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A hint of gloom flashed across Chase Harper's face, but he still said sincerely, "As long as she's okay." She was the woman he really liked. He also hoped that her hard times were over and she could truly be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at his gloomy appearance, raised her hand, and gently patted his shoulder. "You're a good man, and you'll find a good woman!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope so." Chase Harper touched his nose mockingly. "What about you? When are you going to find a father for Nelson? It's too tiring for a woman to take care of a child alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn smiled gently and said nothing. 'Find a father for Nelson? I'll never get the chance to do that.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper looked at Kyla Corbyn's smile under the sun and could not help being a little stunned. He only felt that her smile was fragile and empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He even felt as though the person in front of him was about to melt into foam and disappear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" He did not come back to his senses until Kyla Corbyn's voice rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He quickly pulled himself together and hurriedly said, "No-Nothing. I'm going home. Just call me if there's anything I can do for you."</p></div>
