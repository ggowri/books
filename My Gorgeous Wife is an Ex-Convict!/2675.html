        <h1>Chapter 2673</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda Theller only said indifferently, "You don't have to tell me this. I have a boyfriend now. You can have Raymond Bowman if you want. I don't like him at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman's expression froze. "You have a boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller chuckled. "Miss Li, you wouldn&rsquo;t think I still liked Raymond Bowman after so many years, would you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman's gorgeous face twisted slightly. She wanted to humiliate Valda Theller, but now, it felt like she was the one who was humiliated instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Raymond Bowman hurried over. After seeing the two of them, he rushed straight over. "Barbara Schuman, what are you doing to Valda Theller? I told you to leave her alone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman's red lips smiled. "I just wanted to say hello to Valda. Why are you so worried? By the way, Valda told me that she has a boyfriend. Raymond Bowman, you're wasting your time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's expression changed slightly. "I know she has a boyfriend, so what?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman's eyes froze slightly, and surprise flashed across her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller ignored the two and walked past them. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman wanted to talk to Valda Theller again, but some things were inappropriate to say in front of Barbara Schuman. Therefore, he could only reluctantly watch Valda Theller leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman saw the reluctance in his eyes, which made her jealous and unwilling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why did the man who liked me back then like Valda Theller now? Am I no match for Valda Theller? Besides being better at drawing comics, what else is she better at than me? So what if she's good at drawing comics? She doesn&rsquo;t make much money!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does an orphan deserve to contend with me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Raymond Bowman, I thought Valda Theller was still devoted to you. Who knew... Haha..." Barbara Schuman laughed mockingly. "She already has a boyfriend. She seems to despise you, yet you&rsquo;ve fallen in love with her. What a joke!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shut up!" Raymond Bowman roared. Those black eyes glowed ferociously like an angry beast ready to rip her open!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman was shocked by the glow in Raymond Bowman's eyes. The way he looked at her now was unlike how he had looked at her previously. It was as if he was looking at an enemy. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what if I'm a joke? I was already a joke when I was in cahoots with you! Barbara Schuman, I'm warning you. I won't go easy on you if you lay a finger on Valda Theller!" He threatened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quivered. His expression and tone told her that he was not just saying it. He really meant what he said. "Do you... love Valda Theller that much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Love... I love her, I guess? But I don't know how deep is my love for her.&rsquo; All he knew was that he did not want to repeat the same mistakes he made back then and hurt the innocent woman again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman bit his red lip slightly and hugged Raymond Bowman suddenly. "Raymond Bowman, you love me. What you have for Valda Theller is nothing but temporary sympathy. You were willing to do everything for me back then. How could such love fade easily? I'm right here with you. If you want..."</p></div>
