        <h1>Chapter 3871</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there a law that says if you put a book on a table, you have the exclusive right to use the whole table and others can't use it?" Veronica spoke up. "These tables and chairs are for the restaurant's public use. The restaurant never said you could use things to reserve seats."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Reserving seats with things is an established custom," the girl said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Custom?" Veronica sneered. "Just because it's a custom doesn't mean it's right. Besides, if you can occupy a whole table with just one book, can I occupy the whole restaurant with several books?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other girl's face turned red. "You're just being tricky!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've made myself clear! Besides, we didn't even sit where you put your books. There are empty seats, so if you want to sit, sit there. If not, then leave. We still need to eat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The girl was so angry that she trembled all over. She took a step forward and grabbed Veronica's hand, "Get up! Why are you eating at our seat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With this pull, the knife and fork in Veronica's hand fell directly to the ground, and some of the food on the plate also splashed on her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you doing!" Shirley suddenly stood up and shouted at the girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, two more boys walked over, "What's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The girl who had a conflict with Veronica immediately complained, "These two girls took our seats. I have already put my books on the table, but they still shamelessly sat down!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of the boys said, "Forget it, you sit here, Cato Wit and I will go find another seat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, they have to leave!" The girl seemed to want to confront Veronica and insisted on not giving in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why should we leave? Is this seat with your name on it? Did you buy it?" Shirley exclaimed indignantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cato, who was called, was the girlfriend of the girl who had a dispute with Veronica and Shirley. When he saw his girlfriend looking so wronged, he immediately frowned and said to Veronica and Shirley, "Okay, you can leave now with your food. Let's pretend this never happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tone was like ordering people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This meal was eaten with anger. Veronica felt her stomach churning and felt uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suppressed this uncomfortable feeling and said, "As long as you leave now and apologize to me for pulling and dirtying my clothes earlier, then I can pretend this never happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica pointed to the girl who caused the trouble as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You see, she's still saying that!" The girl turned to Cato, as if she had suffered a great grievance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cato naturally wanted to stand up for his girlfriend, so he said to Veronica, "Really? Okay then, since your clothes are already dirty, why not make them even dirtier!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Saying that, he picked up a bowl of soup in front of Veronica and splashed it towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, Veronica was already on guard while speaking and immediately dodged to the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, because she was sitting on a chair, her clothes were still partially splashed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, are you okay? Is it serious?!" Shirley quickly got up and approached Veronica, asking worriedly.</p></div>
