        <h1>Chapter 3232</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her current life is the calm and peaceful one she had always hoped for, and Nelson has gradually accepted Martin. They live a peaceful and warm family life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she releases the hypnosis, this peace may be shattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But if she doesn't release the hypnosis, it's like an unpredictable bomb that will always be there. She doesn't know if she will accidentally say the hypnotic release code and unexpectedly release the hypnosis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And then what will happen? She doesn't know! She's also afraid to think about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this a very important matter?" Amber asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's very important," Kyla said. "If we don't do it, things may stay the same forever, or something unexpected may happen someday. But if we do it, things may change immediately, but at least we can be mentally prepared and choose the right time, so we won't be caught off guard."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So it's like being proactive or waiting passively, like a bomb. Are you going to detonate it actively or wait for it to explode passively?" Amber said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You described it very well," Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can only say that if it's really like a bomb, detonating it voluntarily may not necessarily harm oneself, but if it's stepped on passively, then it will definitely cause harm," said Amber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla is lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, the doorbell rang and Amber got up to answer it. She was surprised to see Valda and Brian standing outside. "When did you guys come back?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yesterday," Valda smiled and said, "I saw my godmother downstairs and thought of coming upstairs to see if you were asleep. If you weren't, I wanted to give you a gift."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She spoke and handed over the gift. Amber took it and said, "Thanks. By the way, Kyla is also here with me today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda and Brian entered Amber's room. Kyla stood up and said, "Oh, it's you guys. I was wondering who could be visiting Amber so late at night." Kyla smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda said, "If I had known that you were here today, Kyla, I would have brought the gift with me. I'll have to come find you another day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Welcome," Kyla said, looking at Valda's happy smile and couldn't help but exclaim, "Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, Valda, you're already married to Brian. I can still remember the first time I met you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda touched her nose and smiled, saying, "Back then, I never thought that one day I would actually marry Brian. But as the saying goes, happiness is something you have to fight for yourself. Luckily, I had thick skin back then, otherwise I might have missed out on Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked slightly embarrassed on the side, after all, as a man, he didn't have much say in front of three women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla watched Valda's happy face and Brian's gentle expression, and felt something stir within her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, happiness is something that we have to strive for ourselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda pursued happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So what about her? Can she also strive for true, worry-free happiness?</p></div>
