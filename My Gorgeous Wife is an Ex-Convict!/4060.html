        <h1>Chapter 4058</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina slowly raised her hand and stroked Chandler's lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His lips were very beautiful. Although they were thin, the lines of his lips were distinct, giving people a feeling of exquisite craftsmanship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pale watery rose color exudes a tempting feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover...the feeling of touching it with her fingers is softer and more...um, comfortable than she imagined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina, like a curious child, began to stroke Chandler's lips with her fingers back and forth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> For her, it was just curiosity, but for him, it was more like a stimulation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Once upon a time, the physical contact between them became more and more like a tease for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Or perhaps it should be said that his self-control in front of her was becoming weaker and weaker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "How long do you plan on playing like this? If you continue to do so..." As his voice trailed off, his pitch-black and profound eyes slowly opened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Wait!" Tina was startled when she saw him open his eyes, and without thinking, she raised her other hand and covered his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Suddenly, Chandler's vision turned into darkness again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, he didn't move or remove her hand. He just let her continue to cover his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I...I'm not playing. I just want to...get familiar with your lips first." She made an excuse, feeling embarrassed to say that she just couldn't get enough of the feel of his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Are you familiar now?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, I am. Hehe...don't open your eyes, I'm going to kiss you now." She giggled nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Okay," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She then moved her hand away from his eyes, took a deep breath, and kissed his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As their lips touched, her mind became blank, and all she could hear was her own breathing and heartbeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was so rapid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even when the kiss ended, Tina was still in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's voice interrupted her reverie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Done?" Chandler asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Huh?" She blinked. Was that... a kiss just now? Well, their lips did touch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But it was just a touch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> That kiss couldn't be called a lover's kiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina saw Chandler's eyelashes fluttering, as if he was about to open his eyes. "Don't open your eyes yet, it's not done! That didn't count, let me try again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Try again?" Chandler's voice sounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, try again." She was too nervous just now and didn't feel anything during the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But one thing was certain... she liked kissing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler didn't say anything else and didn't open his eyes. He just leaned against the couch with his eyes closed, looking like he was asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina felt her heart still beating fast, but at least this time, she wasn't completely blank like the last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She leaned in and her lips slowly approached his, feeling his breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was strange, but at that moment, even his breath seemed sweet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Their lips met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was a warm feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gently rubbing, then following the kissing techniques she had seen in movies and TV shows, she pried open his lips with her tongue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought this action would require a lot of effort, but in fact, it was quite easy.</p></div>
