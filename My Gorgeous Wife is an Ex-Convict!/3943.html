        <h1>Chapter 3941</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After seeing Mick come out, Nancy put down her glass and stood up, feeling a bit uneasy. "You... have you finished washing up? Then let's... hic... go to bed..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She murmured, feeling like she wasn't as nervous after drinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she walked up to Mick, trying to remember how intimate scenes between men and women were portrayed in movies and TV shows, and what a woman should say if she wanted to take the initiative.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The effects of alcohol made Nancy lose her previous restraint, and she became more casual in her behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy began to pull at Mick's bathrobe, and one hand even slipped inside, touching his skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick raised an eyebrow. The last woman who tried to touch him had her hand broken by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's movements were extremely clumsy, but they didn't disgust him. In fact, the places she touched him made him feel a rush of blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did his physical reaction mean that he had feelings for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking this, Mick's eyes became deeper. "Why did you drink?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was... afraid... afraid of being nervous... and not performing well..." she slurred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she were still sober, she would have used different words, but she overestimated her alcohol tolerance. Now that she was drunk, she spoke without thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, even though she was drunk, she still remembered her goal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Performing well?" Mick couldn't help but laugh. It was the first time a woman had said something like this to him. "Do you think your performance is good now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will... try to make you comfortable, so... so... don't dislike me..." As she finished speaking, she pulled open his bathrobe and kissed his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's body suddenly stiffened. This feeling was somewhat unfamiliar to him and made him a little uneasy, as if some kind of balance was about to be disrupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kiss after kiss, she showered them on his chest, collarbone, and shoulders... as if igniting a fire within him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she kissed him, she kept murmuring, "Don't... don't dislike me... I'll do well, I'll... make you happy..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick lowered his eyes and looked at the flushed and blurry-eyed woman. Even if she was drunk, did she still want him to like her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words seemed to place herself in a humble position, as if she would do anything to gain his affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because she really liked him, as she said, or was there something else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, too many women desired him, not only as a person, but also for the Reed family behind him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really want me to like you?" he asked in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course... I want you to like me... I really like you... hiccup... me!" She said, raising her head, wrapping her arms around his neck, and then pressing her lips hard against his.</p></div>
