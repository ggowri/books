        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, tell me!" she said. Actually, she didn't care whether he would hate her or the Reed family, she just wanted to make him feel better through her compensation, to make him happier in his life instead of being immersed in that pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Date me too, what do you say?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly widened her eyes, full of surprise. "What did you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can date William, why can't you date me too? I can promise you that we can secretly date, and our relationship won't be discovered by anyone, including William," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Secretly...dating you?" She stared at him. "Didn't you used to mock me for wanting to have my cake and eat it too? Now what, you're actively asking me to have my cake and eat it too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I can be one of your options. That way, you can compare and see how much you really feel for William, right?" Lawrence said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper furrowed her brows. "I don't like comparing feelings, and I'm not interested in having two options. I'll just pretend I didn't hear what you said today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, she turned around and intended to open the door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want to compensate me?" He suddenly grabbed her hand, stopping her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do, but not in this way," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But isn't using feelings to compensate for emotional harm the best way?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what? If I secretly date you, but in the end, I choose to be with William for life, won't you be hurt? Your so-called compensation is just causing you to be hurt again," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her stern words made his heart ache as if it had been pricked by something again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he said, "No, I won't be hurt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly laughed. "If you won't be hurt, then it can only mean that you don't have those feelings for me. If you don't have them, why bother dating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." He stared at her, not knowing what to say next.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No feelings? Did he really not have feelings for her? This sentence was like a self-</span><span>deceiving lie. He could deceive himself, but...why was she so easily deceived by him? Why couldn't she see through his lie?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or maybe she actually knew it was a lie, but didn't want to expose it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because it's better to avoid unnecessary trouble?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper left the room and changed back into her own clothes, removed her makeup, and called William, "William, where are you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look up, you can see me," William's gentle voice came from the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked up and saw the familiar figure standing not far away, waiting for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How long had he been waiting here?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that he was always waiting for her unintentionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like their relationship, he was waiting for her to understand her feelings for him. He wouldn't force her, but instead gave her the choice to make.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would always respect everything about her, comfort her when she was down, and be happy with her when she was happy.</span></p></div>
