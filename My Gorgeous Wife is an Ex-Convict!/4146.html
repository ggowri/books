        <h1>Chapter 4144</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina blinked her eyes and asked, "Then what should it be? What should it be?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler pursed his thin lips and didn't answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was Tina who raised her hands and wrapped them around Chandler's neck. "I only saw Kit as an idol because I thought he was hardworking and talented. He shouldn't be treated like that. I think I can help him, at least I want to make sure he doesn't experience things like today in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She paused and said, "It's just that fans hope their idols can live a better life. Can't you understand this kind of feeling?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler's gaze flickered slightly. It was indeed hard for him to understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He had never been a fan of anyone, and he didn't really understand the emotions fans had for their idols. But he could try to understand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But are you jealous again?" Tina looked at Chandler and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Jealous...right, because of her sympathy, because of her understanding of the fans' feelings towards idols.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "If I say yes, what would you do?" he asked in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I will tell you over and over again that I love you, and then, with my actions..." she said, standing on tiptoe and taking the initiative to kiss his lips, "No matter how many idol stars I may like, it's just admiration. Maybe I admire their singing, their dancing, their performance, their acting...but I know that's different from love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina tried to deepen the kiss. It seemed like he was becoming more and more jealous. Did that mean he loved her more and more?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Chandler, the person I love is you, and I think that will never change." Because she was the one he saw when he was born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because he had been by her side throughout her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> There were so many reasons, so...her love for him was so natural!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit returned to his private apartment with his manager.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What happened today? How did you end up with the Hunter family and Miss Stephenson?" the manager asked, startled when he received Kit's call asking him to pick someone up at Chandler's villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I happened to meet them at today's dinner." Kit said, sounding tired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But what about the injuries on your face? How did you end up at the Hunter family's villa?" the manager still found it strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "The injuries on my face had nothing to do with them. I was injured by someone else, and...I messed up with the resources. There won't be any more resources." Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The manager hesitated, as if wanting to say something, but looking at the injuries on Kit's face and his exhausted appearance, he finally said, "Rest well. I'll clear your schedule for the next two days so you can recover."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Okay." Kit nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After the manager left, he wearily lay back on the sofa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Closing his eyes, flashes of today's scenes appeared in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He had already resigned himself to it. Even if it was dirty, he had accepted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But she burst in like that, saw his most embarrassing scene, and became his hero, rescuing him from despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Is it redemption?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But if she really is his redemption, why did she appear so late? And why does she already have someone else by her side?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just then, the phone rang, breaking the silence in the room!</p></div>
