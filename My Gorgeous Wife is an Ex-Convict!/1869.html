        <h1>Chapter 1867</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts had a fever! However, Grace had no idea what was going on, let alone where her mentor and his wife were!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, a voice suddenly rang in her ears. &ldquo;Did you have a nightmare?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace instantly froze, only feeling a shadow approaching her. She stared blankly at the person in front of her. It was Jay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the room was dim at the moment. She could only see his figure but not his expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What did you dream about?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"N-Nothing. I don't remember much," she said vaguely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Really?' His eyes glimmered in the dark. He raised his hand to gently stroke her cheek. He knew what she had dreamt about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She dreamed of him, that woman, and her mentor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could hear her calling his name, her mentor&rsquo;s name, and... that woman&rsquo;s name in her dream!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm sorry I woke you up. I'll go wash my face," said Grace as she threw off the covers and went to the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She closed the bathroom door and looked at the mirror in front of the sink. Looking at the reflection in the mirror, she was ghastly pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Maybe she should be glad it was dark enough that they could not see each other's faces earlier, or maybe she would have had a real breakdown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts's kindness to her flashed through her mind. The person she once considered her mother was the one who hurt Jay the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What should she do to get the best of both worlds?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She seemed to be stuck in between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah..." She instantly burst into tears. She bit her lip and tried to suppress her crying, fearing that Jason would hear her from outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Boo-hoo&hellip; Boo-hoo..." The sobs and repressed cries rang out in the bathroom. Grace leaned over the sink as she shed tears. It was as if she wanted to vent all her struggles and pain over the past few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How did this happen... What should I do... What on earth should I do..." she kept saying, but there was no answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What she did not know was that Jason was leaning against the bathroom door outside, frowning slightly as he slowly clenched his hands at his sides.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does she care that much about that woman? Does she know even if she&rsquo;s not pleading, every look she gives me and every time she tries to speak but ultimately stops herself is like a plea?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, are you going to betray me?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Grace came out of the bathroom, the lights in the room were on. Jason was sitting on the couch next to their bed, talking on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let her lay there. Take her straight to the police station if she takes one step out of there. Otherwise, she deserves it even if she dies there," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze and asked urgently, "Is Mrs. Watts's fever getting worse?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason glanced up at Grace, tapped the end call button on his phone, and said lightly, "Didn't we agree not to talk about these things again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, how is Mrs. Watts doing?" asked Grace as her eyes turned red. She had managed to wipe the tears off her face in the bathroom, but now they seemed to come pouring out again.</p></div>
