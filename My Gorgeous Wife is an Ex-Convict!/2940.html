        <h1>Chapter 2938</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was lost in thought, wondering if it was possible for her to replace Grace in Brian Hart's heart if given enough time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you believe that Brian Hart cannot fall in love with you, then how long do you think it will take for him to find someone he truly loves? After being rejected by Grace, it took him so many years to find you. So now, after you reject him, how long will it take for him to find the person you speak of? Ten years? Twenty years? Or will he never find them? Valda Theller, how many years do you think you have left in your life?" Patrick Weiss's words felt like heavy stones pressing on Valda Theller's chest, making it hard for her to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, I still believe that you are the only one who can pull Brian Hart out of his despair, and he is the person you cannot afford to miss in your life. If you miss him because of your own arrogance, I bet you will regret it for the rest of your life!" Patrick Weiss said with conviction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's gaze fell on Brian Hart, who was still sleeping on the hospital bed, and she remained silent for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">---</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian Hart woke up, he only saw Patrick Weiss in his hospital room, but not Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where is Valda Theller?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, she said she went back," Patrick Weiss lazily replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart's eyelashes trembled slightly, and his phoenix eyes lowered. She went back... it was only natural for her to leave after taking care of him for two days. Besides, he didn't want her to stay just out of a sense of duty, did he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she had gone back, wasn't it better this way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But there was a faint feeling of pain in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you seem upset when you hear that Valda Theller has left? If you want her to come back, why don't I call her right away?" Patrick Weiss said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need," Brian Hart said, looking up at Patrick Weiss. "Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, to visit a patient," Patrick Weiss said. "You were injured so badly, and you didn't even tell me. If I hadn't run into your parents, I wouldn't have known about it until you were discharged."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a minor injury," Brian Hart said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, a minor injury that required eleven stitches," Patrick Weiss retorted. "You're so reluctant to let Valda Theller get hurt that you'd rather take the hit yourself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pursed his thin lips and murmured after a while, "Yes, I am reluctant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You-" Patrick Weiss paused. "By the way, have you fallen in love with Valda Theller? If a man is willing to take a stab for a woman, it's safe to say he's in love, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart remained silent for a while before slowly saying, "I don't know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could you not know? Didn't you love Grace?" Patrick Weiss asked, puzzled.</p></div>
