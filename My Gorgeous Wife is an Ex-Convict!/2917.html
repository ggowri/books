        <h1>Chapter 2915</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman trembled with fear after the wrap party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That day, she spilled wine all over Brian Hart and his warning still echoed in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Schuman family was in chaos, with her parents constantly scolding her and blaming each other for spoiling her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her father even slapped her directly to the ground, "Do you know who you have offended? Do you think just because we are The Schuman family, you can do whatever you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I just can't stand that Valda Theller. Even if Brian Hart is protecting her now, so what? Someone like Valda Theller is just a passing fancy for Brian Hart. I'll just try to avoid being in the same place as him in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're talking so lightly. Do you know that The Cross Family is about to collapse because of Brian Hart?!" Mr. Lee said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Cross Family?" Barbara Schuman was puzzled. "Which Cross Family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Cross Group," Mrs. Li said. "I heard that The Cross Family offended Brian Hart because of a woman, so Brian Hart is now targeting The Cross Family. The Cross Family's funding chain has already been completely broken, and it may not last much longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman couldn't believe her eyes. Just because of offending a woman, The Cross Family was going to collapse?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could that woman be Valda Theller? The thought made her shiver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Impossible! It couldn't be Valda Theller!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But then The Schuman family's funding chain also began to have problems, and the bank wanted to withdraw their loan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman was completely panicked. It was really because of Valda Theller! Brian Hart had done all this just for Valda Theller!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman used all her tricks to find out that Brian Hart would attend a certain banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So she hurried there, but without an invitation, she could only wait outside the banquet for Brian Hart to appear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, inside the banquet, Patrick Weiss looked at Brian Hart's bored face and asked, "If you find this kind of banquet boring, why did you come?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Being alone sometimes leads to overthinking, so it's better to come out and distract myself," Brian Hart lazily replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Overthinking?" Patrick Weiss raised an eyebrow with interest. "What are you overthinking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart gently turned the wine glass in his hand and didn't answer. His overthinking was all about Valda Theller...thinking about the things he had experienced with her, and what he thought about the most was the scene where he saw her being attacked and insulted by others at the comic convention, and he turned and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when he had midnight dreams, he often woke up because of this scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This scene was a nightmare for Valda Theller, but wasn't it also a nightmare for him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thinking about Valda Theller again?" Seeing his friend's expression, Patrick Weiss guessed, "You are Brian Hart, and yet you can't handle an ordinary woman like her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's not an ordinary woman," Brian Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You used to have a lot of girlfriends, and they all loved you to death. This Valda Theller also seems to love you a lot. Just use a few tricks, and she will be willing to come back to you," Patrick Weiss said.</p></div>
