        <h1>Chapter 2212</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you want me to live?" His eyes sparkled as if they were covered with a layer of starlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze. The light in his eyes made her unable to look directly at him, and she could only vaguely say, "Whatever floats your boat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want me to live, then I'll live. No matter how hard it is, I'll live!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had thought that she did not care about his life and might even wish he was dead. However, she did not want anything to happen to him. Even though she said it was only because of the children, it was something that could keep him going.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Call your driver and ask him to pick you up," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah, okay," he answered, took out his phone, and dialed the driver's number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he finished the call moments later, he heard her voice ring out again. "My neighbor told me that you've been driving over and looking at the store these days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Bewilderment flashed across his face. He looked like a student caught by a teacher for doing something wrong. "I... I just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I just want to see more of her, even if it's just a glance.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If there's no particular reason, I'd rather you not do it again. Do you think you're not disturbing me by doing this? Your behavior is already a disturbance. If the neighbors keep seeing you, they&rsquo;ll start to speculate. That&rsquo;ll turn into all kinds of gossip. I don't want my family to be troubled by these rumors," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face grew paler, and he was about to lose his grip on the glass of water in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla suddenly smiled. "Martin Weiss, spare me as well as yourself. We're not a good fit for each other. Can't you see that? We've known each other for years, but the times we've spent in happiness can&rsquo;t be compared to the times we were in pain, so why choose to remain in pain?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's hands gripped the glass in his hands. "Pain... That was because I didn't know right from wrong and I didn&rsquo;t know how to cherish you. But it&rsquo;s not like that anymore. I won't do that anymore. I'll try my best to be a good husband and father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I don't want to go through that agonizing pain again! Martin Weiss, I'm past the impulsive stage of youth. I don't have the courage anymore! I don't want to experience that disappointment again. It's... so agonizing. It's like the world is turning gloomy right before my eyes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do my feelings hurt you that much?" he murmured, his voice trembling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She replied, "Yes... Your feelings even scare me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Scare?" He gave a bitter laugh. "Haha... I thought... I love you, so I wanted to make up for the harm I've caused you, but... it turns out you're scared... You&rsquo;re scared..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers pressed harder and harder on the glass. With a crack, the glass in his hand suddenly broke into pieces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla exclaimed, "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked indifferently at his hands that were covered in blood. The broken glass shards had cut his hands quite a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Strangely enough, he felt no pain at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing Martin Weiss's bleeding hands, Kyla hurried to rummage through the medical kit.</p></div>
