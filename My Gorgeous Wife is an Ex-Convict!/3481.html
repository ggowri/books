        <h1>Chapter 3479</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Jasper suddenly swayed slightly and his expression changed abruptly. "Wait, something's not right. There's a strange smell in this room..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper hurriedly walked towards the door of the private room and tried to open it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the door was locked from the outside, so it couldn't be opened. Jasper exclaimed, "What's going on? Why won't the door open?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel knew exactly what had happened. He knew that the people who pretended to kidnap Veronica were hired by him. He had previously stated that if Veronica refused to drink the drugged water, they would use gas to knock her out and lock the door of the compartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Jasper about to take out his phone, Lionel immediately snatched it from Jasper's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica frowned, "Lionel, what are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Give me back my phone!" Jasper seemed to have realized something and tried to rush over to grab the phone. However, after taking a few steps, she stumbled and fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica is now clearly feeling unwell, as if she could fall asleep at any moment. She staggers towards Lionel and asks him in a stern voice, "Lionel, what is going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sister... um... I don't know either, I..." Lionel suddenly rolled his eyes and pretended to faint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica struggled to take out her phone and call for help, but as she finally managed to retrieve it, her fingers suddenly lost their strength and the phone slipped from her grasp. In the next moment, she collapsed onto the carpeted floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, Lionel opened his eyes and stood up again. "Sis, I did it all for you, for the good of our Barlow family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This special gas was secretly released by him after they entered the private room and refused to drink water. He had taken an antidote beforehand, so he was naturally unaffected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel walked over to the door of the private room and knocked rhythmically. The door opened immediately. The young men inside had already changed into the uniforms of the cleaning staff. Lionel put Jasper and Veronica into the prepared cleaning bucket, and the young men quietly left through the back door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, outside, cars were already waiting to pick them up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the way, Lionel anxiously asked, "Did you really destroy all the surveillance cameras?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, we definitely have to destroy it, otherwise we'll be easily caught, right? But we got lucky today. You just said that these two women, one is your sister and the other is Jasper from the Reed family," one of them said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, she's one of the triplets from the Reed family," Lionel said. "I never thought she would come along with my sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"With Jasper from the Reed family in hand, it should be even more certain to obtain the ransom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, how much ransom would be appropriate? Even a few billion would do!"</p></div>
