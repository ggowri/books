        <h1>Chapter 586</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together. He would never give Brian that chance!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the private room, Brian pulled the platinum necklace from his neck that had a small silver bracelet hanging from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers gently rubbed against the bracelet which had been polished by him over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bracelet was like the whole world to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that the world had an affection that was so profound it could become heavier and heavier as it precipitated in bone and blood as time passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Cut!" The director once again stopped the filming. He looked sullenly at Evelyn as he said, "What's the matter with you? I just want you to look sad after your mother's death. Is it so difficult to perform such a simple act? It's not like you've only been an actor for a year or two..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Listening to the director's criticisms, Evelyn could only nod her head in response. She felt a sense of resentment in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director had been obedient to her in the past. All her scenes were done in one shot. Unless she asked for a reshoot, the director dared not say anything bad about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, all the director did was point his finger at her head as he scolded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All the other actors around them looked at Evelyn with sarcasm and disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Evelyn rekindled her mood for the scene, she heard other actresses sarcastically saying, "She doesn&rsquo;t have acting skills nor good looks, yet she has the guts to become the female lead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, she used to be so lucky, being the crown prince's girlfriend and all. She thought she could marry into a rich and powerful family, but now, the crown prince has kicked her aside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The crown prince probably found her too disgusting. She deliberately framed her own sister! It's all right if she embarrassed herself, but now she's ruining the whole crew!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fortunately, the director has compressed her parts, or we'll have to dismiss the crew!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was exasperated, but she could not do anything to defend herself in the face of these claims. She wanted to make a comeback with this drama, but now the production team had severely compressed her parts. The scriptwriter even rewrote the script, making her parts less than a third of what it originally was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In order to complete the drama smoothly so that she did not have to pay the penalty for breach of contract, she had to repeatedly endure the others' ridicules and taunts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They used to flatter her all the time, but they suddenly turned hostile and were now kicking her when she was down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was worse was that the numerous advertisements she had signed with wanted to cancel their contracts because of her scandal. Due to that, she had to pay for the breach of contract.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would only have enough money to pay if she compensated with all the houses, jewelry, branded goods, and money she got from Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that meant she would have nothing left!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could she be content with that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace... If it were not for Grace... Evelyn felt even more hatred at the thought of this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During the filming, someone came to the set. Evelyn was very surprised to see the man. He was one of Brian's men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man went up to the director. After a few words with him, he went up to Evelyn. "Mr. Hart wants to see you, Miss Cummins."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn looked joyous.</p></div>
