        <h1>Chapter 2444</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over the years, Kyla had always been forbearing and did not enjoy any attention. However, she stood out in front of the police and a bunch of press with her huge baby bump. She said confidently, "I'm willing to bear any legal responsibility, but before that, I hope my friend Amber Mitchell can be given a fair evaluation to determine if she's sick and if the Mitchell family, who are supposed to be her family, are even treating her well!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was accusing the Mitchell family, and the cameras instantly focused on Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is Amber Mitchell really suffering from mental illness?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you have to say about her statement?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In the video, Amber Mitchell seems to have lost a finger on her right hand. I remember that her fingers were intact before she was admitted to the mental hospital. How did she lose it?" A sharp-eyed reporter in the room asked. It had caused a stir in the news when Amber Mitchell was sent to the mental hospital, and many reporters remembered the incident well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was nervous as she faced these aggressive questions. However, she spoke calmly to the reporters before her, "If the person who filmed this video is calling it proof when Amber Mitchell is only remaining motionless, then I only have one thing to say. That is, I&rsquo;ll sue the person slandering me using the law!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Louise Mitchell looked at Captain Wang again. "Do the police allow such people to slander the Mitchell family? My sister is in there, yet the police aren&rsquo;t doing anything.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Captain Wang looked at the crowd of media here. If something happened to Amber Mitchell when the video was over, the police would probably have to take the blame again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All they had to do now was get Amber Mitchell out first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Captain Wang ordered his police officers to break through the human barrier in front of them to enter. Suddenly, a reporter screamed, and more people followed suit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the video, Amber Mitchell was looking up. There was a glimmer of light in her dark eyes. It was because... she had seen some hope!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hoarse voice said... "Help... me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, anyone would think that she was clear-headed and not a mental patient. She had mustered up all her strength to say the two words &lsquo;help me&rsquo;!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No way. Did the Mitchell family really force a normal person to stay in a mental hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When Amber Mitchell was sent to the mental hospital, there were rumors the Mitchell family did it to seize her shares in the company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But isn&rsquo;t the Mitchell family her family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Humans die in pursuit of wealth, and birds die in pursuit of food. Even family can't resist wealth. Besides, Amber Mitchell's mother died a long time ago. The second heiress of the Mitchell family and Amber Mitchell don&rsquo;t share the same mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's face increasingly paled as people kept whispering around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the video had finished playing, the computer expert deliberately paused at the last scene when Amber Mitchell looked up and said the words &lsquo;help me&rsquo;. Her eyes were full of pain and suffering but with a glimmer of hope. It was enough to move many people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell suddenly shouted, "Captain Wang, are you done watching the video now? I want you to get my sister out of there now!&rdquo; </p></div>
