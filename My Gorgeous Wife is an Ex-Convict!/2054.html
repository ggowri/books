        <h1>Chapter 2052</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss frowned even more and sneered. "What's the matter? Do you want to be with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper said, "It's none of your business whether I want to be with her, Mr. Weiss. I'm single, and she's single. It's up to me and her whether we want to be with each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's expression changed slightly. Kyla had said something similar. She said whether or not she got together with Chase Harper was up to her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For a moment, it was as if he had been cast aside from them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly got up and grabbed Chase Harper's collar. "I'm telling you, you can forget about being with Kyla!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is it because you love her?" asked Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's face was cold as he pursed his lips without saying a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you love her, why make her live such a hard life? Don't you know how tiring it is for a woman to run a small store while looking after an elderly mother and a small child?&rdquo; asked Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's face became more gloomy, and his fingers on Chase Harper's collar clenched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He understood what Chase Harper said, but...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Even if it&rsquo;s not me, someone else will notice a good woman like Kyla. Are you going to 'talk' to everybody like this?" added Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss instantly pushed Chase Harper away. "What do you know? You know nothing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper awkwardly knocked down a chair and fell to the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He staggered to his feet and looked at him calmly. "I know nothing, but at least I know I should make the woman I love happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Chase Harper fixed his clothes. "I think I've figured out why you're here today, Mr. Weiss. You must have figured out where I stand too. Whatever happens between Kyla and me, we don&rsquo;t need your permission."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Chase Harper walked out of the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew Martin Weiss was a high and mighty heir, while he was only a small shop owner and an ordinary person in tMason Swansonty. If Martin Weiss wanted to do anything to him, there was no room for him to resist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps he should immediately distance himself from Kyla and promise not to have anything to do with her again. It was probably the most sensible way to save himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he said what he said anyway. Perhaps it was because he did not want to be a coward anymore. His wife had cheated on him with his best friend. When he saw the two of them making out, he said nothing but left cowardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His cowardice that time had become his trauma. He did nothing wrong, but he was like a loser.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not want himself to experience another trauma. He did not want to look back on this and think he did not behave like a f*cking man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Led by Mrs. Corbyn, Nelson Corbyn went to the taekwondo training institution after school to learn taekwondo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla found the training institution for her son after finding out her son was often bullied at school. Her son could exercise and at the same time, gain the ability to protect himself.</p></div>
