        <h1>Chapter 4021</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of this child, she was given hope and courage to live on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what if something happens? The doctor has already determined that your body is not suitable for childbirth!" His voice unintentionally grew louder, and his worst fears seemed to be becoming a reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I will bear the consequences myself!" Nancy said with determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're just..." Mick impatiently stood up, not knowing what to do with her stubbornness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He should have known that she wasn't someone who could be easily persuaded!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Regardless, this child must not be aborted!" he concluded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whether or not to have an abortion should be my decision!" Nancy insisted. "I won't have an abortion. As long as I'm alive, the child will live too. Unless I die, I will safely give birth to this child!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The word "die" seemed to trigger something in Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes suddenly turned red. "Do you know what you're saying? How can you die?! How can you?! I won't allow you to die, I won't!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't want to discuss this with you anymore. You have no right to decide the fate of this child," Nancy said, not wanting to continue the conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I absolutely won't allow you to die! So you can't keep this child, you can't!" Mick grabbed Nancy's shoulders, as if he had fallen into some kind of madness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ouch!" She cried out in pain. Her shoulder was already injured, and the pain quickly spread when he grabbed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's face turned pale, and she tried to break free from his grasp, but she had no way to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, promise me, you won't die. Promise me, don't keep this child. Promise me, you promise me!" Mick persisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let go... let go..." Nancy struggled to say, "Mick... please let go, my shoulder... it hurts so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Promise me, promise me!" He was still begging for an answer from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Nancy seemed unable to bear the pain in her shoulder any longer and suddenly fainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy! Nancy!" It was only then that Mick came to his senses, shouting her name desperately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she didn't respond at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside the ward, the bodyguard, upon hearing Mick's cries, quickly opened the door to take a look and called for the doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the Reed family arrived after hearing the news, the doctor was examining the unconscious Nancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick stood stiffly on one side, trembling all over, his hands shaking badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on?" Jasper asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Fowler fainted due to excessive pain. She should wake up in a while." The doctor explained after the examination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Excessive pain?" Jasper was puzzled. "Why did she suddenly experience excessive pain? Did her condition relapse? Or is it because of the baby in her belly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it's me!" Mick said in a trembling voice, lowering his head and looking at his trembling hands. "I shouldn't have lost control and grabbed her shoulder. She... she clearly cried out in pain, but I still didn't let go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was deeply self-blaming. At that moment, he was surrounded by the fear of losing her, desperately wanting her to promise to live well, but forgetting how fragile she was now.</p></div>
