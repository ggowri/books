        <h1>Chapter 268</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All you talk about is your mother! You don't want anything good to happen to your sister. You sure are your mother's good daughter!" Tony Cummins said angrily and stormed straight into the room. Moments later, he came out with a photo album.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shivered. That photo album was... her mother's photo album. It contained many photos of her and her mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She saw Tony Cummins take out a lighter and lit the album on fire. "Since you don't want anything good to happen to your sister, I don't need to give you this photo album. Your mother wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted a daughter like you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The album burst into flames, and Tony Cummins threw it straight onto the tiled floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace almost let out a scream. She pulled her sleeves over her hands to try and swat out the flames as best as she could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It could not burn. It could not!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The photos inside were all memories of her and her mother! The photo album could not be burned like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not even know how long she screamed for. She only kept beating the flames with her hands even though they were burning her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, she was just like a madman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way she looked left Tony Cummins, Melinda Riley, and Evelyn horrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, when the flames were out, Grace looked at the burnt album and realized that her face was full of tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She staggered, held the album in her arms, and looked up coldly at the man she was supposed to call her father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This man could treat the relics of his wife so carelessly&hellip; This was the belonging of a woman whom he had made a lifelong promise to. It became obvious now that her mother was no longer in his heart at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The so-called love would dissipate without even the smallest trace left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s pretty and elegant face was a mess that was soaked with tears, but her almond-shaped eyes were still staring at him coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins was slightly taken aback by her daughter's stare, but he managed to keep his posture by saying, "You... Why are you looking at your father this way? I'll burn the album if I want to. What can you do about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace burst out laughing, but her eyes grew colder. "If Mom was still alive, she would surely wonder why she married a jerk like you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that what you should be saying right now?" Tony Cummins raised his hand in anger and slapped Grace hard in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stumbled backward. She quickly regained her footing while the tattered photo album remained clutched in her arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not worthy to be her husband! If you had any affection for her, you wouldn't have burned this album!" Grace said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She staggered out of the Cummins family's house, clutching her photo album.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three people in the house looked at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you burn it like that? What if she hadn't put out the fire, and it really burned her? Wouldn't it have been fatal?" Melinda Riley said with trepidation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It won't burn that easily." Tony Cummins was still angry and felt that his authority as a father had been disrespected. "If it did, she would have brought it upon herself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Isn't she with Jason now? Do you think she's going to complain to Jason and get even with us?" Melinda Riley said anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't she dare!" Tony Cummins said, glaring. "After all, I'm still her father. Get even? If she dares to get even, I'll make sure she never finds her mother's grave!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nearby, Evelyn lowered her head. Her eyes were gleaming a little. She was just feeling sorry that the fire had not burned Grace!</p></div>
