        <h1>Chapter 3261</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, her face turned red and she quickly pulled Brian back to their seats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the seats, there was still the sour plum juice that Brian had bought earlier, but it had spilled out a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go buy another cup," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, it's just a little spill," she said, and drank it directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sour taste was really good, and it made her feel much better. Valda drank it sip by sip, while Brian looked at her drinking the sour plum juice with tenderness in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it good?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, it's pretty good," she said. Actually, she didn't usually like to drink sour plum juice that much, but for some reason, it tasted really good now. "Maybe it's because I just threw up earlier, so now it feels refreshing to drink."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You threw up earlier?" Brian's brow furrowed, and he asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just suddenly felt a little nauseous and threw up," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian was shocked, and his brow furrowed even more. "What did you eat today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just like usual. I ate too much this morning and threw up once while I was in the studio today," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Brian became anxious. "Why didn't you tell me earlier?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Valda was confused. After all, she didn't think it was a big deal. "Maybe my stomach just wasn't feeling well. I'll rest more and be fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After you finish eating, let's go to the hospital and get you checked," Brian said. He didn't want anything to happen to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was helpless, but she knew he always worried about her, so she agreed with a simple "okay" and buried her head in her porridge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Brian ate, he seemed to be thinking about something. Suddenly, his body stiffened and he looked at Valda with a strange expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, are you..." Brian murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Am I what?" Valda looked up, feeling strange about the way he was looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it possible that you're pregnant?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was shocked. Pregnant? Could it be possible? She had been actively trying to conceive, and her period was indeed delayed, but her period was always irregular, so she didn't think much of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now that he said that, there is indeed a possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then... should I go buy a pregnancy test and check?" Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After we finish eating, let's just go to the hospital for a blood test," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Valda agreed and started eating her porridge quickly. She couldn't wait to go to the hospital and get the results.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Slow down," Brian couldn't help but say. "Be careful not to choke."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally finishing their meal, Valda eagerly pulled Brian to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it was already nighttime, so they could only register at the emergency department.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were few people in the emergency department at this time. After Valda had her blood drawn, she nervously sat in the waiting area, waiting for the results.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It would take half an hour for the blood test results to come out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if... I'm not pregnant?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I haven't conceived, then I'll keep trying," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda bit her lip slightly and suddenly said, "Then... what if... what if I try my best but it doesn't work?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Recently, due to preparing for pregnancy, she has been browsing many forums related to preparing for pregnancy. Some couples have no problems with fertility, but still struggle to conceive. Although the chances of this happening are small, it is still a possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So let's adopt a child," said Brian, as if it was never a difficult decision for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But, don't you think that if you adopt...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda," he interrupted her, "if we don't have our own children, it would certainly be a regret for me, but it wouldn't create any obstacles for us being together. If we have children, that's great. If we don't, it's not a big deal. If we adopt a child, I will treat that child as if they were our own."</p></div>
