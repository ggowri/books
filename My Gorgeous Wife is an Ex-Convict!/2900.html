        <h1>Chapter 2898</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago's face turned pale as she glared at Valda Theller with resentment. "Let's wait and see," she said, before leaving with a look of bitterness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller turned her head and saw two assistants curiously looking in their direction. "Alright, let's get back to work," Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of the assistants asked, "Valda Theller, your great-aunt doesn't seem like the type to give up easily. Shouldn't you prepare for something?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other assistant said, "Don't worry, Valda Theller's boyfriend is Mr. Hart, a wealthy man. Even if her great-aunt doesn't want to give up, what else can she do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller pursed her lips. "That's enough. Don't say anything about Brian Hart being my boyfriend anymore. We've already broken up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Broken up? Valda Theller, is it true?" the two assistants exclaimed in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's true. Now, let's continue with the painting. If we can't finish it today, both of you will have to stay overtime," Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two assistants looked at each other and quickly returned to their workstations to continue painting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller sat back in her chair and although she didn't know what her great-aunt would do next, she had no intention of compromising.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Rowena Santiago left the building, she spat towards it with resentment, planning to find another way to force Valda Theller to agree to her demands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she turned around, a car suddenly pulled up beside her and dragged her into the vehicle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who are you? What do you want?" Rowena Santiago exclaimed in fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But no one in the car paid any attention to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Half an hour later, when Rowena Santiago saw Brian Hart, she trembled with fear and finally knew who had taken her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're here to see Valda Theller," Brian Hart said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I just came to see Valda Theller. I hope she can ask you to spare my husband and son. I...I didn't do anything to Valda Theller, I just...just said a few words," Rowena Santiago said tremblingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart's eyes turned cold. "If you had really done something, do you think you could still stand here and talk to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If Valda Theller doesn't want to see you again, you can't appear in front of her again. The same goes for your husband and son. No matter how many years pass, if you dare to cause her any trouble again, the price you pay will be more than just imprisonment," Brian Hart said in a calm but chilling tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago was filled with fear and regretted ever causing trouble for Valda Theller. She promised to never appear in front of her again, and neither would her husband and son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart glanced at Rowena Santiago coldly before waving his hand. His men took her away, leaving the room in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart leaned heavily against the back of his chair and muttered to himself, "Valda Theller, what should I do? I regret letting you go again..." He regretted letting her go and not giving her more time. He was certain that he would never fall in love with her. But in just a few days, he found himself missing her more and more. She had become so important to him that he would spend entire nights staring at the bed she had once slept in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why won't you give me more time? Why are you so sure that I won't fall in love with you?" he whispered, his voice filled with loneliness.</p></div>
