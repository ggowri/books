        <h1>Chapter 3662</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew very well that the person she loved was William. As for Lawrence, it was guilt towards a friend and regret for what she had done in the past. And Lawrence didn't really want to date her. He probably only had disgust and hatred towards her. Making such a request was just a way to humiliate her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, Lawrence is no longer the person he was back then. He has changed a lot. I don't object to you wanting to be good to him and make up for the suffering he has endured. I just hope you don't get too close to him or trust him too much. Because no one knows what he's planning or what he'll do," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand," Jasper replied. She knew that he said this out of concern for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car stopped at the entrance of the Reed House.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper unbuckled her seatbelt and prepared to get out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what happens in the future, don't forget that I'm by your side," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her head to look at him, leaned over, and kissed him on the cheek. "Thank you. I know you've always been by my side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the more than ten years since they met, whether it was happiness or sadness, he had been with her through it all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without him, she thought her life would be much less colorful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting out of the car, Jasper walked into the house and was about to enter the main room when she saw a figure walking out of the main room towards the Reed family's ancestral hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was...Mason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper followed him and saw that Mason was standing at the entrance of the ancestral hall, but he didn't go in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason," she approached him, "why did you come here so late at night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I couldn't sleep, so I came here to take a look," Mason replied. "What about you? When are you planning to go back to school?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In these two days," Jasper said. After all, she had taken a leave of absence before to avoid those who were trying to ride on William's popularity. Now that the gossip about William had died down, she could go back to school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard Lawrence has been found?" Mason suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Jasper was taken aback for a moment, then replied, "Yes, he has been found."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason looked at his sister's somewhat desolate expression. "Are you unhappy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pursed her lips and hesitated for a moment before saying, "Maybe it's because Lawrence is different from before, and because of some mistakes I made in the past, he doesn't want to forgive me. But I'm already happy that he's still alive."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't see any happiness on your face," Mason said. "It seems that if a person has emotions, they will have more troubles. The fewer emotions, the fewer troubles."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the more emotions, the more happiness," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's eyes flickered slightly, as if he had thought of something. But then, a mocking smile crossed his lips. "What's the use of having more happiness? We still have to live like this. The more troubles we have, the more likely we are to die. Isn't it because our grandfather had too many troubles that he died?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was speechless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, it's better to have fewer unnecessary emotions," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper couldn't help but ask, "Mason, do you think the happiness you had with Veronica was also unnecessary? Didn't you have any nostalgia for it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason said expressionlessly, "If I had nostalgia for it, I wouldn't have hypnotized my memories. For me, there is no nostalgia at all."</span></p></div>
