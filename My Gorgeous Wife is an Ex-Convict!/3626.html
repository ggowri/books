        <h1>Chapter 3624</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't you say you were waiting for my answer? Well, my answer is this," Jasper replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's eyelashes trembled slightly. "Is it because you pity me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him with some confusion, and only heard him say, "If you pity me, and are afraid that I would be even more embarrassed in this turmoil, then you don't have to do this. These things mean nothing to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in his childhood, he faced more embarrassment and humiliation, but he struggled through it, and now he won't be defeated by it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper paused for a moment, "Do you think I pity you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you?" He smiled faintly, masking a hint of bitterness beneath his nonchalant demeanor, "When the time comes to face the media, we can come up with a reason, saying that we never actually..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We don't need to come up with any reason!" She interrupted him, "Isn't it enough that we're together? Haven't you always wanted me to be your girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I do want you to be my girlfriend, but not like this." He reached out, placing his hands on her shoulders, looking at her earnestly, "I don't want any external pressure, I want it to be based on genuine feelings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper blinked, then sighed, raising his hands and encircling William's neck, he took the initiative to tiptoe and their lips met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body stiffened, eyes filled with shock, finding it hard to believe what was happening in this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is she doing... kissing him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace felt like a dream, but the sensation of their lips was so real.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her kiss was awkward in a way, but also incredibly sincere. She even tried to part his lips, deepening the kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled slightly, and the hand that was resting on her shoulder gradually wrapped around her body, pulling her closer into his embrace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And his lips, as she had hoped, parted slightly, allowing her to conquer his territory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only she could make him feel this way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, Jasper finally ended the kiss, breathing heavily. With a blushing face, she looked at William and said, "This is what I truly think."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes flickered with desire, fear, and caution. "Have you really thought it through? Dating me at a time like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If so many things hadn't happened, he would be overjoyed at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was faced with too many uncertainties. If they were to start dating now, she would be dragged into all these complications.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really don't want to date me, do you? Always asking me to consider it!" She glared at him, once again grabbing his collar and pulling him down, so that their eyes met at the same level.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she kissed his lips again, giving him a firm peck. "Is this answer enough? If not, I can give you a few more."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, actually, kissing him felt pretty good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled and suddenly pulled her into his arms, "I don't not want to date you, I actually want to very much. But I'm afraid, afraid that you don't like me as much, and afraid that my current troubles will affect your life!"</span></p></div>
