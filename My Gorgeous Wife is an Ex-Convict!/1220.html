        <h1>Chapter 1219</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not regret her marriage to Jason because it was the best choice at the moment! It was for Lina and the baby's sake!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as she thought of this, a voice from the bottom of her heart suddenly seemed to ask, 'What about me? Is marrying Jason the best choice for me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Are my feelings for Jason really gone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or maybe... they have always been at the bottom of my heart...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not until Grace and Terrence left that Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney came back to their senses. They looked at each other and saw the shock in each other's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that Grace was going to marry Jason? It was because of that Jason was stepping in to help the Sweeney family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was so sudden!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason... He was the richest man in Emerald City. The high and mighty man in Emerald City was going to marry Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, Mr. Sweeney cleared his throat and said, "Don't do that again the next time we see Cummins... Grace. She's been a great help to our family. Lina has a better eye than us. She... has made the right friend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Mr. Sweeney did not know exactly what was going on between Grace and Jason, he had a feeling that Grace's sudden marriage to Jason might have something to do with his daughter's life-threatening injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Guilt flitted across Mrs. Sweeney's face as she said, "Yes, I... I'll apologize the next time she visits Lina. Lina is... probably going to be saved. She'll get better, right..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Sweeney started sobbing as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney patted his wife on the shoulder and said reassuringly, "She'll be alright. Our daughter is not that fragile! Besides, she has to wake up and wait for Hadwin Stephenson to marry her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence drove Grace to Reed Residence, and when the car stopped at the gate, Grace felt as if a lifetime had passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She never thought she would step in here again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed's waiting for you inside," Terrence said respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath and headed inside while Terrence stood outside. He could not help touching his nose as he watched her walk into the main house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he learned that Master Reed was marrying Grace, he was shocked but seemed to have expected it as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Grace seemed to be the only woman Master Reed would possibly marry. He had never seen Master Reed care so much about another woman before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not forget the way Master Reed had trembled as he held Grace and shouted while dialing 120 when she passed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was different from his usual calm and collected manner!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Getting married to the Reed family and becoming the mistress of the Reed family would also mean that Grace would become the most honorable woman in Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went into the main house and saw Jason sitting on the couch in the living room. He had a book on his lap. He was probably reading but looked up toward her when he heard her come in.</p></div>
