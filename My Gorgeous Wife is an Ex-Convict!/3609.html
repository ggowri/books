        <h1>Chapter 3607</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper and Meave walked into the dormitory together, while William stood outside. He didn't </span><span>leave until he lost sight of Jasper's figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meave was curious and asked, "How are things between you and William?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper replied, "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean what was mentioned in that post today. Did you two...uhm, have an argument?" Meave asked. "Many people in our class are saying that you must have had a fight with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I argue with William? People in our class are so boring! We are on good terms!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meave asked again, "So, everything in that post isn't true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pursed her lips and after a moment said, "I know William better than anyone. The person who made that post definitely has ill intentions. William will definitely find out who it is!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was very confident about this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't believe that someone who made a post couldn't be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, only by finding that person could they truly know what their motive was for making such a post!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jasper returned to the dorm, as expected, his dormmates Horea and Nina were also concerned about the matter and asked Jasper how things went with William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Jasper gave the same answer again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I told you, Mr. Barlow doesn't seem like someone with ulterior motives!" Nina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, all that talk about revenge and retaliation, it's like the person who posted it was writing a novel!" Horea chimed in, "Maybe the person who posted it is just twisted in the head!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But is William's mother really a criminal?" Meave asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Horea and Nina looked at Jasper with curiosity, clearly wanting to know the truth as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper spoke seriously, "No one can choose their birth, and if you still consider me a friend in the future, I hope you won't ask about this matter again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them exchanged glances, and after a moment, Meave said, "You're right, no one can choose their birth. My bad for asking!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, yeah, let's not ask anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, can someone lend me their notes from today's class? I didn't take any during the lecture!" Nina changed the topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I owe you," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The four-person dormitory returned to its usual cheerful atmosphere, as if the little incident from earlier had never happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...The next day, when Jasper arrived in the classroom, all of her classmates stared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In many people's eyes, there was sympathy, pity, mockery, or schadenfreude!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few girlfriends even ran up to Jasper, looking concerned, and said, "Jasper, don't be sad, no one could have expected something like this! But fortunately, William's conspiracy has been exposed, and we will be there for you in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right, there are plenty of good guys out there in this world, you will definitely find someone better!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Exactly, why hang on to one tree? We will accompany you in looking for someone else in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several girls kept saying, as if they wished they could become Jasper's confidantes through this incident!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did I ever say I was sad?" Jasper asked with a smile, "Also, William's conspiracy? Do you all have such vivid imaginations? Or do you just enjoy hearing things that aren't true? We're all college students, we shouldn't lack basic discernment, right? Just because you read a post, you think it's a fact?"</span></p></div>
