        <h1>Chapter 4229 What if I don't love you?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I want to go out for a walk with Chandler," Tina said to her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what about your health..." Lina expressed her concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My health has almost recovered, and the doctor also said that I need to be more active," Tina replied. She then took the initiative to walk up and hold Chandler's arm. "And with Chandler by my side, if anything unexpected happens, he will protect me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying these words, she looked up at him. "Right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's face showed surprise, followed by a sense of joy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I will protect you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina and Hadwin exchanged a glance, and finally, Hadwin spoke. "Well then, you two can go out for a walk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina and Chandler left the Stephenson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina looked at her husband and said, "Tina actually took the initiative to hold Chandler's arm. Could it be that Tina remembered something?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she really remembered something, she would tell us," Hadwin said. "I think it's because these days, she has been looking at a lot of photos and videos of her and Chandler from before. Maybe she had some thoughts."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Will Tina accept Chandler?" Lina couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really didn't want to see two children who once loved each other end up as strangers, especially considering Chandler's feelings for Tina, which she had always known about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the two children really separated, then one day, if Tina regained her memory, it would be endless regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She will, after all, Tina used to love Chandler very much, didn't she?" Hadwin understood his wife's worries and said, "Moreover, Chandler won't easily leave Tina."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Chandler loves Tina, even more, a love that even Hadwin finds incredible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina held Chandler's arm and walked to a park outside the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The park was very clean, but there weren't many people inside because this area was the wealthy district of Emerald City, and most of the people living here didn't have the habit of visiting parks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for Tina, this was just right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that we used to love each other very much," Tina initiated the conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Chandler replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These past few days, I have looked at many of our old photos and videos, but I can't remember anything about the past. It's like watching someone else's story," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's eyes revealed a hint of disappointment, then he said, "It's okay, I can patiently wait for you to regain your memory."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I never regain my memory in my entire life?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's okay too. You are still Tina, and that has never changed." Regardless of whether she has her memory or not, she will always be the Tina he loves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But a Tina without past memories doesn't love you. Is that okay?" she asked, looking at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes flickered slightly. "The longer you live, the more you realize that in this world, everything involves both gaining and losing. Although you have lost your memory, you are still alive, and our child is also alive. That's already lucky amidst the misfortune. For me, it's God's blessing. So even if you don't love me, it's okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice seemed calm, but it carried an indescribable heaviness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew very well that if she didn't love him if there wouldn't be a second child between them, what kind of fate would await him.</span></p></div>
