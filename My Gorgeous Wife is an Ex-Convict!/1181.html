        <h1>Chapter 1180</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, after the Frozen Heart ring was finished, Master Reed locked it in a safe and never took it out again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like a taboo, just like how Grace's name had become Master Reed's taboo too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this woman was violating the taboo again and again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go and find out how she knows about Frozen Heart. Whoever leaked it will take responsibility for it," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman who was begging Grace turned pale, and her lips trembled as she tried to speak, but she did not know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, she's right. There&rsquo;s no use asking her," Jason said to the waitress, but his eyes were looking at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For an instant, Grace felt as though a huge storm was surging in her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was looking at her. However... there seemed to be no place for her in his eyes. There was no emotion in those beautiful peach-blossom eyes, only dead silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rather, she was nothing to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Terrence, I don't want to see this woman in Emerald City anymore," Jason said lightly and got into the car that was waiting nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence glanced at the waitress and Grace. He naturally understood that Master Reed was referring to the waitress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Master Reed did not want Grace to stay in Emerald City, how could Grace still be in front of Master Reed like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason and his men left, Lina rushed forward and tore the waitress' hand away from her best friend's arm. "It's alright that you pissed Jason off, but why drag Grace into this? You deserved what you got when a woman like you tried to get to the top by using someone else! I won't let you off the hook easily if you ever harass Grace again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said and dragged Grace toward Hadwin Stephenson's car. Hadwin Stephenson followed the two women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when they almost got to the car, Lina suddenly said, "Grace, why is your hand&hellip; trembling?" Yes, it was faintly trembling and was a little cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." Grace was about to speak when nausea suddenly rose from her stomach. She pushed her best friend away, squatted down on the roadside, and threw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She vomited badly. She threw up everything she had eaten before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, are you okay?" Lina hurried forward and asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no time to answer her best friend. She continued to vomit until she felt her stomach was empty and there was nothing more to vomit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina quickly took out a tissue and handed it to her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wiped her lips and gasped before saying, "Maybe it was that woman's hand... I... feel a little sick..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina did not ask any more questions, knowing that Grace may have been reminded of when she had her fingernails pulled out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although that woman deserved it for what she did, it still reminded her best friend of that painful time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then get some rest after you get back. Don't overthink it," said Lina.</p></div>
