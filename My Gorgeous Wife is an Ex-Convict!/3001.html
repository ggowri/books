        <h1>Chapter 2999</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fynn, speak up," Linda urged her boyfriend. As she turned her head, she saw her boyfriend looking surprised and his face turning slightly pale. "What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Linda raised her hand to touch Fynn, but he pushed her away and quickly walked over to Brian. He bowed and apologized, "Mr. Hart, I'm really sorry about earlier. My girlfriend has a habit of speaking her mind. Please don't take offense."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think it's more than just being outspoken," Brian said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes. She shouldn't have said those things to you and your girlfriend. I will make sure she apologizes properly," Fynn said, then turned to Linda and scolded her, "You need to apologize to Mr. Hart and Miss Theller right away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Apologize?!" Linda's face was full of disbelief. "You want me to apologize to them?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else?" Fynn said irritably, hating his girlfriend at that moment. He knew very well that his girlfriend was often difficult to deal with and liked to show off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But if you're going to show off, at least you should figure out the other person's background!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This is like kicking a big iron plate directly. Shouldn't you apologize?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why should I apologize!" Linda said irritably, especially since there were still many students looking over in their direction. If she apologized, she would lose face big time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just because it's Brian!" Fynn shouted in his mind, his expression becoming even more unpleasant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shouldn't you apologize for slandering others like you just did?" He approached Linda and whispered a few words that only they could hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Linda heard this, she was completely shocked. She looked at Brian and then at Valda, especially at Valda's gaze, which seemed to be piercing through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Next, Linda's face turned red and white as she walked up to Valda. She spoke slowly and carefully, as if each word was difficult to say: "Valda, I'm really sorry about what I said earlier. I shouldn't have said those things. Please don't be upset with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying this, Linda didn't care about anything else and walked out of the room quickly. Taylah saw this and quickly followed her out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And Fynn was speaking cautiously to Brian, saying, "Mr. Hart, please don't take offense at what happened today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the prince takes offense, his directing career could be ruined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My girlfriend doesn't mind, so naturally I won't mind," Brian said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fynn looked pitifully at Valda again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at him and said, "I just hope that you and your girlfriend won't look down on others easily in the future. Even if the comic book you like is not like my small comics, if you can't even respect others, how can you become a good director in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I've learned my lesson!" Fynn said repeatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Linda and Taylah had already left the building. Taylah asked in confusion, "Linda, why did you apologize to that Valda person? It doesn't make sense. And what's wrong with Fynn? He usually spoils you, but why did he act like that when he saw Valda's boyfriend? You need to talk to Fynn about this..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every word Taylah said at this moment seemed to embarrass Linda even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Angrily, Linda said, "Are you done? If you don't speak, no one will think you're mute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, Linda, I'm just thinking about you!" Taylah said unhappily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't understand anything!" Linda retorted, "Do you know who Valda's boyfriend is? He's the prince of the entertainment industry, Brian! Do you think I should apologize? Do you even know why I apologized?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taylah was stunned, her jaw dropped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No way, that person is Brian?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's boyfriend is Brian?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taylah felt like she was hearing a fairy tale, but Linda's expression made her realize that it was true!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda, whom they looked down upon, actually found a prince charming in the entertainment industry as her boyfriend! This is too... unbelievable!</p></div>
