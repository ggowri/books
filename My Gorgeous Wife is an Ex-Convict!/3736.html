        <h1>Chapter 3734</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica trembled and turned to Mason, who had walked up to her. Why was he here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason walked up to Veronica and directly grabbed the hand that Daniel was holding onto her wrist. He almost effortlessly pulled Daniel's hand away. "Mr. Cross, I hope you won't bother my girlfriend again in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Girlfriend?" Daniel was surprised and looked at Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Veronica herself was stunned. Weren't she and Mason just trying to date? They weren't officially dating, let alone being boyfriend and girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, why do you think I'm here with her?" Mason stared at Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Girlfriend?" Daniel suddenly laughed and looked at Veronica again. "It seems that I'm unnecessary. Actually, from the beginning, I was unnecessary. But since I'm unnecessary, why did I meet you guys in the first place?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't met these two people, then the Cross family...wouldn't have fallen into their current situation. And he could have had a better life instead of constantly hitting walls in job hunting and having to work as a delivery driver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt that Daniel's gaze was like a thorn, making her extremely uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Impatiently, Mason said, "What, are you planning to stand here and talk nonsense? I don't have time to continue this nonsense with you!" Then he looked down at Veronica and said, "Didn't you say you wanted to go to the bathroom? Are you not going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Veronica hesitated. Given the current situation, how could she go?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think I'll do? This is a mall," Mason said, his tone even colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica naturally heard the displeasure in his voice. After thinking for a moment, she followed Mason's lead and said, "Then...I'll go first." Then she looked at Daniel again and said, "Mr. Cross, let's just let the past be the past."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Let the past be the past? If past events could really just be left behind like that, then what was the point of his current life?! Daniel thought to himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Veronica went to the bathroom, Daniel looked at Mason and said, "As expected of the Reed family's young master, you can get whatever you want with money. Money is really great."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason only glanced at Daniel indifferently and said, "I don't want to hear you talk nonsense anymore, and I don't want to see you around Veronica again. It's best if you stay away from her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was furious. "Do you think that just because you have money, you can do whatever you want?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason didn't say anything, but his beautiful black eyes were filled with a hint of killing intent, making Daniel shiver with cold. This man, this kind of gaze, was like he wanted to kill someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, in this world, money can't buy everything!" Daniel said before turning and leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason stood still, his face dark.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he knew that if money could buy everything in this world, he wouldn't have had to resort to hypnosis in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Veronica came out of the bathroom, she found Mason standing at the door, obviously waiting for her.</span></p></div>
