        <h1>Chapter 2072</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After some training, even the teacher who taught him could not help but praise that such tenacity was seldom found in ordinary children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss was standing not far away as he watched his son train. Even though his son was repeatedly knocked onto the ground, he would soon get back up and persisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes that were similar to Kyla's showed rare adamancy and determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss knew that his son wanted to become stronger. His desire was so strong that it was as if the child had already suffered all sorts of ups and downs at such a young age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss felt miserable. If he had not been blinded by hatred and believed Paisley Daniels in the past, he would have a happy family now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Nelson Corbyn finished his practice, Martin Weiss came forward and said, "I'll take you home later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn refused and said, "No thanks. I saw a bus nearby when I came here. I can take the bus home! I can come here and go back by myself in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you have to repel me so much? I'm your father!" said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But I was born without a father!" said Nelson Corbyn as he walked straight into the nearby changing room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The short sentence was like rubbing a handful of salt into Martin Weiss's wound, making his pain worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Nelson Corbyn boarded the bus himself, Martin Weiss had his men follow his son and escort him home safely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mr. Weiss, Little Young Master Nelson has reached home safely." His men called Martin Weiss and told him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Follow him and protect him every time he goes to and return from class," said Martin Weiss. Then, he put away his phone and looked at the computer screen in front of him. Chase Harper's information was on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was not only information about Chase Harper and his daughter Juliet Harper but also everything about Chase Harper's ex-wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss looked at the information with dark eyes and a cold face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Over the weekend, Chase Harper took Juliet Harper to Kyla's store. Juliet Harper clung to Nelson, insisting that Nelson played with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Kyla asked Nelson to take Juliet to the small park nearby to play, while Mrs. Corbyn went with the two children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper did not follow but stayed in the store to help Kyla repair one of the store shelves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was going to find a repairman to repair it, but Chase Harper said he could repair it. He even brought tools with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two carried the shelves that needed to be repaired outside. Chase Harper began to repair them with his tools, while Kyla helped him by occasionally passing him tools and water.</p></div>
