        <h1>Chapter 4400: He Can Rely On Her</h1>
        <div><p>Harley quickly walked over to the bed, intending to untie the ropes binding Calvert.</p><p>But the moment her hand touched Calvert, he desperately dodged away, continuously shouting, &quot;No... I don&#x27;t want... Don&#x27;t touch me, don&#x27;t touch me!&quot;</p><p>That handsome face was contorted, as he desperately tried to suppress the effects of the drug coursing through his body.</p><p>Beads of sweat, the size of soybeans, kept rolling down his forehead. His face and exposed skin were a shade of pink.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s me!&quot; Harley said, feeling even more heartbroken for Calvert.</p><p>But it seemed as if Calvert didn&#x27;t hear a thing, he kept resisting Harley&#x27;s touch.</p><p>It&#x27;s like a desperate little creature, frantically trying to protect itself, yet powerless to do so!</p><p>Seeing Calvert like this, Harley&#x27;s heart was filled with pain.</p><p>She suddenly pulled Calvert into her arms, ignoring his struggles, and kept saying, &quot;It&#x27;s me, Calvert, it&#x27;s me! Don&#x27;t be scared, I&#x27;m here now, you&#x27;ll be okay!&quot;</p><p>Calvert, who had been struggling, gradually stopped. His black eyes, already confused and unable to even focus properly, were now trying hard to look in her direction.</p><p>&quot;Har... Harley...&quot; A hoarse voice, struggling to form the words.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s me!&quot; Harley said, &quot;Everything&#x27;s fine, there&#x27;s nothing to worry about!&quot;</p><p>Then Harley turned to his bodyguard and said, &quot;Take this woman and that agent to the police station. And as for the manager, not a word about today&#x27;s incident should be leaked.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, yes!&quot; the manager quickly agreed.</p><p>In a matter of moments, only Calvert and Harley were left in the room!</p><p>Harley carefully untied the ropes binding Calvert&#x27;s hands, looking at his flushed face.</p><p>&quot;How are you doing? Do you know what that woman fed you?&quot; Harley asked, regretting that she hadn&#x27;t asked more clearly earlier.</p><p>He should have clarified what that woman fed him before sending her off to the police station.</p><p>In just a moment, on the way to the hospital, I&#x27;ll call the bodyguard to clarify about the medicine!</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;ll take you now...&quot; Harley said, trying to help Calvert up and take him to the hospital.</p><p>But when her hand touched him again, he desperately pushed her away.</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t... don&#x27;t come near me, I&#x27;m...&quot; He struggled to say, briefly lucid because of her voice. But now, the effects of the drug were overpowering his rationality again.</p><p>It felt like he could lose his sanity at any moment, driven by his desires.</p><p>Especially at this moment, the person in front of him is the one he&#x27;s been daydreaming about, the one he&#x27;s been longing for!</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t... don&#x27;t look at me, I... I didn&#x27;t mean to...&quot; He desperately tugged at the tattered cloth on his body, trying to cover himself.</p><p>However, due to the medication, the body is having a natural physiological reaction.</p><p>He was terrified, afraid that she would see his ugly physiological reaction and think it was a desecration!</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t worry.&quot; Harley quickly grabbed Calvert, covering him with a blanket, &quot;It&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;ll take you to the hospital. I won&#x27;t let anything happen to you. You don&#x27;t need to worry about anything, just trust me!&quot;</p><p>Calvert was groggily helped up by Harley. Does he just need to lean on her?</p><p>All along, he could only rely on himself. His mother abandoned him, his father was always ready to hit and scold him. He had no one to lean on.</p><p>Even though his body was burning up, as if he could lose control at any moment, his anxious heart was gradually calming down!</p></div>
