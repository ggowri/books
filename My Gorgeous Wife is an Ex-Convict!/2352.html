        <h1>Chapter 2350</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seven months ago, doctors only stated that there would be no serious problem if things went well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, things were not going well now. It had only been five months, yet she was already in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How many more painful episodes... would follow? Each time was a danger to the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face darkened when he heard what the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the doctor and nurse left the ward, Martin Weiss looked at Kyla, who lay on the hospital bed looking fragile. "Are you going to insist on having this baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," muttered Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you have to give birth to the baby? Haven't you always hated me and never had feelings for me? Why give birth to a child of my blood?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was silent for a moment before muttering, "I gave birth... to Nelson too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression changed before he laughed at himself. "Yeah, you gave birth to Nelson too. No matter how much you hate me, you still can't bring yourself to give up human life, can you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. She chose to give birth to the baby not just because it was a human life but also because of her feelings for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The feelings she had buried deep down within her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not have feelings for her anymore, so some things were better left unsaid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe it was okay to let him think that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss gazed at Kyla for a while before saying, "Rest first. I'll take care of the hospitalization procedures for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After he left the ward, the silence made Kyla smile bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"...Perhaps it's best to let you continue to forget about it. That way, if anything happens to me, you&rsquo;ll still be alive and well..." she murmured as her hands rested on her bulging belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The fate of her and the unborn child remained unknown. Good things or bad things might happen in the blink of an eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, at least Martin Weiss, who had forgotten his feelings for her, would not risk his own life for her and their children anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the choice she made, so she did not regret it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Kyla's phone on the bedside table rang. She looked at the phone to see that it was a phone call from Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she answered the phone, Chase Harper said anxiously, "Kyla, is this Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's me, Chase," answered Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How are you? Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "I'm fine. I'm much better now, but I have to stay in the hospital for a few days for further observation. I'm sorry that you were misunderstood and even got involved in this matter today, Chase."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you talking about? I should be the one to apologize for causing a misunderstanding between you two. Why don't I&hellip; explain it to Mr. Weiss?" said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I'll explain it to him." Kyla was worried that things would get worse if Chase Harper did it. "Chase, you didn't miss the train ride, did you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper said, "I didn't manage to get on the train. But since you're alright, I'll just get a ticket for the next train."</p></div>
