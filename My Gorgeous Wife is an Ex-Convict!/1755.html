        <h1>Chapter 1753</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Jason said Lily's name, Secretary Wang stiffened slightly. Although it was only for a brief moment, Jason already saw through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Lily... Lily knows Mason is my and Grace's son. Did Lily do this?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The police and the Reed family had not found Lily even after so many years. Secretary Wang must have played a major role in this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Otherwise, how could Lily have remained hidden for so many years after losing her wealth and status?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason let go of the man, got up, and looked coldly at Secretary Wang, who was lying awkwardly on the ground. "If anything happens to my son, I&rsquo;ll send you to meet the old master!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His voice was so cold that it made Secretary Wang shiver. Young Master seemed to have gone back to being the young master from before, who had not known Grace yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Cruel, decisive, and ruthless&mdash;this was what Old master Reed thought the heir of the Reed family should look like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Young Master was only showing such a ruthless side because of his child. Was it a good thing? Grace was already Young Master's weakness, and now, were their children going to be his weakness too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Young Master could show his cruelest side for these weaknesses, but these weaknesses could easily destroy Young Master too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason left, and the prison guard took Secretary Wang back to the prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Old Master, it seems that things have gotten a little tricky. Young Master seems to have more weaknesses now. Maybe it would have been better not to save Grace and these three children. If you were still alive, would you blame me for this?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang muttered to himself, but no one could answer him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason returned to Reed Residence, and Grace was still awake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Did Secretary Wang say who else knows about Mason's identity?" Grace asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He didn't say, but it's probably Lily," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lily?" Grace was stunned. The name seemed to tear a hole in her memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Speaking of which, all this had happened because of Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily was involved in her imprisonment, her falling into the sea, and her five-year separation from Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"On my way back, I had someone look up everything related to Lily, including the Atkinson family and the Stevens family!" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help trembling. "What... What will Lily do to Mason? What if she wants more than money..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If it were anyone else, Grace would think that the kidnapper just wanted money and would not hurt the child!</p></div>
