        <h1>Chapter 2499</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She risked her life to save those three kids back then. What would she risk for the baby in her belly now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss came to Kyla's ward again at night. He could not explain why he could only calm down and fall asleep after seeing her sleeping face in the dead of night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what surprised him this time was that she was not asleep when he walked into the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned around, wanting to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't go!" shouted Kyla. She would have run out of bed to grab him had her belly not made it difficult to get on and out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss paused and stayed in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you here to see me?" Kyla asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what if I am?" he asked, his eyes falling on her sallow face. Her complexion was getting worse these days, and he knew it was a sign that her liver was failing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was already in bad shape. Even if they took out the baby, her current liver would not last much longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm happy if you are. And if you're not, I feel lucky to have seen you," replied Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes narrowed. "Are women so fickle? When I appeared in front of you, you told me not to appear in front of you again and bother your peaceful life. Now, you feel happy and lucky? Kyla, don't you think it's too ironic of you to say that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's fine that you think I'm fickle." She smiled. Even though the doctor had not said anything to her, she could still feel the changes in her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her liver must be failing her, and her body was getting more and more overwhelmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you come closer so that I can take a better look at you?" she asked. She might not be able to see him like this in years to come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not even know whether she would be able to complete their so-called contract. If something happened to her and she died before completing the contract, their marriage would be void.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would be a free man again when that happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that necessary? Do you think you haven't seen enough of me?" Martin Weiss asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla replied, "It's necessary. I want to take a good look at you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips were pressed together tightly as he walked over to her bedside and sat down on a chair nearby. "Alright, you can look."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She studied his face carefully. She looked at his eyes, nose, lips... "Tell me. What do you think our second child will look like? The doctor hinted that the baby is going to be a girl. I think she&rsquo;ll be adorable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, she said, "Martin Weiss, let's take a family photo together after I&rsquo;m discharged, okay? That way, we'll at least have been a family once even if we do part in the end."</p></div>
