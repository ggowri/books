        <h1>Chapter 2840</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, just do it like usual. I'll take care of everything." He comforted her softly in a voice that only they could hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of everything...' That sentence instantly calmed the tension in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took a deep breath, laid the drawing paper flat on the table in front of her, and began to draw with a pen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She forgot where she was and was solely focused on Brian. She looked at him while she drew him with her pen. Her concentration also gradually made everyone silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone looked at Valda Theller and Brian in the light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two looked like a &lsquo;good match&rsquo; to many people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After some time, Valda Theller finally finished the last stroke. She let out a long breath and said, "All done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The staff member then walked forward. They put away the portrait and pen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The emcee on stage said, "Alright, let's thank Mr. Hart and his girlfriend. I hope this portrait will be bid with a good price later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lights went back on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expression of Phoebe Cross, who originally wanted to watch the show unfold, contorted from resentment. She intended to humiliate Valda Theller but seemed to have helped her instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Was the spotlight earlier a coincidence?" A voice suddenly rang out beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross turned around to see that Patrick had walked up to her at some point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know what you mean by that," Phoebe Cross said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't know? I can tell it's no accident. Do you think Brian can't tell that?" Patrick said with a chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What the hell are you talking about?" Phoebe Cross asked with a guilty look in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick said knowingly, "You might want to stop playing tricks like that. Brian hasn't gone after you because we grew up together. Otherwise, you can only cry when he does go after you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you on Valda Theller's side now? What did the woman offer you?" Phoebe Cross snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She didn't give me anything. I only want Brian to be happy," muttered Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you so sure I'm not the right one for him?" Phoebe Cross asked, unconvinced. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick sighed and looked at her with a sympathetic gaze. "You have too many dirty tricks up your sleeve. Brian has been through a lot. Maybe all he needs is a simple woman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, he said, "I'm warning you for your own good. Don't come to me if you don't listen and get into trouble!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That&rsquo;ll never happen," Phoebe Cross said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla returned to Martin Weiss's side, she lamented, "I didn't expect Brian to be so protective of Valda. It seems their relationship is going strong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think their relationship is strong?" Martin Weiss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Isn't it?" Kyla asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss muttered, "Maybe. Maybe some feelings can be replaced, while some can't. I envy him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla felt a slight pang in her heart. Then, she comforted herself, 'Don't let it bother me. Didn't I say I'll move on?'</p></div>
