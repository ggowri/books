        <h1>Chapter 1409</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was shown on the screen of a high-rise building. 'Doesn't that mean... everyone can see it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels was trembling as she held the phone, and her face had also turned from pale to red!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On the screen, she only saw many pedestrians stopping to look up at the electronic screen. A few had even taken out their phones to start filming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Who is it? Who's trying to harm me? How do I explain this to Martin?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels was panicking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mr. Daniels and Mrs. Daniels noticed their daughter's strange behavior. Mrs. Daniels walked up and said, "What's the matter? What are you looking at?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as her sight fell on her daughter's phone, Mrs. Daniels's face immediately changed too. "What... What's this? Who did this? Hurry... Hurry and get someone to destroy these and take down the news and videos. We can't let Martin see them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mr. Daniels also hurried forward and grabbed the phone. After watching it for a while, his face turned extremely grim. He angrily scolded his daughter, "It's alright that you got pregnant, but how could you let someone take this video?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels said in a panic, "I... I didn't know! I don't know where the video came from! Dad, what do we do? Martin will find out about the news... and the video too. What... What do we do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What she cared about the most was that she might not be able to marry Martin Weiss and become the mistress of the Weiss family as she wished!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had worked so hard to get to where she was now. There was no way she could fail because of this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It must be... Grace who&rsquo;s framing me. Isn't she Kyla Corbyn's friend? It must be her. It's her!" Paisley Daniels's eyes glowed with resentment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why is Grace so nosy? Why does she want to frame me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace?" Mr. Daniels was shocked. He thought of the day Grace broke into the ward. The one beside Grace was Emerald City's local tyrant&mdash;Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Reed family of Emerald City&hellip; They were a giant far more fearsome than the Weiss family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If they offended the Weiss family, the Daniels family might still have a chance to escape. However, if they offended the Reed family, they might not even have a chance to continue living.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We have no idea if Grace did this, but at least for now... we have to pacify Martin Weiss first," Mr. Daniels said to his daughter. As long as they could pacify Martin Weiss, then they might still have a chance to turn things around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the hotel suite, Martin Weiss was also watching the same video that Paisley Daniels had just watched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The couple in the video were doing something that only the most intimate people could do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The woman was even his fianc&eacute;e, the woman he was supposed to marry soon. He was supposed to be outraged to see such a video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he strangely did not feel anything. It was as if he was looking at a joke, a farce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He only found himself being ridiculous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he read the comments under the news, many netizens commented saying he was some cuckold king, for he was so gullible to want to marry Paisley Daniels. They also wondered whether the child Paisley Daniels miscarried this time was even his.</p></div>
