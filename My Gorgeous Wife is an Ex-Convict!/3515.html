        <h1>Chapter 3513</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She walked out of the room and approached the front door of the house. Upon opening it, she was met with Jasper's anxious face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Standing beside Jasper was William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Jasper saw Veronica, he urgently said to her, "Veronica, Mason is about to board a plane. Come with me to the airport and stop him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Veronica was surprised. "He's going to the airport?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, Mason is going abroad. I don't know what he's going to do there, but our parents have agreed to it. Veronica, what happened between you and Mason yesterday? Why would he suddenly want to go abroad?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was stunned, as if she couldn't snap out of Jasper's news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica!" Jasper's voice grew louder. She checked the time and said, "I don't care what happened between you and Mason, but go to the airport and stop him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her opinion, only Veronica could stop Mason from leaving the country.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only Jasper's hand managed to grab Veronica, but she managed to break free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"His going abroad is his own business, I... I won't go..." Veronica said, her head feeling even more dizzy and with a hint of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what if Mason goes abroad and doesn't plan on coming back in the short term? I heard my parents say that Mason seems to be planning on going abroad for a while," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, he's going abroad to avoid being caught as one of the planners of the kidnapping case, and to avoid getting into trouble? That's why he's going abroad first? Veronica thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, are you really not going to stop my Mason?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not going." Veronica replied. "Jasper, Mason went abroad just to avoid a lawsuit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Avoid a lawsuit?" Jasper asked in confusion. "What lawsuit does he need to avoid?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica pursed her lips tightly and remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, if you know something, just say it!" Jasper pressed on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Veronica Grace didn't speak, perhaps because she didn't know how to say it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you really don't want to say it, then I'll help Jasper find out. It's just a matter of a few days earlier or later," William said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's body stiffened. She knew very well that the Barlow family behind William could easily find out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The kidnapping case was initially planned by him and Lionel. They wanted to stage a fake kidnapping to make up with me," Veronica said with great difficulty. When these words came out of her mouth, her throat felt even more scorching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper widened his eyes and asked, "How is that possible? Did Mason say that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it was Lionel who said it. And Mason was there at the time," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did he explicitly say that he did it?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica fell silent. What did he say at that time? For a moment, she couldn't remember and felt dizzy.</p></div>
