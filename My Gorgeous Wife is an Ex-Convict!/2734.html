        <h1>Chapter 2732</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must be hungry. Try and see if you like these. I'll get something else if you don't." Brian's voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"These will do," Valda Theller said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian helped her cut a large steak into pieces before moving the plate in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah, thank you," she said subconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you thanking me? It's what I'm supposed to do since I'm your boyfriend," he said, lifting his fingers and gently tucking the locks of hair over her cheek behind her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face reddened slightly. She knew everything was false, but her heart was still beating fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was already 70 to 80 percent full after eating the food. While she was eating, Brian was like the perfect boyfriend. He carefully told her how to eat something she had never eaten before and even bent over to fix her skirt when she got up after she finished eating...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything was like Cinderella's dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing the meal, Brian said to Grace and Jason, "Excuse me, I have to bring Valda to meet some friends."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, we'll talk next time," Grace said with a laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Brian walked away with Valda Theller, Jason looked at the smile on Grace's lips and said, "Are you in a good mood?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Yeah. Brian has found someone he loves now. I'm happy for him, and I have a feeling that Valda is also a good woman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man&rsquo;s beautiful peach blossom eyes glimmered slightly as Jason smiled. "Yeah, it's indeed something worth feeling happy for."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was fine as long as she was happy. It did not matter if it was true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since it was Brian's choice, he would let Brian go on with this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go home earlier. You're pregnant and need an early rest," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, but... Honey, I'd like to have another slice of the cake earlier. It's delicious," said Grace. Speaking of which, she had been having a sweet tooth for the past two months. Perhaps the little one she was carrying was a girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having two sons and two daughters would be like having the best of both worlds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I'll get it for you," said Jason, his eyes full of love for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted nothing but the best for the woman he could love with everything he had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller accompanied Brian to meet some people, and Brian also drank a lot of wine with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller thought Brian had no choice but drink because he needed to socialize at first, but she later found that he seemed to be drinking on purpose. It was as if... he wanted to get drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, you've had a lot to drink," Valda Theller could not help but remind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her and chuckled. "I can hold my liquor. This is nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at him. He was smiling, but his eyes looked as if they were about to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because of... Grace?' When she was eating just now, she could see that Grace was happy and Jason took great care of her.</p></div>
