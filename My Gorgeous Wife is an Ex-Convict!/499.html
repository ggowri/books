        <h1>Chapter 498</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;About that... I can&rsquo;t be going around announcing that I have a boyfriend.&rdquo; If she did that, her colleagues would think that she was a lunatic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Is that so? Okay, I understand,&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked her eyes. &lsquo;What does he understand? Why do I have a feeling that we&rsquo;re not on the same page?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day at the company Lina worked in, rumors about yesterday&rsquo;s incident were spreading like wildfire. The kind of gazes that her colleagues gave her was different than the usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of them even mocked Lina right in her face. &ldquo;How shameless of you! Hattie Robson and Taylor Carline are a couple yet you still want to put your foot in!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Even if you want to be a third party, don&rsquo;t do it within the company!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina scoffed and fought back. &ldquo;What third party? If you all don&rsquo;t know the whole truth, then check the facts first. If I would have eyes for Taylor Carline, I&rsquo;d dig out my eyes!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just being boastful now. What&rsquo;s wrong with Taylor Carline? He&rsquo;s a graduate from one of the national key universities. It won&rsquo;t be too long before he&rsquo;s invited to join the main company. By then, he would have a bright future ahead of him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The company they worked in was a branch company. The staff benefits within the main company were better, thus everyone aimed to get into the main company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Hattie Robson and Taylor Carline came over. When Hattie Robson saw Lina, she began mocking her. &ldquo;Lina, I think you can start packing up your belongings and look for a new job. Oh dear, but this year&rsquo;s economy is not too good. Should I get my father to contact other design institutes to see if anyone will hire you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina frowned. She heard that Hattie Robson&rsquo;s father was a professor in one of the design faculty, thus he knew quite a few design institutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Hattie Robson said that, Lina understood that Hattie Robson intended to cut off Lina&rsquo;s progression in this field.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How despicable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina rolled her eyes and was not afraid of those threats. She was not going to starve even if she did not work in this line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Some people think that they rule the world!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need that. If you have so much free time, you should spend more time watching over your boyfriend. However, I think both of you are a match made for each other. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m not the least bit interested. My boyfriend is way better than this Taylor Carline here!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hattie Robson felt that Lina was merely making a pointless struggle. &ldquo;Boyfriend? What boyfriend do you have! If you had a boyfriend, you wouldn&rsquo;t be seducing Ziyu! Am I right, Ziyu?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taylor Carline immediately nodded cowardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was annoyed by Taylor Carline&rsquo;s attitude. He was so despicable when he tried to harass her back then yet was acting like a coward now. What a sissy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Lina felt that Hadwin&rsquo;s image in her heart became so much greater. He was too awesome a comparison against this Taylor Carline!</p></div>
