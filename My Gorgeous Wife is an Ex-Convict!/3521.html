        <h1>Chapter 3519</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying these words, the phone call ended. Veronica stared at her phone in confusion. Did he not want her to be Veronica anymore?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was the child who always chased after her and liked to snuggle up to her really going to separate from her completely?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears fell even harder! She instinctively wanted to call back, but no one answered on the other end of the phone, no matter how many times she tried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, Veronica." Jason next to her held her hand. He had naturally heard the conversation between the two children just now. "You and Mason should take this time to calm down and think about your feelings towards each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was taken aback, "Emotions?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, if you really only see Mason as a 'little brother', then distancing yourselves from each other during this incident might not be a bad thing," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a father, he naturally understood his son's emotions. All along, he and his wife were most worried that Mason's feelings for Veronica were too absolute. However, Veronica might not have any feelings for Mason beyond siblinghood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that were the case, it would only result in hurt for both children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, as they had feared, it had happened. However, the outbreak had occurred earlier than they had originally imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was stunned. She never expected Jason to use the phrase "good thing" to describe it. "So, does Uncle Reed think I should just distance myself from Mason?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if you don't treat Mason as your brother?" Jason asked in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason continued, "I know Mason's personality, and you do too. If you can fall in love with him, then it's all good. But if you can't, then you should stay away from him for his own good and for your own good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica walked out of the Reed family mansion in a daze. Is it really good for both of them to distance themselves like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why is she feeling so miserable? Why does her heart seem to ache so badly?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why can't she be his sister for life?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once, she hoped to grow up quickly, but now she feels that it would be so much better if people never grew up, so they could remain as close as they used to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back in the Barlow family, when she came to her senses, she found herself in Mason's room, looking at this cold room, with his voice in her ear from the phone - "Veronica, from now on, you are not my Veronica anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No longer Veronica! Not anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So this time, it was him who didn't want her, it was him who left her behind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She walked up to his desk and picked up the photo frame he had placed on it. The photo inside was a picture of them taken together when they were young.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, he was 5 years old and she was 7 years old, at an innocent and naive age. His small body was leaning against hers, and her hand was holding him close to her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said she wanted to be his sister for life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, today, she is no longer his sister!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow!" She suddenly burst into loud sobs, holding the photo frame tightly to her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tears kept rolling down her face, wetting it completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't want this, she didn't want to feel this way, but she didn't know what to do... and no one came to tell her how to feel better, how to make her heart... hurt less!</p></div>
