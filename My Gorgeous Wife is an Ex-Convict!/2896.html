        <h1>Chapter 2894</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated for a moment, but ultimately did not pull her hand back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them entered the amusement park, and Brian Hart asked, "Don't you want to know why I asked you to come here with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you wanted to tell me, you would have. If you don't want to, then I don't need to ask. Besides, everyone has things they don't want to talk about," Valda Theller replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you? Have you been here before?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I came here a lot when I was a child," Valda Theller said. "There were a lot of interest classes near the amusement park back then. When my parents were still alive, they signed me up for some of them. Every weekend, I would go to the interest classes and my parents would bring me here to play a few rides before taking me home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A hint of envy appeared in his eyes. "You must have been very happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was indeed very happy," she said. Those joyful moments she spent with her parents were now her most precious memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they walked into the amusement park, many parents were there with their children, mostly preschool to elementary school age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching the children follow their parents, Valda Theller's eyes couldn't help but become moist. The memories of being with her parents here, which she thought had become blurred, now seemed to be becoming clearer and clearer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? Your eyes are red," Brian Hart said, touching her eyes with some tenderness. "I didn't bring you here to make you cry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just thought of the scenes when I was with my parents before," Valda Theller said. "I'm fine, but thank you for bringing me here and reminding me of so many things I did with my parents."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, pulling Brian Hart's hand. "Let's continue walking." Then she walked ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart glanced at his fingers, which still retained the warmth of her touch. He lifted his feet and caught up with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the two of them arrived at a mobile ice cream truck, Valda Theller looked at the displayed ice cream, which looked like the kind she had when she was a child, and it made her nostalgic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Two please," Brian Hart said to the ice cream vendor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two ice creams came into Brian Hart's hands, and he handed one to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked a little dazed and did not take it. "Don't you want to eat it?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," she denied, taking the ice cream from his hand. "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they ate their ice cream, Valda Theller occasionally glanced at Brian Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? Is there something I did?" he asked. She rarely looked at him like this these days, and it made him feel like he was back in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she would always look at him, letting him know that she loved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just the first time I've seen you eat ice cream. It's a bit...unexpected," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it because you think I'm too high-class to eat this kind of ice cream? If you take away my family background and all the external factors, I'm just an ordinary person who eats ordinary things and likes ordinary things," Brian Hart said, turning the ice cream in his hand. "I remember the first time I came to this amusement park, I sneaked out alone. I saw a few of my classmates here, but when they saw me, they didn't play with me, but played together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is your relationship with your classmates not good?" she guessed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"At that time, except for those who worshiped me in my circle, other classmates were actually afraid to approach me. Once, I played with a classmate, but he accidentally bumped into me and scraped my arm. The next day, he transferred to another school," Brian Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller fell silent.</p></div>
