        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Warm water is fine," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, okay," she replied, quickly pouring him a glass of warm water and carefully carrying it to the coffee table in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you nervous?" His voice suddenly rang out, causing her hand to shake and the water in the glass to spill onto the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-I'm sorry!" she stuttered, quickly grabbing two tissues to wipe the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her panicked movements, he asked again, "Are you nervous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but grip the tissues tightly in her hand. Her heart was pounding so hard that it felt like her blood was rushing to her face. Even her voice was stuttering. All of this seemed to be saying that she was nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Is this question inconvenient to answer?" His voice rang out again, his dark </span><span>eyes staring at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart beat faster and harder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took a deep breath and met his gaze. "Yes, I'm very nervous."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" he asked, as if it was just a simple question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because... we haven't faced each other calmly like this and had a good conversation for several years. And, you... haven't been in this room for a long time," she hesitated and continued, "And, you were in this room from last night until this morning."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I was. " He said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt a little embarrassed and said, "Yes, I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you thought about how we should try?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at him blankly, "Huh?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or are you going to back out?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly shook her head, "No, I'm not going to back out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're not planning to back out, how do you plan to start?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him, how to start... she actually hadn't thought about this question. At that time, she just didn't want to let him go no matter what!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was afraid that if she let go, she would never be able to hold onto him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you want to try with me?" She bit her lip and asked this question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her as she bit her lip harder with her teeth, "You don't like me now, do you?" She knew his hypnotic effect hadn't worn off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, in terms of emotions, his feelings towards her were like those of a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I don't like you," he said, "So I want to know why I liked you in the first place."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And why, even though he no longer had feelings for her, his emotions were still influenced by her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lowered her head and after a long while said, "So... can we start getting along like we used to? We can meet often, have meals together, or just chat whenever you're free."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blinked, "Isn't that enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, what if I want to take our relationship further?" he asked.</span></p></div>
