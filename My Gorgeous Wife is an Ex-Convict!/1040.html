        <h1>Chapter 1039</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because I&rsquo;ve had too many girlfriends? Therefore, she doesn't think I'm serious?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He remembered how she had scorned him for finding so many substitutes. She said if he really missed someone, it did not matter how many substitutes he found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Come to think of it, is this karma?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No woman had ever been so desirable to him as she was, and she was always in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he tried to forget her multiple times, he could never do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm even willing to fight Jason for her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as he was thinking about it, a groan of pain came from the treatment room. Brian immediately stood up and pushed the door open!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the treatment room, the needle knife in Dr. Russell's hand was poking into the back of Grace's hand, while the woman... For a second, Brian could not take his eyes off her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes were closed, her brows were frowning, and her pearly whites were biting her lower lip to stop the cry of pain. Beads of sweat oozed from her forehead and trickled down her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her other untreated hand was clenched into a fist as if she was desperately suppressing the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew she was in a lot of pain now. Since Dr. Russell said that the treatment process would be painful, it would not be some minor pain. It might even be beyond what ordinary people could bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she endured it and remained quiet after the groan he heard earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not that Brian had never seen a woman in pain before. Some films had such scenes, and many actresses performed very well. Some women would even try to get his attention by acting like they were suppressing the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, never had a woman given him such a shock!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Dr. Russell was about to switch to another needle knife, Brian stepped forward and took Grace's clenched hand, putting it on his wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed to be aware of it and slowly opened her eyes. Those almond-shaped eyes were like the surface of a calm lake. It was as if the pain she was enduring had melted in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only the sweat and the pallor on her face testified to the pain she was enduring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What&hellip; are you doing?" she asked slowly with a hint of difficulty and tension in her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hold my hand when you're in pain. You'll feel better," he said. He opened the fingers of her fist little by little and could see the deep nail marks in her palm. If she clenched her fist any harder, she would have injured her palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I can do it... myself," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian stubbornly put her hand on his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, it's time to start again. Stop moving!" Dr. Russell's voice rang. Grace stiffened, and the next moment, the sharp pain on the back of her hand that was receiving treatment resurfaced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She subconsciously clenched her teeth as her free hand almost instinctively grasped Brian's forearm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Ouch! It hurts so much!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gritted her teeth and emptied her mind to endure the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a habit she had developed in prison, where she would let her mind wander when she suffered inhuman torment. She would imagine that she was just an empty shell. It was as if it would hurt less this way!</p></div>
