        <h1>Chapter 128</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Actually, I'm not too sure either," Lina said, "I just bumped into Zoe. She mentioned something about Jason supporting you. She seemed to think that you were together with Jason. However, the only man to have suddenly appeared beside you is Jay. So, I was wondering if the so-called Jay could actually be Jason?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, from Jay's appearance, it was impossible to tell that he was a homeless person. On the other hand, there was no way of finding photos of Jason on the Internet at all. She had searched a while ago and only managed to find some distant images taken from afar or some images of him taken from behind. There was no clear image of his face at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace only felt that the sound of Lina's voice was growing fainter and fainter in her ears.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew that Jay was not an ordinary person, and perhaps he was very rich and noble.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew that she and Jay were people from two different worlds.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, no matter what, she had never imagined that Jay could be Jason.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That's right, Jay... Why hadn't she thought of that before?!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jay... was Jason. Compared to Jennifer Atkinson, the woman who had died in a car accident, the person who had actually caused her more trauma was Jason.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Other people had always said that she had caused the death of Jason's woman so she deserved to suffer.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were also trying to please Jason, so they had to make her miserable and suffer. Just because Jason had once said, "Let her stay well in prison."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Stay well"... That was why others had let her be "well".</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, are you listening?" Lina asked. She felt that the other end of the line had gone unusually silent.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew what that "Jay" meant to Grace. If Jay was really Jason, it would certainly be a heavy blow to Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Lina didn't want her friend to be kept in the dark and taken as a joke. That was why she was making this call.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I... I'm listening." Grace took a deep breath, her body trembling. It seemed that she could hardly hold the phone in her hand. "Lina... I... I'll call you later."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It took her almost all of her strength just to finish the sentence.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh, okay. Grace, don't... don't be too sad," Lina said. At this moment, this was the only thing she could say.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the call ended, Grace silently peered through the glass door and looked at that silhouette. Yes, she had seen Jason's back view on the Internet before. At that time, she had still been thinking that that back view was somewhat similar to Jay's own back view.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">They were simply the same person, so the view of their backs was obviously similar!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I was the stupid one!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She pushed the glass door open silently...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Jason was busy dealing with Patrick on the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What kind of woman could make you leave your family's Old Master on Thanksgiving and immediately go to another town to save her?" Patrick was quite curious.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How do you even know about this?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I happened to meet the deputy director of the police station earlier today. I heard him talking about it."</p></div>
