        <h1>Chapter 2003</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I saved her because she saved Grace before," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If Lina were not Grace's best friend, he probably would not even look twice if she died in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you anyway. I owe you a favor. If you ever need me, I'll help you if I can," said Hadwin Stephenson. It was unusual for a man like him to give such a promise. "I'll drink first!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, he raised his glass and finished it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing this, Jason also raised his glass and downed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you do think that you owe me a favor, then you might as well keep an eye on Lina in the future. Don't let her take Grace to watch strippers and other things like that," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he lowered his volume when he said this so that the two women and four children could not hear him. After all, it was not a good thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's face darkened at the sound of it. He was frustrated with Lina's hobbies too, but he had no way of stopping her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once that woman was affectionate to him and showed him a pitiful look, he would surrender.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would even help her buy tickets, take her to meet her idols, and ask for autographs, posters, and the likes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She seemed to be obsessed with another boy band recently. Hadwin Stephenson suspected that it would not be long before she asked for signed posters, ask to take photos with them, or even ask to meet them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Hadwin Stephenson could only say, "I'll... try my best."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Try your best?" Jason raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She's pregnant. Pregnant women are supposed to be happy, and some things will have to wait until she delivers the baby," Hadwin Stephenson said a little awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Will you really be able to keep an eye on her once the baby is born?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I think so." However, even Hadwin Stephenson could feel his lack of confidence when he said that. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay. Hopefully, we won't meet in a place like that and have to take our own women home again next time," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was speechless, thinking of several &lsquo;unpleasant&rsquo; experiences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"There won't be a next time," replied Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He only hoped Lina's enthusiasm for those idols and celebrities could lessen after she gave birth. He could not help shuddering at the thought of her fangirling with their child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The thought of it was terrifying!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina and Hadwin Stephenson returned to the car after dinner, Lina asked, "What did you and Jason talk about at dinner? You didn't look so good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nothing, just a casual chat," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh, looking at Grace's three children today, I really want our baby to be born and grow up soon so that I can do a lot of things with them," Lina said emotionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do you want to do with the baby?" Hadwin Stephenson asked casually.</p></div>
