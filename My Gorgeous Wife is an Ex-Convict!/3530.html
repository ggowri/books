        <h1>Chapter 3528</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't think too much about it. Your parents are probably looking for us now. Let's not worry them," William said as he took Jasper's hand and led him towards the exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After they left, a figure slowly emerged from a hidden corner, their gaze heavy as they watched the two figures leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Young master, we need to leave now, or we'll miss the plane," someone reminded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go," Lawrence said, but he walked towards the side door. "Those kidnappers who were sentenced today, don't let them have an easy time in prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I understand what to do," his subordinate replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they arrived at the side door, a black car was waiting outside. Lawrence got in and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, he couldn't resist and walked closer, letting Jasper see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now is not the time for him to appear in front of Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, someday he will appear before him, and when that time comes, it will be when she pays the price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper... they will meet again eventually. Lawrence silently thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper returned to the Reed House, but the face and figure he saw at the court today kept flashing through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was that person really not Lawrence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or perhaps, did she misunderstand?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it really is Lawrence, then Lawrence would definitely come to her and fiercely question why she refused to answer his calls back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, if Lawrence is really in Emerald City, which is so close to her, then the people her father sent to search for Lawrence should have noticed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, even though the police have stopped searching for Lawrence, the Reed family never stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Jasper suddenly threw off her thin blanket, got out of bed, and opened the bedroom door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as he was about to knock, William was caught off guard by the door opening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William?" Jasper looked at him with surprise. "Are you looking for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just wanted to see if you were asleep," William said. He was in Emerald City for the trial of the kidnapping case and was temporarily staying with the Reed family. "Can't sleep?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I have something I want to talk to my parents about," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's eyes flickered slightly. "Is it about what you saw in court today, regarding Lawrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper wasn't too surprised when William guessed what she was thinking. After all, they had known each other for many years and he could always easily guess what she was thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, no matter whether the person I saw was Lawrence or not, I still hope my father can help me check it out," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, her father should still be in the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Jasper was about to walk towards the study, William suddenly grabbed her wrist. "Are you still unable to let go of Lawrence? In the afternoon, didn't we already say that you must have mistaken the person and that it couldn't be Lawrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper smiled bitterly. "Should I let go? Back then, I had the chance to save Lawrence, but the result was that he disappeared! And his parents..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop it," said William. "How long are you going to blame yourself for something that wasn't your fault? You were only a few years old at the time. None of this was your responsibility."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But for Lawrence back then, I was like a lifeline," Jasper murmured. "Regardless of whether I was mistaken this time or not, I want to understand what happened!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper pulled his hand away from William's wrist and walked towards the study as he spoke.</p></div>
