        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler!" Hadwin couldn't believe his eyes as he looked at Chandler. "Are you really willing to let Tina see him? Aren't you afraid that he'll say some persuasive words to Tina? What if Tina wavers again, what will you do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, if Tina wants to see Kit, then let her see him. Even if she is really shaken by it and would rather believe a liar, I accept that fact!" Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the weight of these words, only he understood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadwin glanced at his son-in-law, and only then did he deeply understand that Chandler loved Tina more than he had imagined!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you also know what the consequences might be, I won't say anything." Hadwin sighed and patted Chandler's shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina's eyes turned red. This is a test for Chandler, but also a test for Tina!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wonder what will happen when Tina really meets Kit!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina's feelings towards Kit have always been contradictory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On one hand, she is grateful that Kit found Tina and rescued her from the village. But on the other hand, she resents Kit for deceiving Tina, who has lost her memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, no one knows what the consequences will be when Tina and Kit meet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before meeting Kit, Tina first met her own daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting in a wheelchair, she was pushed into the premature baby room, looking at the newborns in the incubators. Then Lina pointed to one of the babies and said, "This is your daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at the tiny, fragile baby still in the incubator, with thin tubes inserted in her nostrils and IV fluids in her hand. She looked small and vulnerable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But another indescribable emotion surged from her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is her child!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A child with blood ties to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This child is very important! Very important!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But is it only because this is her baby that she feels it is important and is willing to protect this child at all costs?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It feels like there is another reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What could that reason be...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina couldn't help but raise her hand and press it against her throbbing forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her head started to hurt at this moment as if there was an answer trying to tell her </span><span>something!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain in her head seemed to be getting worse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's face became paler and sweat, like tiny beads, kept sliding down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her daughter like this, Lina immediately became nervous. "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My head hurts so much..." Tina said in pain, her eyebrows furrowing even more, and the pain on her face becoming more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurse hurriedly went to find a doctor, while Lina and the nurse quickly pushed Tina back to the hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's head continued to ache. When Chandler and Hadwin, who were left in the room, saw Tina like this, their expressions immediately became serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What is going on? Why did Tina become like this?" Hadwin asked urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know either." Lina said, "She just looked at the child, and then Tina suddenly had a headache!" Lina said.</span></p></div>
