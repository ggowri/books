        <h1>Chapter 689</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What kind of job do you want to do?" He had asked at the time, for everything was so easy for him that he did not have to work hard for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like how some people were born with everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides&hellip; &lsquo;Job&rsquo; was a word he had never thought of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this person who was a year or two his junior was already thinking of such things?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I haven't decided yet, but I want to just have a job that&rsquo;ll protect not only myself but also people I like!" she had answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Just?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Being born in an upper-class family, he knew from the influence he received since childhood that there was no absolute justice, and sometimes, the so-called justice was just self-deception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her eyes were so serious that some words seemed stuck in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When time passed and he finally found the little girl, he found that Stella Lindsay did not have the job she mentioned and her eyes no longer held that look of justice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was ironic that there was such a look in Grace's eyes instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to go back to the legal world in the hopes that you can protect not only yourself but also the people you like?" The words escaped from his mouth just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was startled, and suddenly, there was a sharp pain in her head. Then, a young voice seemed to say in her ear, "Even if you don&rsquo;t have a job, I can protect you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm the one protecting you right now, aren't I? Can you stand up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Ouch... My head&rsquo;s hurting again. Who&rsquo;s speaking in my ear?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace saw broken images flashing through her mind. She tried hard to see them clearly, but her efforts were in vain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, what's the matter?" An anxious voice rang in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned her head around. The little boy with the blurry face seemed to flash before her eyes again. Then, it slowly overlapped with the face in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'My head... Is still hurting&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who... Who the hell is&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to see better...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a tremble, Grace raised her hand and leaned closer to Brian's face while she mumbled the word... &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the word seemed to pull him back to his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman's face was pale, and there was something painful in her eyes. Her hand was touching his cheek while she was calling out the name he had warned her never to say again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian suddenly grabbed Grace's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" She let out a cry of pain before immediately realizing that her hand was touching his face.</p></div>
