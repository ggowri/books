        <h1>Chapter 1020</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's voice was stuck in her throat as a flash of embarrassment came over her face. She did not know what to say next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I was..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Stella, you saved my life, so I have no displeasure in helping you change your life. Grace's the person I love. If she needs me to change her life, I'm more than pleased to do so."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella immediately felt a surge of jealousy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's so good about Grace? She even made Brian use such words!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She doesn't love you. Doesn't that matter? She said it herself in the recording!" Stella was eager to grasp this point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, Stella suddenly felt suffocated, and there was a chill rising from the soles of her feet. Those phoenix eyes of his were looking at her coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stella, I hope you won't use such tricks on me again, got it?" Brian exclaimed coolly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella froze immediately! She only felt as if those cold phoenix eyes had seen through her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The day before Nelson started kindergarten was the weekend. Grace and Lina came to Kyla Corbyn's place to give Nelson a gift for getting into kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave him a set of crayons and a sketchbook, while Lina gave him a set of clothes and shoes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After receiving the gifts, the little one blushed and kissed each of them shyly while saying in a cute child-like voice, "Thank you, Aunty and Aunty Sweeney."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's heart almost melted at his cuteness. "Oh my. If I have a daughter, I want you to be my son-in-law!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one blinked his eyes, not knowing what a son-in-law was, but he seemed to understand what &lsquo;having a daughter&rsquo; meant. He looked at Lina's belly. "Are you having a baby, Aunty Sweeney?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At his question, Kyla Corbyn and Grace gazed at Lina's stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're pregnant?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's face reddened. "No&hellip; No! I was just talking metaphorically. Metaphorically. If I had a daughter..." she stammered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Speaking of which, Hadwin Stephenson and I haven't used any contraception the few times we did the deed. Besides&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t seem to have gotten my period this month. Could I be..."'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was instantly stunned and began to wonder whether she was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's on your mind? Why did you become silent?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Lina suddenly came to herself and said hurriedly, "It's nothing. Hehe. I'm just wondering whether Nelson will like my daughter if I do give birth to one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn quipped, "If you do have a daughter, Nelson will adore her very much. I'm just afraid your daughter won't like Nelson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No way. Nelson is so handsome and adorable. I wonder how many little girls will fall in love with him once he starts kindergarten? My daughter will have a lot of competition!" Lina said with a smile. The more she looked at the little one, the more she adored him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at her son who was rubbing his eyes and was apparently a little sleepy. There was a touch of sadness in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She picked her son up and put him on the bed nearby. It was time for the little one to take a nap.</p></div>
