        <h1>Chapter 1733</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was silent. It meant she was betting on three years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So when can we start?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Have you thought it through?" Dr. Russell somewhat admired Grace's decisiveness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes. It's better to undergo treatment now than wait three years till I become crippled," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I need some time. After all, I need to prepare some things." Dr. Russell pondered for a moment and then said, "I'll let you know when I'm ready."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," Grace answered readily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"And I'll give you something for the pain. Your hands must have ached many times this year," said Dr. Russell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace nodded. After she filled her prescription and came out of Dr. Russell's clinic, she was stunned. Brian was standing face to face with another man, who had his back to Grace. However, she knew who it was even without looking at his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her footsteps seemed to attract the attention of the two men. Brian spotted her first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason turned around and looked at her with faint joy in his dark eyes before walking over to her. "Are you done with the consultation for your hands?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, Dr. Russell needs to prepare some things for the treatment. He&rsquo;ll let me know when he's ready," Grace said casually, not wanting Jason to worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then, let's go home first," said Jason as he held Grace's hand naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian did not say a word. Just as they were passing by, he suddenly said, "Jason, can you trust someone completely? If you can't, perhaps you'll both have problems sooner or later even without my intervention!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stopped and glanced at Brian coldly. "Of course, I trust Grace. Don't worry about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As he said this, he squeezed Grace's hand tighter and took her to the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the car slowly drove away from Brian's sight, Brian had a sarcastic look on his face. 'Jason, you were born suspicious... Can you really trust Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If you trust her, you wouldn't have warned me not to go after Grace anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jason's still insecure. Is he afraid that Grace will have feelings for another man or that she doesn't love him enough? Or is he afraid... that Grace will leave him again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the car, Grace asked Jason, "What were you talking about with Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Nothing much." Jason smiled faintly. "We just had a casual chat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car stopped at the traffic light. While waiting for it to turn green, Jason turned and stared intently at Grace, asking, "He can't come between us, can he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace met his dark eyes. "As long as we love each other, no one can come between us." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And Brian will get over me one day.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's smile became even more beautiful just as the red light turned green. He continued driving.</p></div>
