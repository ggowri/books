        <h1>Chapter 320</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina went home, still a little confused. Did she and Hadwin just get into a relationship? She had thought of many possible revenge plans that he might execute, but she did not think of this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not have much experience in dating. She would just follow his pace. If that did not work, there were plenty of idol dramas for reference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the problem was... he wanted her to fall in love with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fall in love with him and then wait for him to dump her? Lina scratched her head a little helplessly. If that really did not work, how about if she pretended to fall in love with him after a few months of dating and pretend to be heartbroken when he dumped her? Then maybe she could put an end to all this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina sighed heavily at the thought. Who would have thought that her first relationship would be started this way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was far better than how she had imagined him taking his revenge on her. She thought he would destroy her family or whatever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was why one should not take advantage of men. One should especially not run away after having their way with them. She was getting her comeuppance now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. and Mrs. Sweeney were still wanted to know why their daughter did not notify them that she was not coming home for dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina rolled her eyes. Did they know that they almost lost their home? She just sold herself to save their family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not good having such a poor sense of time. I've made an appointment with the community's Director Wang to get you on a blind date next week," said Mrs. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina almost spat out a mouthful of blood. She... She just started dating Hadwin and her mom wanted her to go on a blind date?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The community's Director Wang... was famous for being a matchmaker in the community, and she had made several successful matches. Therefore, her mother always hung out with Director Wang, hoping that she could find a good match for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom... Can I find a boyfriend myself? I promise to find one you'll like," said Lina. Of course, even though she said so, she did not intend to tell her parents about her relationship with Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she knew very well that her affair with Hadwin was only for a short time. It would not be long before she &lsquo;broke up&rsquo; with Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, there was no need to tell her family about this. She wanted to save her parents from disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've said this many times. Do you realize you're almost 28? If you don't find a boyfriend now, are you going to wait until you're 30 and become a leftover woman?" Mrs. Sweeney snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina pursed her lip. There were a lot of people who fell in love and got married in their 30s. Being a leftover woman did not mean she had to make do with just anybody. If she was to marry, she would marry someone she liked and was a feast to her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Hadwin's face unexpectedly and involuntarily emerged in her mind at the thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Bah! What was she thinking? Lina quickly shook her head to shake the image of his face out of her mind. Then, she told her parents, "I'm tired!" and hurried into her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she entered the room, she received a text message on her phone. "This is Hadwin. Please save my phone number for easy contact."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina glanced at the unfamiliar phone number and sighed helplessly as she obediently saved the phone number on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she could only take one step at a time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace continued looking for a job but was always turned down at the last stage because of her criminal record.</p></div>
