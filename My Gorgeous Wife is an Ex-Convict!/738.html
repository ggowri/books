        <h1>Chapter 737</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're back. How did the doctor's appointment go?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right." Grace thought for a while and said, "About that headache. If I get it again over time, why don't you get me another doctor?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes glistened a little before replying, "Sure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I just realized that you're interested in making cakes. What made you want to learn it? How long have you been learning?" asked Grace as she looked down at the cake Jason had just decorated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed well decorated. At least to a layman like her, it looked about the same as the ones in the cake shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Reed's a quick learner. He got the hang of it with one lesson." The pastry chef nearby praised Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. That's all for today. You can leave," Jason said to the pastry chef.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He nodded and left the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, only Grace and Jason were left in the spacious kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about you? Did anything happen today other than seeing the doctor?" he asked calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew everything. He knew what she had gone to the hospital for today, and he also knew that she met Brian there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he wanted to hear it from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it pride or self-esteem? Or... Maybe he was expecting her to tell him everything willingly and not keep it from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a flash of discomfort on Grace's face, and she quickly smiled. "Nothing special happened. By the way, why are you making a cake at home? Aren't you supposed to be in the office right now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She digressed from the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You said you wanted a cake for your birthday, so I need to learn ahead of time," he said. His long lashes quivered a little, obscuring all the gloom in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blinked. "Are you&hellip; Going to make me a cake for my birthday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you like it? However, today is just the beginning. I hope the cake I make for you on your birthday tastes good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked shocked. She knew he loved her, but she really did not expect that he would choose to make a cake for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This cake would be more meaningful than any other cake!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I love it," Grace said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It may not taste as good though." Once in a blue moon, Young Master Reed had his moments of worry as well. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if it doesn't taste that good, I&rsquo;ll love it. Because you made it for me, Jay!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her intently and put his arms around her waist. His eyes looked like they were trying to imprint her into his soul. "Grace, I'll only bake cakes for one woman in my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt a little entranced. It was as if she was about to be captured by the look in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't let me down, all right?" His voice was so faint that she could hardly hear it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body trembled, and she saw the fragility in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I the only one who can see his vulnerability?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How can I erase his vulnerability and make him believe more in my love for him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace put her hands around Jason's neck, stood on tiptoe, and kissed him on the lips. "Jason, I'll never betray you. Just as I told you the other day before your father's memorial tablet that I would never betray you!"</p></div>
