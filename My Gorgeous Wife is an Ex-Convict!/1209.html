        <h1>Chapter 1208</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's phone rang over and over again in the mansion's living room. Brian looked down at the ringing phone with a conflicted look but did not pick it up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was from Grace, but he did not know what voice he should use to face her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is she so eager to call me? Is it for Chase Harper&rsquo;s sake? Is she trying to plead for Chase Harper?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Stella, who had just walked in, caught sight of the caller ID on the screen of his phone. She put on a confused look and said, &ldquo;Brian, aren't you going to answer the phone? It's from Grace. But she's probably calling for Chase Harper's case. I met her at the mansion&rsquo;s gate just now. She kept saying that she wants to see you and talk to you. I didn't expect her to be so persistent for Chase Harper!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella deliberately claimed that Grace's reason for standing outside was for Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, the look of struggle on Brian's face faded as he picked up his phone and turned it off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was delighted at this but still said, "Brian, are you sure you won't see Grace? I wonder if Grace's still out there..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said coldly, "That's enough. Stop talking about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace's only doing all this for Chase Harper! Does she really care about the man?' He knew that he was jealous. He was jealous of how much that man meant to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All night, Grace stood there and waited. She had no idea how many calls she had made, but afterward, all she heard was the message &lsquo;The person you're calling is unavailable.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled wryly, her thin body shaking due to the night wind. Even the security guard had come forward to persuade her a few times, but she shook her head and said she wanted to wait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The weariness of her body was constantly sweeping over her. Whenever she was about to lose her footing or felt so sleepy that she wanted to just lay on the road and sleep, she would tell herself that Lina was suffering much more pain and hardships than she was right now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she could not make it now, what about Lina?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea how much time had passed, but dawn broke, and the security guards had switched their shifts. Grace finally saw a silver-gray car driving out of the mansion. With almost all her strength, Grace moved her feet, rushing forward and stopping right in front of the car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car braked to a stop as the security guard rushed over and shouted at Grace, "You're going to kill yourself by rushing over like that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said nothing. She just looked at Brian sitting in the backseat of the car through the car window. She could not see clearly from this angle and could only see Brian&rsquo;s outline. She could not even see his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... would like to see Brian... Bryn, can I?" Grace almost sobbed as she said that. She dared not close her eyes all night in case she missed him, in case she did not see him when he left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that she had finally seen him, she knew that he was her hope! He was Lina's hope of survival!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, Brian also saw Grace through the car window. She looked haggard, and her eyes seemed to be more swollen than usual. Despite everything, her thin body was still stopped in front of the car in this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was shocked and also surprised!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did she stay here all night? I thought she might go home after waiting for a while and failing to come in!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart seemed to be suddenly pricked by something, and he subconsciously wanted to open the car door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Stella suddenly said, "Brian, why don't you step down from the car and promise Grace that you'll let Chase Harper go? I... I can forget about it for your sake. No matter how much Chase Harper hurt me, I won't mind it. Otherwise, I'm afraid that Grace will force you to agree to her request. After all, she cares so much about Chase Harper."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's hand, which was about to open the car door, suddenly stopped when he heard this.</p></div>
