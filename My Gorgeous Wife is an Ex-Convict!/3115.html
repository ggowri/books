        <h1>Chapter 3113</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille looked at Valda with a sly expression, "Did nothing really happen between you and him last night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course...not..." Valda replied, but her answer seemed a bit guilty, and she couldn't forget the words Brian said to her while she pretended to be asleep last night...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each word was like a brand on her mind, unforgettable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From the looks of it, it doesn't seem like nothing happened," Camille muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda bit her lip and gathered her courage to ask, "Can you tell me what Brian was like when I disappeared?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Camille had mentioned a few things to her before, she didn't want to listen because she was afraid it would make her miss him even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, she actively wanted to listen and understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she was unconscious and helpless, he was suffering for her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you suddenly want to know again?" Camille asked in surprise. Previously, when she wanted to say more, her friend had expressed that she didn't want to listen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to know how much he suffered for me." At that time, she also thought she was going to die for sure. Her final wish was for him to live well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she forgot to consider that sometimes, the ones who survive are the ones who suffer the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille sighed as she looked at her friend's serious expression. "Alright, if you want to hear it, I'll tell you. But when I saw Brian, it was already three days after your accident. I rushed over there..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille began to recount what had happened at that time, and Valda listened attentively. Even though she had some mental preparation before listening, her heart still ached badly when Camille mentioned certain details.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her pain, it is not even one percent of the pain he felt at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian returned to the hospital room, he saw that Valda's eyes were red and her face was filled with sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on?" Brian took a quick step forward, anxiously looking at Valda. "Is something wrong? Are you feeling uncomfortable somewhere? Do your legs hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not..." murmured Valda in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened? Or is the pain in another part of your body? I'll go find a doctor right away!" He said, and hurriedly turned to run out of the hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the next moment, Valda suddenly hugged Brian's waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of their relationship, she was sitting and holding onto his waist, burying her face in his abdomen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's body stiffened and he looked at Valda with surprise. "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not a medical issue, I just feel heartache for you," Valda murmured. "Brian, please don't move... let me hold you like this for a while, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian heard her and didn't move, standing quietly as Valda held onto him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille, seeing the situation, tactfully left the room and closed the door behind her.</p></div>
