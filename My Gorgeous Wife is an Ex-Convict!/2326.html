        <h1>Chapter 2324</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned even more. Something seemed to be pressing on his heart, making him feel stuffy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had forgotten his feelings for the woman, but why... did the sight of her make him feel so uncomfortable?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "What's the matter? You can't do it, can you? Kyla, your friend is important to you. Your children are important to you too. But I'm the only one who doesn't matter to you, so why should I say yes? So much for what you call &lsquo;paying whatever price&rsquo;!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He waved her hand away and got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stood there blankly, her hands empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is there really nothing I can do? Is there no way for me to save Amber Mitchell? I can't pay the price Martin Weiss is asking me to, but what about Amber Mitchell... What will happen to Amber Mitchell?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was what Jacqueline Bowman said true?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only sob helplessly now. Kyla lowered her head as her shoulders quivered slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's car slowly drove away. Martin Weiss looked at Kyla's shrinking figure in the rearview mirror and suddenly closed his eyes, telling himself not to think about it anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This woman shouldn't be making me so emotional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I've forgotten all about our relationship, haven't I?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His back leaned heavily against the back seat, and he reached out one hand to place over the spot where his heart was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But why is it beating so violently?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was beating so violently as if it was announcing something...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Distracted, Kyla walked in the direction of the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She held a glimmer of hope when she came to look for Martin Weiss today, but it shattered when Martin Weiss mentioned their two children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out she was so useless that she could not do anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, there were panicked footsteps behind her. A familiar voice rang out. "Kyla, what are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked up only to see Chase Harper appear in front of her. There was instantly a flash of surprise on her face. "What are you... doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, I have a business deal here. I drove the car to L City from Emerald City to deliver it today. What about you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm here to meet a friend on some business," mumbled Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Chase Harper did not ask any more questions. He only asked worriedly, "Where are you going? Do you want me to drive you? It's not safe for you to walk alone in the streets while pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. It&rsquo;s just a short walk back to the hotel. It&rsquo;s not far from here,&rdquo; said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I walk with you? I've delivered the car anyway, so it's alright," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated a little and did not refuse his offer again. The two of them walked to Kyla's hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't seem to be in a good mood. Is something upsetting you? Why don't you tell me about it? Maybe I can help," said Chase Harper.</p></div>
