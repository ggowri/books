        <h1>Chapter 1528</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help but blush at the thought of her previous bold actions in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Well, she did not think she would have done that either... but everything seemed second nature after seeing Jay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... she had forgotten that there was a group of people waiting outside the car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, when she got out of the car to take her daughter with her, those people were looking at her with suggestive glances, wondering what they had just been doing in the car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her daughter was even more straightforward as she asked, "Mommy, why were you in the car with Daddy for so long? Were you telling Daddy a story?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace almost choked. She would tell her daughter stories to distract her when she was upset!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, it became a habit over time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her daughter probably thought Jason cried because he was sad, so she went to tell her sad daddy a story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes... Yes... I was just telling Daddy a story," Grace could only answer her daughter awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she said this, the people around her looked at her more suggestively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Grace returned to Reed Residence, the former maids were all shocked when they saw her. The butler, Uncle Kwan, was even more agitated. "Young Madam, you're alive... You&rsquo;re really alive! Wonderful. You're not dead! You're not dead!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Yes, Uncle Kwan. I'm alive. Sorry, I promised you I wouldn&rsquo;t leave Jay, but I still..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oh, it's good enough that you're alive. It's good enough you're alive!" Uncle Kwan said with red eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason went upstairs after returning to Reed Residence. Grace looked at the butler and Terrence, who had also returned to Reed Residence. She asked, "Jay keeps saying I left him. What the hell happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as she said this, Uncle Kwan and Terrence's eyes instantly widened as they looked at Grace in surprise."Don't you remember?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I... I lost my memories. It was only in these two years that I gradually remembered some things from before. I finally remembered Jay a week ago and came back to Emerald City." Grace briefly told them about her situation and finally said, "The last memory I got back was spending New Year's Eve with Jay, but I can't recall anything else after that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was like she had blacked out after getting drunk and could not remember.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Uncle Kwan and Terrence looked at each other. Finally, Terrence said to Grace, "So you&rsquo;ve lost your memories too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What do you mean 'too'?" Grace frowned. 'Could it be...' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Has Jay also..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence said, "Yes, Young master Reed has also lost his memories, but he hasn't recalled anything yet. What he knows about you is what we told him afterward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But how can it be so coincidental that he lost his memory when I lost mine too?" Grace only found it unbelievable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's no coincidence that Young master Reed lost his memory," said Terrence. There were only Terrence, Uncle Kwan, and Grace in the living room. That was why Terrence dared to speak about it.</p></div>
