        <h1>Chapter 2058</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla suddenly laughed. Her laughter grew louder and louder until she began to choke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She took a while to stop choking. The corners of her eyes were still wet with tears. "Martin Weiss, you want me to marry you?" Her voice was sarcastic like she had just heard the best joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's face darkened. "Yes, I want you to marry me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How could you... say that so easily?" The words were almost squeezed through her teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said what she used to long for the most under such circumstances! How could he? How dared he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I know it was all my fault! Kyla, not a day went by in the past five years that I don't regret it! I... I'm not asking you to fall in love with me again someday, but... let me take care of you and our son, okay? I want to give you a better life. I don't want anyone to bully you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said coldly, "No thanks, Mr. Weiss! If you&rsquo;re asking me to stay to say this, I can tell you this right now. Martin Weiss, I won't marry you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that, she turned around to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He grabbed her wrist again. "Do you want Nelson to keep on being discriminated against and bullied like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla quivered. What he said seemed to strike her at her weak spot, causing a crack in her heavily armed armor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson was more important to her than her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing that she was silent, Martin Weiss said, "Let me send you home first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks. I can go home myself!" she said, trying to break free from his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Martin Weiss shoved Kyla into the passenger seat anyway. He drove toward her store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car was quiet as Kyla looked at the road ahead. Her calm face was expressionless, but her heart was in a flurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What he just said kept playing back like a recording.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car stopped at the store&rsquo;s entrance. Kyla unbuckled the seat belt to get down, but Martin Weiss suddenly leaned over, grabbed her, and said, "I meant what I said today. Think about it. I'll wait for your reply."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla pressed her lips together and said nothing. She only pulled her hand out, opened the car door, and got out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once her figure disappeared from his sight, Martin Weiss looked down at his hands with a wry smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'How I wish... I can hold her and keep her from leaving. I want her to stay by my side and protect her from everything.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It turned out one would need a lifetime to fix a mistake one made!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew how much she wanted nothing to do with him, but he was now using the matter of other kids bullying Nelson to force her back to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I want her so badly! I want everything about her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, come back to me. This time, I&rsquo;ll take good care of you! I won't let any harm come to you..." There was a murmur in the silent car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn and Nelson were waiting for her when Kyla reached home. Mrs. Corbyn was relieved to see her return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He... didn't do anything to you, did he?" Mrs. Corbyn asked anxiously.</p></div>
