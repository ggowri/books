        <h1>Chapter 610</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Go to a hotel&hellip;&rdquo; Evelyn had mixed feelings after the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been in the entertainment industry for several years. She was not so innocent that she did not know what it meant to go to a hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was the only way out for her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, as Brian's ex-girlfriend, many people would probably be interested in her body. The director was also a big name in the industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she was now tacitly blacklisted in the entertainment industry, it did not mean that she had no chance to rise again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all right if the director who had given her a call earlier gave her some bar performances or behind-the-scenes work. She only had to wait a little while until things with Brian settled down. Then, she would still have a chance to rise again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of this, Evelyn secretly made up her mind. Although the director was over 40 years old and married, she could still blackmail him when he wanted her to get on the casting couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she secretly videotaped them doing the nasty, she did not have to be afraid of the director not giving in when she had proof.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would have a way to force him into making her a star or even giving her money to squander! She would let those who despised, ridiculed, and stepped on her these days to look up at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must climb back to the top of the entertainment industry... By hook or by crook!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn got up, picked out an outfit from her wardrobe that she had worn on a date with Brian before, changed into it, and left for the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the hotel, it was the director who opened the door. Evelyn took off her hat, sunglasses, and mask after entering the room. After stripping off all her disguise, she smiled sweetly at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He asked her how she had been doing lately and Evelyn aggrievedly said that she was not doing well. She mentioned she would be moving away from Emerald City soon. Then, she asked the director for help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director agreed, saying that he could help introduce Evelyn to new jobs and promote her in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've always had high hopes for you, Evelyn," the director said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could Evelyn not know what he had in mind? She immediately complied half-reluctantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Out of the corner of her eye, Evelyn peered at her bag which was set aside. It had a special camera that could secretly record this scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they were done, she would have something to threaten him with. Even if he refused to make her a star, she would force him to do it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just when the two were having a good time on the bed, the door of the hotel room was brutally kicked open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone frantically filmed the two who were on the bed with a phone while a woman rushed up to the bed, grabbed Evelyn by the hair, and gave her a series of slaps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was dumbfounded by the slaps. 'What's... What's going on here? Why did these people break into the room? The woman who&rsquo;s hitting me... Wait, this woman looks like the director's wife!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What a shameless couple! You're such a b*tch, Evelyn. You couldn't wait to climb onto my husband's bed when Brian had only gotten rid of you for a few days?" she said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn hurriedly wanted to wrap herself in the quilt, but the people who had come with the woman would not let her have her way. They pulled Evelyn and the director straight out of bed while they were still naked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their phones were pointed at the two, and the filming never stopped.</p></div>
