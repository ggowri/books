        <h1>Chapter 3294</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So they agreed to this solution?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What else can we do? I made it clear that I won't help Wilona pay back the money, so they can only do this for now," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason chuckled softly, "I thought you would help her repay this money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, 7.5 million is not a big deal for families like theirs, and Jasper and Lawrence get along well. He thought that with her sympathy, she would eventually pay the money because she felt sorry for Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't help repay gambling debts. If I do it this time, it will only encourage her to continue gambling and become even worse. By not helping, it's like a warning to her and will make her think twice before gambling again. Also, the things I said to the debt collectors will likely spread, and people outside will know that the Reed family is not her support. In the future, she may not even be able to borrow money for gambling." Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hopes that Wilona can quit gambling, otherwise if things continue like this, the Abbott family may be ruined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think she can appreciate your good intentions? Maybe she's even hating you right now," Jason reminded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It doesn't matter, I'm just worried about Lawrence's future days," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're really worried about this child, then worst case scenario, the Reed family can take care of him in the future. It's not difficult to make sure he has no connection with the Abbott family anymore," Jason said. He was willing to make her wish come true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace shook her head and said, "After all, they are family. I like Lawrence, but it's not necessary for them to be separated permanently. I hope Wilona can remember this lesson today. For now, let's have Lawrence and Jasper's piano lessons separated for a while. After this matter has settled down, we can let the two children have lessons together again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I'll follow your lead." Jason said, taking Grace's hand and kissing her fingertips. "Now that we've discussed the important matters, should we listen to what I have to say next?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In those beautiful peach blossom eyes, there is a deep desire flashing at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After being married for many years, his gaze naturally made her understand. "Okay, I'll listen to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As her voice trailed off, he immediately scooped her up and carried her towards the large bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter how many years have passed, her attraction to him remains so strong that he feels he will never be enough for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grace, I love you," he whispered as he kissed her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I love you just the same," she replied, loving him more and more every day!</p></div>
