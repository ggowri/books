        <h1>Chapter 3012</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Purple used to be Grace's color to me," Brian said. "When Grace saved me before, I promised to give her a purple dress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But later on, I lost touch with her. For many years after that, I kept searching for her. Every year, I would buy a dress and keep it in my closet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over the years, perhaps without realizing it, it became a kind of obsession. But after finding her, or rather... after I found out that she truly loved Jason, I never bought a purple dress again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He spoke these words to her that he had never spoken to anyone before, "Valda, I am more aware than anyone else that Grace is just passing through my life. And as for these dresses, I will have them all cleared out of the villa shortly and they will not remain here any longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But how do you plan to deal with these dresses?" Valda asked. "You can't possibly give them to Grace again. But if you burn them, bury them, or store them away in a box, it would feel like a waste."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian didn't say anything because he hadn't really figured out how to deal with these dresses yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He just didn't want her to see the dresses, fearing that it might cause misunderstandings between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's just leave it here for now. When you've decided how you want to handle it in the future, we can deal with it then," said Valda. "These are things that once held emotional value for you, and I don't think they should be treated lightly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked up at him and said, "Brian, I love you, so I will also accept the emotions you have experienced in the past. In fact, I am grateful to Grace for saving you back then. Otherwise, I wouldn't have met such a wonderful you now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really not mind these dresses?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I said that I want to wear a purple formal dress to the Reed family's banquet, would you agree?" she asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her fixedly, and after a moment, he opened his mouth and said, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian took Valda to a high-end formal dress store that features dresses designed by many famous designers from both domestic and international markets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take a look around this store and see if there's anything you like. You can choose anything, even if it's purple." Brian said to Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me take a look," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This store, she had seen some related introductions in some fashion magazines before, but it was her first time actually walking into it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, as she looked at the dazzling array of dresses, she couldn't help but ask herself why she had chosen a purple dress for this banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It sounds like a fit of anger or frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Actually, she doesn't have a particular preference for purple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at the dresses displayed in the glass showcase and on the shelves. She raised her hand and asked the staff to help her pick a few dresses, which she tried on to see how they looked on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These dresses are very pretty, but none of them really caught her fancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a deep purple formal dress caught her eye.</p></div>
