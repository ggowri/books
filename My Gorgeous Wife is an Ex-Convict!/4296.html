        <h1>Chapter 4294 Rejection</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Start over?" Chandler was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, start over!" Tina said with great certainty. At this moment, she suddenly became nervous, holding her breath, and waiting for his answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at the person in front of him, and time seemed to stand still.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, after her amnesia, they had also talked about starting over, but that ended with a divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she didn't submit the papers in the end, they were still legally married.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for him, it was already over. He had even figured out how to live his days without her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, she was suggesting starting over again...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could they really start over?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he agreed now, then...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly raised his hand and reached towards her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's eyes flickered, but she didn't avoid his hand. However, when Chandler's hand was about to touch her face, it stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he was struggling. After a long time, his fingers slowly curled up and he withdrew his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, I don't want to start over with you." He made his decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was stunned. "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To me, marriage and divorce are not a joke. Even though we signed the divorce agreement back then, even though we are still legally married now, we are already divorced in my mind." Chandler said, "I appreciate your good intentions. I know you want to save me and make me feel better, that's why you suggested starting over. But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler paused, looking at her with a heavy gaze. "I don't need sympathy and pity. Have you forgotten who I am? I am from the Hunter </span><span>family,</span><span> I don't need this kind of sympathy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was shocked. Yes, he was the heir of the Crypt families - the Hunter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That represented immense wealth and power behind him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Men like Chandler naturally have their pride.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he has always been gentle in front of her, never showing his own pride, and sometimes even humble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the point where she forgot about this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I already understand why you came today, and I think you understand too. If there's nothing else, please leave. I have a lot of work to do," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina bit her lip, wanting to say something else, but not knowing what to say!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she walked out of Chandler's office, she felt a heavy feeling in her heart, as if something was weighing her down, and yet it also felt like there was an empty corner, making her want to grasp onto something to fill it, but not knowing what to grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is it like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she was nervous while waiting for his answer, she never thought that he would actually refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he did refuse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This seems to be the first time he has truly refused her request since she lost her memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, no matter what request she made, he always agreed, always smiled, and said "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when she asked for a divorce, he agreed so gently!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, when it concerns his life, he refuses!</span></p></div>
