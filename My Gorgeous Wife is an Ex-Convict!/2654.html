        <h1>Chapter 2652</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was still a little dazed. What started as flirting became something else in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was ruthless and murderous at that moment. Even as an onlooker, she had cold sweat breaking out on her palms and was terrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the glass in his hand would have broken the bones of that woman's hand at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Scared?" The elegant voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller finally came to her senses. Brian had become his normal self again. It was as if his behavior earlier was only her illusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said honestly, "A little. You felt like a different person just now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't like women casually touching me," Brian said with a hint of disgust in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller frowned. 'In that case, I...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if reading her mind, he said, "You're an exception. You're my girlfriend now. You can hold my hand and hug me. It would be strange if you don&rsquo;t do that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'In other words, I can't touch him anymore when I'm no longer his girlfriend!' Valda Theller thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you have crippled the woman's hands if she didn&rsquo;t leave?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think?" he asked instead of replying to her question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Okay, maybe he really would have!' Valda Theller thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After drinking another cocktail, Valda Theller got up and went to the washroom. However, when she walked out after she was done, she met the woman Brian had scared away in the corridor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The difference was that several men were standing beside the woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brother De, this is the woman who embarrassed me. You gotta get justice for me!" the woman said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man named Brother De was holding the woman, looking as if he owned the place. "Someone like her embarrassed you? Tell me what you want me to do to her!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman stared at Valda Theller, her eyes full of malice. "I'll take both of her hands." Her hand still hurt. Since she almost lost her hands earlier, she wanted the woman who watched earlier to suffer something worse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller finally understood what it meant by &lsquo;unexpected disaster&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, I don't think I have any beef with you, do I?" she said as she glared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Weren't you smug when you enjoyed the show just now? Now, it's my turn to watch," the woman said. Apparently, the woman hated Valda Theller more instead of Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller frowned. She was alone now, and there were several of them. She looked over, and someone was blocking the front of the corridor. It was obvious that they were one of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those who had come out of the washroom behind her retreated back into the washroom after seeing what was going on. It was obvious that they did not want trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was impossible to get out of that corridor now. Perhaps she would not even make it through. The only way she could save herself now was probably...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller suddenly turned around and rushed back into the washroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those people froze slightly before immediately following her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller rushed into the female washroom while shouting for help. Then, she pushed the doors of the cubicles. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she pushed open the door of a vacant cubicle, she instantly went inside and closed the door behind her. She pressed her back against the door at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thump! Thump!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of kicks against the door sounded, and Valda Theller felt as though her insides were about to be crushed. She was just glad that the materials the bar used in the construction of this place were good enough and the door was strong.</p></div>
