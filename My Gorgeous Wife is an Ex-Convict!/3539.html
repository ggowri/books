        <h1>Chapter 3537</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William didn't show any surprise on his face. After all, he knew from the beginning that she would apply to Stanford University. It was precisely because he knew that he also chose Stanford University.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then study hard and let's both get into Stanford University," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Jasper replied, "then we can be alumni and see each other every day!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, we can see each other every day," William murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After years of effort, he was finally going to start making progress, and once he got to college, he would work hard to make her understand love, and then... make her fall in love with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As expected, Jasper and William both got into Stanford University after the annual college entrance examination, but Jasper was in the music therapy department.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was a little surprised that Jasper chose this department, as he thought he would choose something like the piano department.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are you thinking of studying music therapy? Do you plan on becoming a therapist?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper nodded in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why?" William was confused. "With your talent, wouldn't it be better for you to become a pianist? Besides, you love playing the piano, don't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I do love playing the piano and performing, but I don't want to rely on it as my livelihood. Also, I think using music to treat special patients is a good thing," she said. "Music can not only make people happy, but it can also help treat some illnesses. Isn't that great?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, he had a feeling that this young girl in front of him might be more mature and decisive than he had imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about your parents? What do they say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They support my decision," she smiled. "I hope that after I graduate, I can become a good therapist and help many people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You will, definitely," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William studied in The Department of Business Administration at Stanford University. They were not in the same department, and the teaching buildings were quite far apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Stanford University is very large. There are several dining halls alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, as long as there are no special circumstances, William will always accompany Jasper to have meals together at school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On their first day at Stanford University, they caused a sensation throughout the school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the eldest princess of the Reed family and the young master of the Barlow family, who have been childhood sweethearts, are like the prince and princess in a fairy tale world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially since the two of them are both beautiful, with the girl being stunning and the boy being handsome, when they walk together, they look like idols in a drama.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, after entering university, Jasper did not apply to live off-campus or in an independent dormitory, but chose a regular dormitory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to her idea, since she's going to college, she should also experience her college life to the fullest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Living in a 4-person dormitory is also a part of college culture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Naturally, when the other girls in the dormitory found out that Jasper was actually their roommate, they were all collectively shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, who would have thought that the princess of the Reed family would live in such an ordinary dormitory and even become their roommate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When William came to the girls' dormitory to find Jasper, it caused a commotion throughout the entire building.</p></div>
