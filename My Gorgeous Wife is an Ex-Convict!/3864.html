        <h1>Chapter 3862</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You said you want to have several children, hoping to have both boys and girls," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When did I..." Veronica's voice suddenly stopped because she remembered that she had indeed said such words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But...that was when she was still in elementary school and watching cartoons with him. She didn't expect him to remember it all along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We will definitely have several children, both boys and girls," Mason said. "However, no matter how many children we have, the person you love the most must be me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica blinked her eyes. Was he trying to make her jealous of...their future children?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isn't it too early to talk about this now?" she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's better to say it earlier than later, isn't it?" he raised an eyebrow slightly. "What, can't you do it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica thought seriously. It is said that maternal love is the greatest love in the world, and many mothers will do anything for their children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But for Mason, she can also do anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know how much love I will have for my children in the future, and I don't know if I would choose you or them if I had to make a choice," Veronica said frankly, not wanting to evade the question. "But I do know that I love you, and this love will only grow deeper. To me, you are a more precious existence than my own life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason smiled slightly. Even though he was stubborn and paranoid in matters of the heart, after hearing her words, he seemed to be able to accept some kind of compromise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's enough, Veronica. You are the person I love the most, no matter what. Don't forget this, and don't underestimate your own life, because your life is not only related to you, but also to mine," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was stunned. His words sounded like a declaration of "dying together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was he telling her that if something really happened to her, he would follow her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, her heart felt heavy, and her throat felt like it was blocked by something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they were young, he was like this. All his emotions were directed towards her, and this heavy feeling of love was sweet to her, but it also came with a sense of responsibility and duty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So she wanted to protect him. Since she met him when she was young, she wanted to protect him with all her might.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even now, he is taller, more capable, and stronger than her, and he may become even stronger in the future, but her thoughts have not changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't underestimate my own life, because I still have to protect you. I promised you that I would protect you for the rest of my life," Veronica murmured, feeling tired as a yawn escaped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, you did," Mason whispered. "Okay, it's late. Let's sleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the voice fell, he pressed the remote switch in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The light went out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica closed her eyes and soon fell asleep, but her hand was still holding Mason's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's lips gently approached their clasped hands and kissed her wrist tenderly. "You protected me in the first half of our lives, let me protect you in the second half."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Until the end of their lives!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p></div>
