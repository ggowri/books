        <h1>Chapter 1590</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The way she looked at him and every word she said caused him severe pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Ah!" He suddenly opened his eyes, and what he saw was darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His head was still in constant pain. The more painful it was, the more fragments of memories swarmed into his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason clenched his teeth tightly to suppress his desire to scream due to the pain. He did not want to disturb the woman sleeping next to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was still sound asleep. Perhaps she was tired today, she was deep in slumber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason almost staggered out of bed. With all his strength, he went to the next room linked to theirs. He opened the door and closed it with difficulty before falling to the ground, gasping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Ouch... My head hurts so much it feels like it's going to burst...' The pain spread to his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The doctor had said that the process for him to recover his memories might be more painful than ordinary people. He would get a headache every time he remembered something from the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he had never been in such pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It hurt so much that... he seemed to be losing even his rationale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His hands clutched his head, his fingers almost sinking into his skull. Groan after groan escaped his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I... I can't...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I can't be too loud. I'll... I'll wake Grace up!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He shut his mouth and bit his lip, letting the blood trickle down the corners of his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Grace... Grace...' He repeated her name over and over again in his heart. Those fragments of memories flashed through his mind as though they were going to tear his soul apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On the bed in the other bedroom, Grace was still sound asleep, unaware of the movements next door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">One side was heaven, while the other was hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The sun fell on Grace's face through the window. When she slowly opened her eyes, what she saw was the familiar figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason, dressed in a black shirt and long pants, was staring at her with a complicated look. There seemed to be joy, an earnestness of having found a lost treasure, and fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, when she tried to look more closely, his eyes returned to the way they usually looked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What time is it?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's past ten o'clock," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was shocked. "Ten o'clock? Why didn't you wake me up sooner? Mick and Jasper's breakfast&hellip; And..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "They've already had breakfast. I had someone send them to kindergarten. I didn't let them wake you because you were sound asleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She suddenly seemed to recall something. "Why aren't you at work?" It was not a rest day today. He should have gone to work by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I want to rest at home today," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace just realized that his face looked a little haggard, and his voice was a little hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Is there something wrong? Is your headache from yesterday any better?" she asked as she sat up and reached toward his head.</p></div>
