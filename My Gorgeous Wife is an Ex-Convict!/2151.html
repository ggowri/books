        <h1>Chapter 2149</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Have you ever thought that if it weren't because of Tina Stephenson, the little boy wouldn't have saved Lina even when Hadwin Stephenson knelt to him? And if something does happen to you, who can I kneel to and beg to save you? If something does happen to you and I can save you by kneeling and begging, I would kneel and kowtow a million times, but... there's no guarantee. I don't want to make a bet for that small possibility."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said, his voice already sobbing. He had never spoken in such a tone to anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was the only one!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla remained motionless, not wanting to bother with everything Martin Weiss had said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Martin Weiss suddenly knelt in front of Kyla with a thump. There were instantly gasping sounds all around them. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, Hadwin Stephenson knelt to that boy to get Lina to wake up. I... I'll kneel to you too. I just want you to think more about your own safety, okay?" He begged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was only then that Kyla finally opened her eyes and looked condescendingly at Martin Weiss, who was kneeling in front of her. "I'm a human being. How can I be a human being if I can't decide what I want to do with my body and let you control me instead?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I have my judgments and decisions. I don't need anyone else to decide for me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, if you treat me as a human being and an equal, you wouldn't be doing this to me today!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You keep saying it's for my own good, but it's actually for yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What she said made it impossible for him to retort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the use of you kneeling before me now? Can you just give up aborting this baby and let me go? If you can't do that, all your tears will only be crocodile tears," Kyla said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Dejection flashed across Martin Weiss's face. He had finally brought the two of them a little closer, but they were now further apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She held hatred, contempt, and indifference for him... There was no love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'She lost her love for me long ago, and I was the one who destroyed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Now, I once again ruined the possibility that she might one day love me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Yes, I keep asking her to believe that I love her, but all I&rsquo;ve done is only making her lose her trust in me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss got up slowly and looked at the person he loved the most in his life. He seemed to have made up his mind. "Do you really want to take a bet? Even if you win, your body will be damaged, and your health can't be guaranteed. Perhaps it'll burden you for life. Are you still going to risk having this baby?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why are you asking me this now? Have you not condemned this baby to death?" Kyla said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Just answer me, yes or no?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She stared at him with a slight change in her expression. "Yes," she answered.</p></div>
