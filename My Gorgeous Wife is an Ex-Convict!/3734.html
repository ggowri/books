        <h1>Chapter 3732</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was stunned, realizing that all the cars from the Reed family were luxury cars with high values. She broke out in a cold sweat and said, "Never mind, forget I said anything. So, what do you want to do now, read?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wondered if he planned to have their first date in the library.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've read enough for now," he closed the book and stood up. "You mentioned before that you wanted to find some books, so let's go look for them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't expect him to remember something she had said unintentionally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them arrived at the borrowing hall on the first floor of the library. Veronica found the books she needed while Mason followed her and kept her company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um, I still need to look for a while. Why don't you find an empty seat and wait for me? I'll come find you when I'm done," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need," he refused decisively. "You keep looking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh," she responded, feeling like she had grown a little tail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to be her little tail, following her wherever she went.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, this "little tail" was attracting too much attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There weren't many people in the library yet, but him following her around had already caught the attention of many.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica glanced at Mason beside her and thought about how he used to be looked at like this by many girls. In elementary, middle, and high school, there were many girls who secretly liked him, and even some who had the courage to confess to him face-to-face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he must have had many women who liked him while he was abroad. What about his feelings towards those women...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you thinking about?" Mason's voice suddenly sounded in her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was thinking if you had any women you liked in these past few years," she said, only realizing what she had said after the words had left her mouth. She was suddenly embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was she even saying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I had someone I liked, would I still be standing here with you?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned, just staring at his lips moving as he said, "I won't easily like someone again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And those words made her heart suddenly ache, reminding her of the pain she had caused him before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, has he never liked anyone in these years? But now he is getting along with her like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her feelings for him used to be sisterly, it seems to be slowly changing after these years. Even after some intimate actions between them, she would have a fluttering feeling, wanting to press him down, wanting to be more intimate with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So...she likes him, right? It's the kind of liking between a man and a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what about him--"What about me? Will you still like me?" She murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know, maybe yes, maybe no," Mason said lightly, "so I'm trying to get along with you now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah." She laughed, it seems that she really asked a silly question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She can truly discover her feelings for him in such a short time because over the years, she has never forgotten the feelings between them. Instead, with the passage of time, it has become deeper and more yearning...</span></p></div>
