        <h1>Chapter 4157 Returning to the Hunter Family</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Seeing Chandler's expression soften, Tina continued, "Chandler, I want to understand you more, see more of your extended family where you grew up, and also your grandfather. Last time, I didn't have a chance to properly greet him. Oh, by the way, are your parents also at the estate this time? It's been so long since I've seen them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina tugged at Chandler's sleeve and acted cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Usually, whenever she acted cute, he would almost always agree to whatever she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Of course, Tina's ability to act cute has been evaluated by her good friend Eugenia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina, not to be mean, but with that kind of dignified face, making a cute expression... uh, it really gives me goosebumps. Only Chandler can fall for your act!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Of course, in response to her friend's teasing, Tina simply acted even cuter, giving her friend an even stronger case of goosebumps!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Alright then, I'll let my family know and we'll visit our old estate this weekend," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "That's great!" Tina exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When the weekend came, Chandler went to see Tina and saw her carrying many bags and belongings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He couldn't help but frown and ask, "What are you doing with all that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It's a gift for our visit. I can't just show up empty-handed," she explained. After all, this time they were going to the Hunter family estate openly, not sneaking in like before, so proper etiquette was necessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, when it came to their daughter going to the Hunter family estate, Lina and Hadwin kept reminding her to be polite to her elders, to not be careless, and to follow the rules.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> On the other hand, they warned their future son-in-law to take good care of Tina, not to let her be mistreated in any way. Furthermore, going to the estate did not mean they would immediately get married. When they would get married still depended on their daughter's wishes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin insisted on this because he wanted to give his daughter more time. He wanted her to make this decision that would impact her entire life when she was more mature and not have any regrets in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But based on his understanding of his daughter, if the Hunter family were to propose getting married immediately, he was afraid his naive daughter would agree right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "In any case, you are not allowed to get married until Tina graduates from college, and you are not allowed to do anything inappropriate to Tina. If Tina accidentally gets pregnant, don't blame me for getting angry," Hadwin said in a low voice, with a volume only the two of them could hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler uncomfortably pursed his lips, not daring to tell his future father-in-law that he had done something inappropriate just a few days ago...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But getting pregnant... he certainly wouldn't let Tina get pregnant now. After all, Tina is still young. Even if she gave birth to their child, which could save him, he would rather endure the pain and wait a few more years to have a child - if Tina still loved him and was willing to have a child together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After the two got in the car, Lina and Hadwin exchanged a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You say Tina won't cause any trouble this time, right?" Lina couldn't help but say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "She's only staying for a day, and even if there's any trouble, Chandler should be there to protect her," Hadwin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hopefully! Lina thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After the car arrived at the Hunter family mansion, Tina finally met her future in-laws and the elder Mr. Hunter, carrying bags and packages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Grandpa, Uncle, Aunt, hello!" Tina had a smile on her face as she greeted the Hunter family elders in a familiar manner, and then proceeded to display the gifts she had brought!</p></div>
