        <h1>Chapter 3309</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, you're only a month away from your due date now, right?" Camille said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, the baby should be born around early March," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Time flies so fast. It feels like just yesterday we were worrying about you getting pregnant," Camille said, as if her friend's pregnancy was still fresh in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, time really flies," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the chat, Brian returned to the villa. Upon seeing Camille, he greeted her and then bent down to naturally kiss Valda's forehead. "How was it? Did the baby give you a hard time today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was fine," Valda replied. "The fetal movements were normal too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you have any leg cramps?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I had one at noon," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian took off his coat, rolled up his sweater sleeves, and sat down next to Valda. "Was it the left leg?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it was."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian carefully placed Valda's left leg on his knee and used his slender fingers to give her leg a massage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How does it feel?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Be gentle...it's so sore," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How about now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Almost there, a little higher."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Uh-huh."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille, who was standing aside, was stunned. She never expected to witness the Crown Prince giving someone a massage in her lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is the aloof and cool male god in the eyes of others!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, what about being aloof now? Don't be too attentive to Valda!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Valda noticed her friend's shocked expression, she seemed to realize what was happening and blushed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, although Brian had given her massages many times before, Camille had never seen him do it until now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um... I'm in the late stage of pregnancy and my legs tend to cramp up, so when he has free time, he helps me massage them," explained Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's... It's pretty good," murmured Camille, "And Brian seems to have some good skills."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Craftsmanship?" Valda sweated profusely. "By the way, do you want to stay and have dinner with me?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I have a business meeting later. I'll come see you next time," Camille said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Camille left, Valda turned to Brian and said, "I feel like Camille was surprised when you helped me massage my calves. Does it not fit your image?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian chuckled. "Then what do you think fits my image?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"...It should be pure and aloof, high above everyone else," she said, which was her first impression of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's no longer the case," he said, looking deeply into her eyes. "When I fell in love with you, I was no longer like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda smiled. Yes, he was no longer like that now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she had felt he was like a distant moon that she could only look at from afar and not approach back then...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, there was a hint of fireworks in him. He was no longer out of reach, but within reach. He was gentle, passionate, and no longer cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, I like you more now," Valda said, raising her hands and holding Brian's face. "What should I do? I feel like painting you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My heart started racing, so my hands got itchy again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said, "I'm afraid tonight won't work. I still have some work to do for the company, so I'll probably be in the study tonight. How about tomorrow? I'll be your model then."</p></div>
