        <h1>Chapter 2725</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What would a man like him look like when he&rsquo;s madly in love with someone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How much... does he love Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Why are you staring at me?" His voice suddenly rang in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly came to her senses. "I'm just wondering... Uh... Do you not like purple?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glanced at her with a vague sense of pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly explained, "I bought a dress the last time we went shopping. Between purple and mint green, you picked mint green. And you picked pink this time. I have the feeling that you don't like purple very much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips were pressed together for a moment before saying, "I don't dislike purple. I just think... other colors suit you better than purple."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked. "I see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, you don't have to worry about anything at today's banquet. You just have to do what you normally do. But don't forget one thing," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is it?" she asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're my girlfriend, and you love me. You must never forget that." He reminded as his dark phoenix eyes stared intently at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could hardly take her eyes off his face for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gaze and voice kept reminding her that she was his girlfriend like some hypnosis!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tonight's banquet was a banquet for Emerald City's socialites. There would be no reporters around, so it was quite private.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Most of the attendees were Emerald City's socialites. Attending such banquets was a form of socializing. Of course, some popular celebrities in the film industry or leaders in other industries attended it too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As there were no reporters around, Valda Theller was relieved. After all, she did not want to be photographed by the reporters and have another viral post about her online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Remind me if anything I do later is inappropriate," Valda Theller whispered to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her wariness made him smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had brought a lot of women to banquets, but it was the first time he had ever met someone who looked so worried and nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His former girlfriends accompanied him to banquets more out of pride and ambition. They wanted to announce to everyone that they were his girlfriends and get more people to acknowledge that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the opposite. Her eyes did not have that ambition. Even though she looked at him with amazement and absentmindedness, she would quickly sober up each time. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she knew what she should and should not do. He need not worry at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not have much to worry about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian leaned down slightly and whispered in Valda Theller's ear, "Don't worry about that. Even if you do something inappropriate, it doesn't matter. You just have to love me until we leave the banquet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His soft voice was different from the usual indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's eyelashes trembled slightly as she looked up at the face so close in front of her. "Well... How can I show that I love you?" Were they going to hold hands at the banquet?</p></div>
