        <h1>Chapter 3977</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm...I'm sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop, I...I just happened to be passing by..." She explained weakly, her face pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick took a step forward and walked towards her. "Why do you keep appearing in front of </span><span>me?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" She was stunned, looking at him in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, I told you not to appear in front of me again, but why do you keep appearing in front of me?" Mick stood in front of her, speaking in an extremely cold tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at his dark peach blossom eyes, which were still as cold as they were in the VIP room just now, even with a hint of annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if he was extremely displeased with her appearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm...I'm sorry, I didn't know you were here! I won't do it again in the future..." She apologized, not knowing what else to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip tightly, then gathered all her courage and said, "I...I love you. I know you don't care about my feelings now, and I know that using you is a mistake that I can never make up for. I never intended to hurt you. At first, I thought it was just a transaction..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke intermittently, fueled by the alcohol. Without it, she might not have had the courage to say these things to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I did lie to you at first when I said I liked you. I just wanted a reason to get closer to you, to use you to avenge my mother. But...later on, I really did fall in love with you. When you came to the cemetery to find me, I was planning to tell you everything that day. But...I was too late. You already knew everything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze began to blur, her mind becoming muddled. She had so much more to say to him, but the alcohol was making it hard for her to remember what she wanted to say. Her tongue even began to tie itself in knots!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think saying 'I love you' can make up for everything?" Mick said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy shook her head, trying to clear her mind. "I...I don't want to make up for anything. I just wanted to tell you...I know you won't forgive me. I...I really want to apologize...I'm sorry...for hurting you. You...you're the best person in the world to me, besides my mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So the nicer he was to her, the more guilty she felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guilt was almost crushing her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mick...I'll disappear from your life, so you won't be bothered by me. I promise...this time...I can do it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice grew quieter towards the end, her body tilting to one side. Just as she was about to fall, he finally reached out and caught her, saving her from a painful fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick lowered his head and looked at Nancy in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, her eyes were closed, her cheeks flushed. She was completely drunk and had fallen asleep!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would she really disappear from his life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to see her again, so if she could really do what she promised, he should be happy, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then why did he feel like he couldn't catch his breath?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if something heavy was pressing down on his chest, making him feel especially uncomfortable!</span></p></div>
