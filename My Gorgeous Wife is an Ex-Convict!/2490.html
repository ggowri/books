        <h1>Chapter 2488</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you say George would help the Mitchell family? But he's not helping. He has done nothing!" Mr. Mitchell snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell said with a ghastly expression, "Amber Mitchell was the one who caused all this trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're useless. You failed to capture George Gregory's heart even after all these years," said Mr. Xia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's expression instantly became one of embarrassment. "My in-laws will come back with Simon in two days. Even if George Gregory doesn't intervene, I have ways to ask my in-laws to step in and help the Mitchell family. The Gregory family can't afford the embarrassment if I go to jail!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure they'll help?" Mrs. Mitchell asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know how much they dote on Simon. Besides, George Gregory doesn&rsquo;t have any mistresses. Simon is the only heir of the Gregory family!" Louise Mitchell said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Mitchell felt a little relieved when she said so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a servant suddenly hurried in. "Master, Madam, Miss, there are police officers outside saying they're here to take you to the station for questioning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Mitchell family was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A police officer came in and read out their names before they knew it. He then said, "We suspect that you three are involved in Amber Mitchell's case. Please come with us. Also, Miss Louise Mitchell is involved in causing intentional bodily injury to others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A police officer came up and handcuffed the three members of the Mitchell family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their expressions changed immediately. Mr. Mitchell shouted, "We'll cooperate with the police's investigation. But are you handcuffing us just because you think we're suspects? I want to see my lawyer! I'm going to sue the police."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can follow the normal procedures and get a lawyer, but you three are now suspects and need to be detained temporarily!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Mitchell and Mrs. Mitchell looked frightened as soon as they heard that. Louise Mitchell stared at the cold handcuffs on her wrists. What was happening was beyond her expectation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since the police were arresting them, they probably had substantial evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They could only count on the Gregory family now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I just have to delay things for a couple of days until my in-laws come back with Simon. Then, we can turn things around!' Louise Mitchell thought to herself before giving her parents a look, indicating them not to speak carelessly in the police station later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Mitchell and Mrs. Mitchell came to their senses and knew what to do when they saw the look in their daughter's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the three members of the Mitchell family were surrounded by reporters when the police led them out of their mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reporters rushed to the Mitchell family with questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without saying a word, the three got into the police car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost five minutes later, the first news about the three members of the Mitchell family getting into a police car went viral online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, more related news appeared online. They were surging in popularity. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked at the news about the arrest of three members of the Mitchell family on her phone. She looked at Grace. "Did you do this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled. "I just submitted the evidence I collected to the police, including the transaction records when they bribed the doctors and the doctors' oral statements."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The news said the police are investigating Louise Mitchell for causing intentional bodily injury to me. Did you submit the evidence for that too?" Amber Mitchell asked.</p></div>
