        <h1>Chapter 2753</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... But it might go viral if it gets on the news. Will our relationship be exposed?" she said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't want our relationship to be exposed to the public?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said awkwardly, "I just think it&rsquo;ll draw too much attention and..." She was silent for a moment before saying, "I have a dark history when I was in university. It&rsquo;ll be bad if people use it against you and cause you trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stopped and turned to look at the woman beside him. He thought she was afraid that the exposure would bring her trouble. He never thought it was him she was worried about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No matter what history you have back then, you don't have to be afraid of causing me any trouble. If we date on the premise of marriage, then our relationship will be exposed sooner or later. But I won't let my relationship go viral. I&rsquo;ll suppress the news about it when it happens. Don't worry," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one in the entertainment industry would go against the crown prince.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller only nodded without saying anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, does your so-called dark history refer to your relationship with Raymond Bowman in university?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She replied in a mutter, "Yeah. I got a bad reputation in university after that. Some people thought I tried every means to bother Raymond Bowman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's eyes dimmed as she recalled how strangers called her shameless whenever they saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her gloomy appearance made Brian feel uncomfortable. He liked to see her usual self, not dejected like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian suddenly said, "Do you want me to help you get justice? I can get Raymond Bowman to clarify the incident and tell everyone who misunderstood you the truth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked blankly at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you think it's impossible? Since I said so, I can do it," he said. It was because he wanted to get rid of the gloom in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, no. Of course, I know you can do it." Valda Theller bit her lip slightly and said, "But there&rsquo;s no need for it. Even if he makes it clear, people will only think Raymond Bowman was forced to say that because of you. People will only think what he said is false."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, she said, "As long as you don't think it&rsquo;ll affect you, then it doesn't matter to me. I&rsquo;m too old to care about it anyway. I've lost contact with my university classmates except for Camille now that it&rsquo;s been so many years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she faked a relaxed smile and said, "Alright, enough about that. There are a few stalls I often visit. Some of their knickknacks are pretty delicate. Accompany me to have a look."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes glimmered slightly before he said, "Okay, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller and Brian came to a stall with handmade dolls and accessories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller and the stall owner were obviously familiar with each other as they greeted each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, didn't you say you could custom-make dolls last time?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, how would you like it?" the stall owner asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "Please hand me a paper and pen. I'll draw it for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The stall owner replied and handed over a paper and pen. Valda Theller quickly drew on the white paper.</p></div>
