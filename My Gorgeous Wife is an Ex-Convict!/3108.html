        <h1>Chapter 3106</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She is really afraid that something might happen to Jasmine, and that his self-blame will continue for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, what is he blaming himself for? Is it... because of her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't blame yourself, Brian... I'm... I'm fine," Valda tried to force a smile to prove that she was really okay, but her ankle hurt so much that she couldn't even manage a forced smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who are you? Are you causing trouble by filming? Security, get security over here!" The assistant who was just kicked over by Brian has now gotten up from the ground and is shouting for security.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian bent down and picked up Valda, his gaze icy as he looked at the assistant. "Did you hurt her like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what if she tried to stop the filming? I did it this way..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The assistant hadn't finished speaking when Brian kicked him to the ground. Before he could get up, Brian's foot was already pressing down on his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked down at the security guard with a cold, icy stare and said, "You deserve to die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He spoke and increased the force on his feet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The assistant was screaming in pain, and at this moment, the security guards had already surrounded them. The assistant director of the crew also ran over with the security guards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The assistant quickly said, "Quickly, this person is obstructing the filming and even intentionally hurting people. I need to call the police and sue him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few security guards were about to approach Brian when the assistant director suddenly exclaimed upon seeing someone, "Too...too young master?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Prince?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone was stunned for a moment!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, the assistant director quickly scolded the security guards, saying "Don't mess around, this person is the CEO of Hart Group!" He is also a prince in the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If we really offend the Crown Prince, we can forget about filming this play!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several security guards quickly pushed him down, while the assistant who was trampled on felt a sharp pain in his chest and looked stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did the prince come here? And what is the relationship between the prince and this woman who won't leave?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The prince, this...this is a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding!" The assistant director repeatedly apologized to Brian with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A misunderstanding?" Brian's eyes turned cold. "Valda was treated like this by your crew. I won't let this go so easily!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The assistant director immediately broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And this person..." Brian's gaze turned to the assistant. "No one can protect her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, he looked down at Valda, who was pale in his arms, and quickly left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The top priority was to quickly find a doctor to check Valda's condition. He would not leave without doing so!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian passed by the restaurant holding Valda, Camille happened to see him and hurriedly ran out to catch up with him. "What's wrong? What happened to Valda?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She seems to have a leg pain. I'm taking her to the hospital now," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I'll go with you," Camille quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda is in pain right now, her face has turned pale and she's sweating profusely on her forehead. She struggles to say, "I'm sorry, we were supposed to have dinner together, but I messed things up like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you talking about? If I had known, I would have gone to the restroom with you," said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not your concern, I didn't handle it well myself..." Valda said, her eyes involuntarily glancing at Brian who was holding her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The self-blame on his face... is still so evident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew how much she didn't want to see his self-blame!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Right now, her ankle hurts too much and the pain has spread to her calf. She didn't say much because speaking only intensifies the pain for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda didn't want Camille and Brian to see her pain, so she buried her face as much as possible into Brian's embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her trembling body betrayed her pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian tightened his thin lips and quickened his pace.</p></div>
