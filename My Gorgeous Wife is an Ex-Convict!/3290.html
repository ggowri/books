        <h1>Chapter 3288</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, that's great!" Kering quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked around and saw that there were too many people, so he said, "Let's go back. It's not safe here with so many people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm," Valda responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The driver had already pulled the car up to the side of the street, while the bodyguard cleared the crowd. Only then did Valda and Brian get into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though they got on the car, people kept taking pictures from behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After filming the scene where Valda and Brian left, the production team temporarily stopped shooting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The staff looked at Kering with envy as this rising star unexpectedly met the prince and princess. If he's lucky, he might climb a few more steps in this industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the car, Valda exclaimed, "I didn't expect it to be Kering. Too bad Lina isn't here, she seems to be quite interested in Kering."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So Hadwin is probably just glad that Lina isn't here," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda couldn't help but laugh when she heard it. It does seem that way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you planning to take Lina with you to the premiere of that person's movie?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not just Lina, but also Grace, Camille, Kyla, and Amber," Valda counted on her fingers while asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian watched as Valda counted on her fingers and mentioned so many names, but she didn't mention his name at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you not taking me with you?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" Valda blinked in surprise and looked at the other person. "You're going too? But I thought you weren't interested in art films."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the movie that Kering is going to release this time is an art film.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shouldn't a husband accompany his wife to watch a movie? Or is it that you prefer your friends to accompany you instead of your husband?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Right now, his face is very close to hers, and his warm breath is spraying on her ear, making her feel a tingling sensation in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where...where is it?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, then on that day, I'll accompany you as well," he concluded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Valda let out a cry of "Ah!" Brian immediately became nervous and asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Babe...the baby is kicking me," said Valda. She is now 6 months pregnant and can clearly feel the fetal movements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian lifted his hand and placed his palm on Valda's belly, feeling the movements of the baby inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems like a lively child," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This statement is not wrong. Since Valda felt the fetal movement, she has been able to feel it several times a day, indicating that the baby is quite active.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you misbehave when you were a child?" Valda asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Before the age of three, I don't remember anything. You'll have to ask my parents about that. But since I have memories after the age of three, I don't think I was mischievous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She guessed that his "not mischievous" meant that she was actually very mischievous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I wonder whose personality this child will have in the future," Valda muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hopefully like you," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, it would be best to have a mini Valda. It would feel great.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda thought about herself. Before her parents passed away, she was quite mischievous and was scolded by her parents often, or had to eat bamboo shoots and shredded pork.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But later, her parents' sudden death made her grow up overnight. She was no longer mischievous, but more silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, if possible, it would be very happy to continue being mischievous under the care of her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then the child will look like you and have my personality, how about that?" Valda said, thinking for a moment before adding, "Of course, the intelligence should be like yours too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was a top student. If the child had his intelligence, it would be as easy as eating cabbage to study in the future. How great!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian smiled and said, "Okay, whatever you say."</p></div>
