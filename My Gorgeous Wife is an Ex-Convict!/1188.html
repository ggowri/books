        <h1>Chapter 1187</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Bryn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she did not think that she would fall in love with anyone again, could she be indifferent to his feelings?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace was lost in her thoughts, her phone rang. Grace looked at the caller ID, and it was Brian's name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed the answer button, and Brian's clear yet somewhat gorgeous voice sounded through her phone. "Sorry to call you so late."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright. I'm still up. What's the matter?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just... suddenly wanted to hear your voice," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned. She did not know how to speak when he put it like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He hesitated and said, "Grace, if... If you like Transformers toys, I can buy you any previous models." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I actually... Uh, I liked them when I was little, but I&rsquo;ve grown out of it now," she said immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" His voice paused. "I don't know how to please a woman." After all, it was always the other women who were trying to please him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as he gave those women some money or film resources, those women would give an ecstatic look and keep fawning over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he turned around one day, he realized it was actually difficult to please someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you tell me how to please you? I&rsquo;ll do anything you want." Brian's voice was tinged with anticipation and longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent for a long moment before saying, "You... don't have to do that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just want to be nice to you and give you everything I can. Grace, is there another man you care about?" said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. Somehow, Jason's cold face flashed through her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If there's no such person in your heart right now, then promise me that you'll consider me when you want to care about a man and fall in love with someone one day." Brian's voice flooded into Grace's ears word by word through the phone, just like stones constantly crashing into her calm heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can I ever fall in love again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stayed up all night thinking about what Brian said. At noon, Chase Harper drove to the firm and took her to the hospital to accompany Nelson to discharge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn and Kyla Corbyn were also in the ward, waiting for the doctor's discharge summary report.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I have to go to the nurse's desk and print out Nelson's check-up reports for these days and keep a copy." Kyla Corbyn was suddenly reminded of it and was about to get up when Chase Harper spoke.</p></div>
