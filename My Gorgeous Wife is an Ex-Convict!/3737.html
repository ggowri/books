        <div><span>.</span><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you go back to the restaurant?" she asked, glancing around and breathing a sigh of relief when she didn't see Daniel's figure. He must have left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was waiting for you to come with me. Are you looking for Daniel?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah? No, no!" She quickly waved her hand and took his hand, saying, "Let's go back to the restaurant. Maybe the food is already served."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they returned to the restaurant, some of the dishes were already on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they ate, Veronica couldn't help but ask, "I went to the bathroom later. You and Mr. Cross...nothing happened, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think would happen?" he asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." She thought to herself that nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you care about Daniel?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," she denied. "I just don't want to have anything to do with him anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, their separation from Daniel was a bit of a painful memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to have anything to do with him, then you won't," he said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His resolute voice made her body tremble suddenly, as if as long as he said it, it would definitely come true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't hurt him!" she said. Although it was Daniel's father who embezzled public funds, Mason had taken advantage of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It can only be said that everyone was at fault for what happened back then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you worried about him? Afraid I'll hurt him?" His voice lowered a few degrees, filled with a cold feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not worried about him, I just don't want him to experience anything bad because of me and feel guilty about it," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to involve Daniel in the situation between her and Mason. To her, Daniel was "just an insignificant person."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words seemed to please him, as the low pressure around him slowly dissipated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just as Veronica was about to breathe a sigh of relief, Mason's next question made her hold her breath again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daniel said today was only the second time you've met. Have you met him before?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Veronica felt embarrassed, she still told Mason about her previous encounter with Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was just a chance encounter," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really have no feelings for him anymore?" he asked, staring at her as if scrutinizing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I don't," she replied, meeting his gaze without any evasion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then do you have feelings for anyone else now?" he asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned red involuntarily. My god, how could he ask such a question? Besides him, who else could she have feelings for now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He calmly waited for her answer, while she had an urge to vomit blood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't you tell me?" he said, his voice somehow carrying a dangerous feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, she didn't want any more misunderstandings between them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica quickly said, "No, I can tell you. I have feelings for you now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned red as she blurted out the words in one breath. After finishing, she realized that people at nearby tables were looking at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned even redder!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh my god, she must have spoken too loudly. Everyone at the nearby tables probably heard her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly lowered her head and buried herself in her food, trying to ignore the stares from those around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? That's great," his voice sounded low.</span></p></div>
