        <h1>Chapter 1096</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... seem to have no energy," he said, wanting to catch the bowl again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at his current state and simply said, "Forget it. Let me feed you in case you have no energy and knock the bowl over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sat down on a chair by the bed as she spoke and scooped up some porridge with the spoon. She gently blew on it and held it to his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He opened his mouth obediently and ate the porridge she fed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was as docile as a puppy, eating porridge mouthful after mouthful, but his eyes had been staring at her intensely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That look of attachment made her a little uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did that woman... you talked about last time kill someone in Splashes of Blood?" She tried to make conversation and break the silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's true," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She killed someone from the Reed family, didn't she? Did the Reed family just let her go?" she asked in confusion. The Reed family was also rich and powerful more than 70 years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "Because the man she killed wanted to let her go. He even left a note before he died. It was no one's business if he died!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. 'Did the man expect the woman to kill him? Was that why he left a note like that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was a time of chaos back then. The law was not as strict as it was now. If the Reed family did not pursue the matter, the woman could indeed escape from being imprisoned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened to the woman afterward?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow, she wanted to know the woman's final fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She returned here. The room you slept in was her bedroom. She stayed here until she died," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Until she died? Alone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said lightly, "You could say there were two people, perhaps. She returned here pregnant and gave birth to a boy who later became the heir to the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. She did not expect the story to end up like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman... who killed the man she fell in love with became pregnant with the man's child. She chose to return here and give birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This feud was simply more tortuous than those TV series&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Wait a minute!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly widened her eyes and seemed to look at Jason in disbelief. 'If I calculate the time, does that mean&hellip;' "The boy who was born is your... grandfather?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He nodded and said, "Yes. It's the Reed family's secret, and I only found out a few years ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately felt awkward. 'Is it alright for him to confide in me like this?' However, she never expected to have met someone involved in the story he told her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Until now, she still remembered when she met Old Master Reed. It had not been a good experience. Old Master Reed's cold and inhuman ruthlessness made her shudder with fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had not arrived in time back then, Old Master Reed might have disfigured her.</p></div>
