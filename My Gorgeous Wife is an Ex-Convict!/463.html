        <h1>Chapter 462</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold's eyes flickered. "It&rsquo;ll be easy to make someone like her go to prison again. I'll give the orders later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He made light of the matter as if such manipulation of other people's destinies was a perfectly normal thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a twinkle in her eyes and gnashing of her teeth, Camelia Meyer said, "Then give her a life sentence this time. I want her to stay in there for the rest of her life!" It was the only way to get rid of her hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, I'll do as you please. Don't think too much about Jennifer and hurt yourself. Think about Lily," said Harold</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, Lily is our only daughter now. Who else will I think about?" said Camelia Meyer. "It's just a pity that the man she likes is the Stevens&rsquo;s boy. If it's Jason, we might still be his in-laws!" Camelia Meyer seemed to say this with some reluctance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We can't be that fortunate all the time. At least... Lily is getting what she wants now," said Harold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you must make me get my wish soon too. I must see Grace go to prison again!" Camelia Meyer had not forgotten about Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, I'll hurry!" answered Harold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? You met Grace at the mall?" When Lily went home to visit her parents, she never expected to hear about this from her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, she just happened to shop in our mall. I wanted to buy something and asked your father to accompany me. I didn't expect to see the woman. She has no guilt at all and even has the cheek to shop in our mall, so I embarrassed her severely," said Camelia Meyer with some triumphant relief in her tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lily's face grew paler as she listened. "How did you... embarrass her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I slapped her, of course. Then, your dad got security to kick her out of the mall." Camelia Meyer had not noticed anything wrong with her daughter's expression and was still talking about what happened. She detailed the embarrassment and humiliation that Grace suffered when she was thrown out of the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily got more and more frightened as she listened! She was beginning to regret not telling her parents about Grace and Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had thought Jason was just fooling around with Grace and that Grace would soon be dumped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she found out later that Jason and Grace&rsquo;s relationship was not as casual as she thought. Jason had even gone up against Brian for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was not what she expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, Brian and Jason were close. The Hart family and Reed family also had some business dealings with each other. Even so, Jason dared to humiliate Brian's new girlfriend in front of everyone when they were at the set. He did it right in front of Brian too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she consciously avoided Grace. It was just that she did not realize her parents would do this to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought of Sean's sister, Zoe, who had humiliated Grace and was still limping on one leg.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, call... Call Dad to find out Grace&rsquo;s whereabouts and apologize to her in person!" Perhaps the Atkinson family could dodge the bullet this way.</p></div>
