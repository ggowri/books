        <h1>Chapter 3381</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How long have I been sleeping?" Lornell asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Young master was rescued six hours after the explosion and has been unconscious for a day," the subordinate replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then..." He hesitated for a moment, but couldn't help asking, "What about the little girl who was rescued with me? How is she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley was lying on top of him at the time, so she should have been rescued with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Young master is referring to Miss Hart from the Hart family, right?" the subordinate asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Hart was sent to the hospital by the Hart family when she was rescued. I don't know any other details," the subordinate said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell breathed a sigh of relief. Since she was rescued and sent to the hospital by the Hart family, she should be okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could visit her after he was discharged from the hospital, and if she still wanted to know his name, he could tell her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, what Lornell didn't know was that Harley was currently lying in the ICU with a tube in her nose, unconscious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda and Brian stood outside the IUC ward, separated by a transparent glass wall. Apart from anxiety, worry, and pain, there seemed to be no other expression on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since the incident, Valda has been crying constantly. When the explosion occurred, both she and Brian were relatively lucky. Although they were affected by the blast, they only suffered minor injuries and were not seriously hurt. However, their daughter was directly buried by the building in the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, she was almost in despair and ran towards her daughter's location, hoping to find her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... there are so many stones and pillars that she doesn't even know about, and they cannot be moved by human strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's possible that incorrect handling could actually cause harm to the person trapped inside!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, every minute and every second was a torment for her. Time passed slowly, making each day feel like a year. That's just how it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, it was the vague humming of a tune by their daughter that led them to find her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I thought that although my daughter had bled a little, her external injuries didn't seem serious, so maybe the situation was still okay. But now, the child is in a coma, and the doctor said that if she doesn't wake up within 72 hours, the situation will become dangerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's all my fault, it's all because of me. I shouldn't have agreed to let Harley go to the amusement park!" Valda blamed herself, tears streaming down her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not your fault, Valda. Nobody could have predicted something like this," Brian comforted. "If you insist on blaming yourself, then isn't it my fault even more? I promised to protect you and Harley, but I didn't do a good job of it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at her husband with teary eyes and asked, "Brian, can Harley wake up? If she doesn't wake up within 72 hours, what will happen to her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't bring herself to say the words "vegetative state" out loud, afraid that by doing so, it would become a reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't even imagine what would happen if Harley, who was so lively, could never open her eyes again, never call out for her mother, and could only lie in bed like this forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, she is our child. Even if she doesn't wake up within 72 hours, I will definitely find the best doctor to treat her," Brian reassured Valda as he hugged her.</p></div>
