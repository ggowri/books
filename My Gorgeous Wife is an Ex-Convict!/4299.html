        <h1>Chapter 4297 Purpose</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina remained silent. After bidding farewell to Eugenia, she returned to her car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Deception... Chandler did deceive her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ultimately, he didn't harm her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps from the beginning, his deception was to gain her favor so that he could marry her more smoothly in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in this process, she only accepted his efforts without having to give anything in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the videos and photos she had seen from the past also showed how good he was to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could this kind of deception really not be forgiven...?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Eugenia said that, Tina already had an answer in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At night, Tina entered the nursery. The nanny in the room respectfully approached her when she saw Tina enter and said, "Miss Stephenson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is Quinn?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn is very well-behaved. She just finished feeding and fell asleep not long ago," the nanny replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina approached the edge of the crib, bending down to look at the peacefully sleeping little one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This little child had suffered more hardships than other children in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Quinn's features resembled both her and Chandler. Looking at Quinn, she would think of </span><span>Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was her mindset when she insisted on marrying Chandler before even graduating from college? And why did she become pregnant with Quinn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it a moment of loss of control? An accidental pregnancy? Or was it intentional?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it to help Chandler break the curse as soon as possible, so she became pregnant with Quinn?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No one could tell her the answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina sat down on the chair beside the crib, silently watching her daughter, determined in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, when Chandler was about to finish work, his secretary suddenly called on the internal line. "Mr. Hunter, Miss Stephenson is here and wants to see you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler paused for a moment, didn't she just come yesterday?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let her in," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," the secretary responded, ending the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moments later, Tina pushed open the office door and walked in alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here?" Chandler asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll be off work soon, let's have dinner together," Tina suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler frowned slightly, "Why would we have dinner together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't a husband and wife have dinner together?" she retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We've already signed the divorce agreement," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But we're not officially divorced yet."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina..." he couldn't help but sigh, getting up and walking towards her, "What do you really want? Just say it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to go to the restaurant I used to like, have the food I used to enjoy. I want to know if I still like it now!" Tina said, "Yesterday I ran into Eugenia, she said I used to love a certain drink. I ordered that drink yesterday, and it was still delicious."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she took a step closer to him, getting even closer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler, you probably know the old me better than anyone else, you probably know some of my preferences better than my own parents. </span><span>So</span><span> it shouldn't be difficult for you to find a restaurant I like and order some of the food I used to enjoy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pursed his lips, "Is that all?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," she nodded. Of course, that was just one purpose. There was another...</span></p></div>
