        <h1>Chapter 4324 Recruitment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler stared at Tina for a while before saying, "Okay, but we only have one glass of wine. After drinking this one, don't drink anymore. It's not good for your health."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, "Tina responded cheerfully," how about we just drink this cup in one gulp."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, she just drugged herself in this glass of wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina held up her glass and touched it with Chandler, then drank the wine in the glass. However, her gaze fell on the glass in Chandler's hand, and it wasn't until she watched Chandler finish that glass that she breathed a sigh of relief in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Lornell doesn't give her any fake medicine, then the medicine she added to the wine just now should be enough to make things happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But later, after they finished their meal together, Tina looked at Chandler with a calm expression, as if she had not been affected by any medication.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is the medicine ineffective?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina couldn't help but think.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dinner has already been eaten, I'll have someone take you back, "Chandler suddenly stood up and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to stay a little longer until I finish eating. You don't need to rush me away so quickly, "Tina whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler didn't pay attention to her, just took out his phone and wanted to make a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you calling? "Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call the driver, "Chandler said with his back to Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need! "Tina approached to stop him from making the phone call, but after touching his hand, she felt a burning sensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with you? Your hands are so hot! "She exclaimed in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the next moment, he had already shaken off her hand and said, "Don't touch me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voice carried a suppressed moan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was momentarily taken aback, then approached Chandler even closer and walked directly to his face, looking at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Chandler's face turned crimson, and a thin layer of sweat seeped from his forehead. His expression, which had always been calm and composed, was now desperately suppressing something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this medicine working?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was secretly thinking about this issue, and Chandler's voice had already sounded again: "Tina... you can find the driver to take you back. I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable, sorry, I'll go back to my room first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he felt as if his body was about to explode, and his sanity seemed to be about to lose at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He can't stay with Tina anymore.He must go back to his room immediately and lock himself up to stop this impulse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did the insect attack?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the feeling that is spreading in my body now, although, with some faint pain, the uncontrollable desire is even stronger than usual!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler walked quickly and stumbled to his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he entered the room and was about to close the door, a body squeezed into the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina? "Chandler stared at her with red eyes and gasped for breath," Didn't I ask you to go back?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I go back on my own now that you're like this? "Tina said," Are you feeling bad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all the rationality in his mind was fading. Looking at the person in front of him, his mind was filled with only one thought, which was to forcefully crush her under his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler! "At the moment Tina's hand touched Chandler's cheek, the desire he had been desperately suppressing suddenly felt like a volcanic eruption.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, she was already thrown into bed by him!</span></p></div>
