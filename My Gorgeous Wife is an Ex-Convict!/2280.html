        <h1>Chapter 2278</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, a person who once helped her had now become someone who had hurt her. Such a transformation could make one emotional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn would visit her daughter every day after Nelson finished school, bringing her food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss could only eat liquid food these days because of the wounds on his neck. The hospital would prepare his meals for him, so Mrs. Corbyn did not have to prepare additional food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the third day, when Martin Weiss could get out of bed and walk, he often went to Kyla's ward to watch her eat. He communicated with her in sign language.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla knew sign language because of Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although her son now had a cochlear implant and could communicate freely under most circumstances, Kyla had not forgotten sign language.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect Martin Weiss to know sign language either. He was quite fluent too. At least, they had no problem communicating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He... probably learned sign language because of Nelson,' Kyla thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had done a lot over the years, but... she had no idea since he never told her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like how he learned sign language for Nelson and how he secretly stored blood in the hospital for her labor...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching Martin Weiss gesturing with sigh language, Kyla fell into a trance. The man seemed to start holding more importance in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she had forgotten him over the years, but it turned out that making someone important to you again was such a quick process. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss raised his hand and waved it in front of her eyes, then asked through sign language, &lsquo;What's on your mind?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla instantly came back to her senses. &ldquo;N-Nothing. I&rsquo;m just thinking of my discharge tomorrow. Did the doctor say how many more days you have to stay in the hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He signed the words, &lsquo;A week. I can be discharged if I get better after a week.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'One more week...' She looked at the bandages that were still on his neck and hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suffered all these injuries because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want to eat when you&rsquo;re discharged? Why don't I make it and bring it to you? Did the doctor say when you can start eating normally?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He replied in sign language, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m guessing tomorrow.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for keeping the baby and me safe this time," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he seemed guilty after she said this. After a few moments of silence, he raised his hand again and gestured to say, &lsquo;I didn't do a good job at protecting you. I should have known that Mr. Lambert wasn&rsquo;t a good person. I should&rsquo;ve expected him to do something.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps all this could have been avoided if he had been more careful and sent someone to protect her in secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, someone was shouting outside the ward, "Let me in. Let me see Mrs. Weiss! I want to speak to her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sir, please leave. The patient needs to rest. Please follow the normal registration process if you want to see the patient! We'll let you in if the patient agrees to see you." The nurse's voice rang out afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to go in. Let me in! Mrs. Weiss, I'm Neal Reid. I want to see you!" The man's voice grew louder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. She remembered that Neal Reid was the man who was with Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned and gestured to Kyla in sign language, &lsquo;I'll have someone make him leave.&rsquo;</p></div>
