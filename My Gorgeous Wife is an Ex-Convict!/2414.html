        <h1>Chapter 2412</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, Jasper had brought a lot of colorful papers that she thought were beautiful. She planned to fold a lot of beautiful paper frogs with William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mick Reed watched the scene with boredom. He could not figure out why folding a couple of paper frogs was so fun, but seemed to want to fold hundreds or even thousands of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What confused him more was that William folded the paper frogs with keen interest. It was as if it was a happy thing to be able to fold paper frogs with Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Happy?' Mick Reed thought putting together puzzles was more interesting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone in the Barlow family watched the two little ones fold paper frogs with great interest. Old Madam Shen, in particular, had her eyes fixed on her grandson and the Reed family's daughter. They were adorable, sitting at the coffee table with their little heads huddled together. They looked like a perfect match.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, in Old Madam Shen's opinion, the Barlow and Reed families were an equal match. Therefore, it would not be a bad idea if her grandson ended up the Reed family's daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The old madam looked at Jasper as though she was looking at her future granddaughter-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace and Jason reached the Barlow family&rsquo;s house, there was already a pile of paper frogs in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, look. William and I have folded so many paper frogs. I'm going to teach William how to fold stars later. Then, we can put the frogs and the stars into a glass bottle. It&rsquo;ll be beautiful," Jasper said excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's getting late now, so why don't we go back to the hotel and come back tomorrow to see William?" Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jasper heard they were going back, her expression sank. "Can't I play with William for a little longer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was about to speak when Philip Barlow said first, "Why don't you guys stay and have dinner with us tonight? Let me be the host since you're in my city."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Jasper immediately nodded her small head, pulled at Grace's sleeve, and said, "Mommy, why don't we have dinner here? Otherwise, Uncle Barlow will be sad if he can't... uh... host."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace almost laughed at her daughter's words, while Philip Barlow also had a wry smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the Reed family stayed for dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper happily sat with William, but she was as natural as a little host. She helped William with the food while she chattered, "William, you seem to have lost weight. You need to eat more. You're cuter when you're chubby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William obediently ate the food that Jasper gave him. He ate with all his might. 'I'm cuter if I'm chubby? Will she like me more if I'm chubbier?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Barlow and Old Madam Barlow were delighted to see their grandson eat more than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their grandson usually ate so little. They were even worried that their grandson would not get enough nutrients!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mick Reed blinked and watched his sister have dinner with William, wondering why William was so obedient to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William was no longer the poor little boy dependent on others. He did not need to do this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After dinner, Jasper and William sat down at the piano in the living room and began to play a tune.</p></div>
