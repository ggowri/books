        <h1>Chapter 3197</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time passes day by day, and their agreed wedding date is getting closer and closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These days, every rehabilitation session for Valda is not easy and she has to endure the pain. However, every time, Brian takes the time to accompany her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had also told him before, "You don't have to come and accompany me during my rehabilitation. There's nothing for you to do here, you can only wait outside and be bored, isn't that very dull?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he said, "I don't find it boring. For me, I can't understand or endure your pain, but at least I can be with you when you're in pain. Valda, this is not a boring thing for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, do you plan on staying with me until the wedding?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I will also be with you all the time after the wedding," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was his lifelong promise! His companionship was not just about accompanying her during rehabilitation, but also about being with her for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's wedding has naturally attracted a lot of attention, with some even betting that he might call it off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, until one week before the wedding, there was no news of calling off the wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Three days before the wedding, Brian accompanied Valda to visit her parents' graves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is not the first time he has accompanied her here, but it is the most formal one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, he was dressed in a black suit with a black bow tie and a white shirt underneath, looking just like he did on his wedding day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda stood in front of a grave wearing the wedding dress she was going to wear at her wedding in three days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In three days, she is getting married, so she wants her parents to see what she looks like on her wedding day. Initially, she only planned to wear her wedding dress, but after he found out about her idea, he also dressed up in a suit that one would wear on their wedding day and went with her to visit her parents' graves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, thank you," Valda sincerely said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What is there to be thankful for? It's only natural for them to see what we looked like when we got married, isn't it?" said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda smiled and said, "If my parents knew I had found such a wonderful husband, they would be happy for me! I think they are watching us from the afterlife and smiling at us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian held Valda's hand and said to the tombstone, "Mom, Dad, don't worry. I will take good care of Valda, love her, protect her, and give her everything I have."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was taken aback when he referred to her parents... "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They are your parents, and now that you are going to be my wife, it's only natural for me to call them mom and dad, right?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's eyes became slightly moist, but a smile appeared on her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's light the incense first," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them personally lit the prepared incense and candles for the offering, and then Valda placed the food she had made herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The breeze in the cemetery gently brushed against Valda's body. She looked at the photos of her parents on the tombstone, and her eyes gradually became moist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I wish my parents were still alive, and I wish they could attend her wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, in life, there are always too many regrets that cannot be perfect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps this is what life is all about, and what makes it more precious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the candle was about to burn out, Valda spoke to the gravestone, "Mom and Dad, I am very happy now. Brian is really good to me. Every year from now on, he and I will come to visit you. In the future, we will also bring our children to visit you together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wind blew through the leaves, making a rustling sound, as if responding to her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda knelt in front of the tombstone, wanting to pay her respects to her parents in a solemn manner. However, what she didn't expect was for Brian to also kneel down beside her.</p></div>
