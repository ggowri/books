        <h1>Chapter 2684</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman watched Raymond Bowman run away and pressed her red lips tightly. 'He left in such a hurry. Is he worried about Valda Theller?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's a pity that Valda Theller was saved today. Valda Theller got lucky. I didn't expect Hart Group's executive assistant to show up because of a filming strike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But... what on earth is going on? Why would an executive assistant of a corporation care if the actors of a film went on strike?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman's doubts were shared by many of the cast members. Only Gloria looked enlightened as if he had confirmed something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Sure enough... The company asked me to join the cast and become the male lead because of Valda Theller!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brother Stephenson, why are you smiling?" Gloria's assistant beside Gloria could not help asking when they saw the smile on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gloria said with a half-smile, "There are always people who bite off more than they can chew. They think they're stones and want to break eggs, but it turns out they're the eggs that people can break easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The assistant scratched their head, confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anyway, be polite to Valda Theller in the future. Don't offend her," said Gloria.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman drove toward Third Hospital. On the way, he kept thinking about what had happened today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was both regretful yet grateful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He regretted looking on again when Valda needed help. He... thought it was just acting and did not expect Valda to get hurt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Barbara Schuman said Queenie Mack's backer was the Weiss family of Emerald City, he did hesitate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had worked so hard to get to where he was now. If he offended the Weiss family of Emerald City because of this, his efforts these years would have been in vain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he hesitated at the time. He hesitated about whether Valda Theller was worth it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was glad that the woman called Estelle Rowe saved Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why would Hart Group's executive assistant... help Valda Theller?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Estelle Rowe's speech sounded like she was accusing the actors of going on strike, but this film has nothing much to do with Hart Group. Why would Hart Group ask their executive assistant to go over?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Raymond Bowman's phone rang, and he answered it. "It&rsquo;s Raymond Bowman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Bowman, I've identified the person you asked me to look up for you. He's..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After they said a name and a title, Raymond Bowman's pupils constricted immediately. "What? Is it really him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'll send you the information later. Of course, it's easy to find his information if you search online. But the one I'm giving you might be more detailed," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it! Email me everything you have on him," said Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shortly afterward, his phone rang, notifying him that he had received a new email. Raymond Bowman turned the steering wheel and stopped at the roadside. He opened his email on his phone and looked at the information he had gotten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The photo he saw made his heart sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's... really him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian, president of Hart Group, the crown prince of the entertainment industry, and also... Valda's new boyfriend!'</p></div>
