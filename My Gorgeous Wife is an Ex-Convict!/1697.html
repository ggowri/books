        <h1>Chapter 1695</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace retorted to Irene Lynch, "You're the one who did this to yourself! The Reed family helped you and your daughter when you were at your worst. They gave you the life you never had. You could have lived a luxurious and peaceful life with your daughter but you ruined it yourself. Your greed ruined you. The Reed family owes you nothing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, Grace took Jason's hand. "Jay, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," he replied. He only had eyes for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was still cursing, but no one responded!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Let's go!" the policewoman scolded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch knew she would probably be spending the rest of her life in jail!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace and Jason came out of the police station's side door. Although some reporters were waiting there, the bodyguards Jason arranged had blocked them off, so they quickly got in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After they got in, Grace still held Jason's hand tightly. She was giving him her warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason glanced down at their clasped hands. "Do you really think I did nothing wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Huh?" She paused before immediately realizing that he was probably referring to what she just said to Irene Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Irene Lynch is too greedy. Sometimes, greed isn't a bad thing and can motivate you, but you shouldn't hurt others no matter what!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sounding a little regretful, Grace said, "But her daughter... is in trouble. Irene Lynch will probably get a heavy sentence. She&rsquo;ll spend at least ten years in prison, and Oriel Lynch saw her mother get taken away by the police. It's related to the Reed family and me. Later on..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said lightly, "The Reed family will cancel her adoption, so you don't have to worry about how to get along with her in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Cancel?" Grace was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason seemed to say matter-of-factly, "Am I supposed to adopt the daughter of a woman who hurt my wife?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "But you adopted her, and Oriel is just a five-year-old girl. In this situation where many people witnessed the scene and it was also live-streamed, I'm afraid it&rsquo;ll affect her mental state."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The child would probably be pointed at and criticized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps the only way to handle this was to let the child have a change of environment and have a psychologist counsel her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You can do whatever you want," said Jason. He did not care about Oriel Lynch. "But I want Irene Lynch to spend the rest of her life in jail!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace did not have any sympathy for Irene Lynch's future in jail. After all, if Jay had not caught her in time, she would have fallen from the fifth floor. Even if she survived, she would end up a cripple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She just felt sorry for Oriel Lynch, who lost her mother's love and company at such a young age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, even if someone tries to hurt me, I don't want you to get your hands dirty like that again," she said.</p></div>
