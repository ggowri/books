        <h1>Chapter 1881</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&rsquo;Is he... really walking away?' Grace was shocked. Then, his men removed the barricades that were in place and the road to L City was unimpeded once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her eyes were full of disbelief as she slowly turned to look at Jason, who was standing on one side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His face was expressionless. Even the eyes that were looking at her seemed to hold no emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace felt a pang in her heart and mouthed silently, &lsquo;Jay, I'm sorry!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her foot stepped on the gas pedal, and the car shot out onto the freeway!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason looked at the leaving car coldly. After a long time, he slowly raised his hand and placed it on his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It... hurts so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Is this how it feels like to be betrayed by the person you love the most?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Mother betrayed Father once, and now Grace... has betrayed me too!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace drove to L City numbly, but she kept recalling the way Jay had looked at her. It was as if she had hurt him terribly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Jay, just this once! Just this once, okay?' she shouted to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car finally pulled up to L City's First Hospital. Grace realized her face was covered in tears again somehow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Wiping away her tears with all her might, she helped Mrs. Watts into the hospital's emergency room with Old Lawyer Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctor gave Mrs. Watts a preliminary diagnosis. While waiting for the blood test report, Old Lawyer Watts told Grace, "Grace, thank you for this, but you and Jason..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mentor, don't worry about me. I... I'll go back and explain it to Jay. I'll ask him for forgiveness." She comforted Old Lawyer Watts but felt uneasy herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Will Jay ever forgive me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It's not like he didn't give me a chance. He even said at the freeway that if I went home with him, he could forget it ever happened, but I still...' Grace's drooping hands tugged at the hem of her dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If he doesn&rsquo;t forgive me...' The thought made her ache all over even though it just crossed her mind. She did not want to think about it anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After the blood test report and other examination reports came out, sure enough, Mrs. Watts's fever was serious. If she had come to the hospital a few days later, she might have suffered from organ failure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctor also chided Old Lawyer Watts and Grace for sending the patient over so late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After going through the paperwork for Mrs. Watts's hospital admittance and sending Mrs. Watts into the ward, Old Lawyer Watts looked at Grace's exhausted face. He said, "Why don't you take a rest and get a good night's sleep?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "No, I have to go back to Emerald City. I want to get back to Jay as soon as possible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts tried to persuade her again, but he sighed when he saw his apprentice's red eyes and anxious face. "Okay, then. Be careful on your way back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mentor, take care. Don't tell Mrs. Watts what happened at the freeway when she wakes up," said Grace. She did not want to deepen Mrs. Watts's guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts nodded, and Grace turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She drove back to Emerald City. She was so anxious to return. She just wanted to see the man whom she had hurt severely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She tried to call his phone on her way back, but he did not pick up. She could only call Uncle Kwan. She learned that Jay had returned to Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she got back to Reed Residence, she anxiously asked Uncle Kwan, "Where's Jay?"</p></div>
