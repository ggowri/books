        <h1>Chapter 1822</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh, watch your mouth. Don't talk nonsense. If Mr. Stephenson knows you're gossiping behind his back, you may lose your job.&rdquo; The other security guard reminded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, the security guard who advised Lina earlier shut his mouth and stopped speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two security guards now seemed to ignore Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina only felt as if her body was getting colder and colder. She seemed to have forgotten that she wanted to see Hadwin Stephenson and what she wanted to tell him. Her mind went blank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina got back to her car step by step, but instead of starting the car to leave, she looked in the direction of the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Maybe... Katherine Jackson just went in for a while. Or maybe Stephenson Group and the Jackson family have some unfinished business...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina kept coming up with all kinds of reasons for Katherine Jackson going into the mansion, but as time went by, it became more and more difficult to convince herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When her phone rang, she saw that it was her mother. Her eyes instantly welled with tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom." She picked up the phone, trying hard to make her voice sound normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's late. Why aren&rsquo;t you home yet?" asked Mrs. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm... sleeping over at Grace's today. I want to talk to her a little longer. I haven't talked to her for a long time," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Aren't you afraid you'll disturb her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace won't think I'm disturbing her. Mom, I... I gotta hang up. I'll go straight to the office tomorrow and go home at night." With that said, Lina hurriedly ended the call. She was afraid her mother would notice something if she went on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After ending the phone call, Lina took a deep breath, put one hand on her stomach, and looked at the mansion again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not go home but stayed in the car. Maybe she wanted an answer&mdash;an answer that would tell her what to do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Hadwin Stephenson, Hadwin Stephenson!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She kept repeating the name in her head. How sincere was he to her? She had instantly fallen for him when he affectionately called out her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She felt as if the time between them had never passed. They were still the same people, loving each other wholeheartedly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She thought they could start over. She thought she could take a chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she was slapped in the face by the cruel reality even before she took the chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the mansion, Hadwin Stephenson's handsome face was distorted because of the pain. He knelt on the floor. His fingers were clenched as he constantly clawed at the floor. Roars of pain kept escaping from his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked like a mess. Who would believe that he was the charming president of Stephenson Group?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I want to live. I must hold on. Once I get through tonight, Lina and I can be together again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Lina and I will have a wonderful future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'After tonight... After tonight...'</p></div>
