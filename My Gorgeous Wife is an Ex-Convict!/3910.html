        <h1>Chapter 3908</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper suddenly snapped out of her thoughts and bit her lip slightly. She said to William, "I'm just wondering who sent this hair clip."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's gaze fell on the exquisite hair clip in her hand. "Do you really have no idea?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, she actually has an answer because this hairpin is a snowflake and was sent anonymously."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems that you do have an answer in your heart," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're not happy, should I throw away this hairpin?" Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William laughed, "How are you going to throw it away? Are you going to throw it directly into the sea?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, that's not impossible," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as he can be at ease, she is willing to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although this gift may have been sent by Lawrence, it is unknown what Lawrence's intention was in sending this hairpin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did he really just want to congratulate her on her engagement?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, there is no longer any friendship between her and Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since it was sent by someone else, there's no need to throw it away," William said, "Besides, it may not necessarily be the person you think it is, so just keep it for now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper put down the hairpin in her hand and stood up, looking at William, "Are you not angry?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just a hairpin, I'm not that petty," William said, "If you want to keep it, keep it. If you want to throw it away, throw it away. I just hope you can do what you want to do without worrying about anything else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She blinked her bright apricot eyes at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sighed and hugged her, "Jasper, I'm not a generous person. Sometimes I may still be petty, jealous, and envious, but one thing will never change, and that is that no matter what, I hope you can be happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This has never changed from the very beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he was discriminated and bullied as a child, she stood in front of him and protected him from the malicious acts. He made a vow to himself that he would do everything in his power to protect her happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as she is happy, it is the best thing for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, he is happy that she has reciprocated his love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He can work even harder to make her happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if one day, the things I have to do will make you unhappy, will you still let me do them?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If the things you insist on doing will make you happy and better off, then even if I am unhappy, I will not stop you," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper suddenly felt a tingling sensation in his nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know I haven't chosen the wrong person. We will get married in three years, okay?" Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since her father believed that she needed three more years to figure out if William was truly her love, she would tell her father in three years that William was the one she had chosen!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," William smiled gently. Three years would pass quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By then, he would make himself stronger, better, and more worthy of her love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By then, even if Lawrence really came back, he would no longer be afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence... Did he give Jasper this snowflake hairpin to make sure she would never forget him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, it was all in vain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper will definitely become Mrs. Barlow in the future! At this moment, William firmly believed this in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p></div>
