        <h1>Chapter 4174 The Wedding Begins</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, compared to Hadwin's attitude, Lina was quite happy. Even though it was still early in her daughter's pregnancy, Lina couldn't resist the urge to start buying things for the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina even began organizing some things her daughter had used when she was a child, intending to dress her future grandchild in them and create a nostalgic experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> On the day of the wedding, Tina was pulled out of bed early in the morning, and a makeup artist started working on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her bridesmaids also had their own makeup artists, who were busy getting them ready.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia, as Tina's best friend, naturally became one of the bridesmaids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> They all stayed close to Tina throughout the preparations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And Tina and Chandler's wedding naturally became the hottest news in Emerald City today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> People online kept posting content about the wedding, and reporters crowded outside the Stephenson family's house and at the wedding venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit looked at the posts online about the two families' weddings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The posts were accompanied by photos, one of which showed Tina in a white wedding dress getting out of a car, with Chandler approaching and holding her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> They looked into each other's eyes, filled with love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Anyone could see the affection in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> No wonder the media called them the most beautiful love story of the year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But this scene in the photo deeply pierced Kit's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was like a precious treasure that he wanted but couldn't have, and he could only watch that treasure belong to someone else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina changed into another wedding dress in the hotel. This dress was for the opening of the wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A makeup artist was touching up her makeup while she played with her phone, browsing through web pages and replying to some messages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Suddenly, Tina froze because she received a picture on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The message was from Eugenia's phone account.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But the photo inside was a picture of Eugenia tied up like a dumpling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> What is going on?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina stared at the photo in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Was it a prank? Was someone trying to scare her with such a picture? Or...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Then her phone rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The caller ID showed Eugenia's name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But when Tina answered the call, she heard a man's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina, your good friend is in my hands. It's all because of you that she ended up in my hands. If you don't appear in front of me in half an hour, I will strip all of your friend's clothes and livestream it online! Then I will tell everyone that because you couldn't save your friend, this is what happened to her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Who are you?" Tina tried to calm herself down. She couldn't panic at a time like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What's wrong, Miss. Stephenson? Can't recognize my voice? Miss. Stephenson, don't you still want to bring me to my demise?" the other person's voice said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was shocked. If there was someone recently who had a grudge against her, then this person was... "Mr. Perkins?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Sure!" The other person gave a disgusting smile. "Whether or not I save your friend depends on your choice. And remember, no calling the police or telling anyone else. Come alone to the location I give you. If I find out you've reported to the police, your friend will be in grave danger!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Okay!" Tina agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "By the way, I should remind you that I've installed surveillance cameras and bugs in inconspicuous places in the hotel, so... if you secretly call the police or tell someone about this, I'll know! Next, you're not allowed to make phone calls or send messages. I will send someone to pick you up."</p></div>
