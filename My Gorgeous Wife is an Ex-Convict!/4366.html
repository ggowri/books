        <h1>Chapter 4364 The Terrifying Power of Habit</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was taken aback. He hadn't expected Lornell to know Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, Lornell had seen Calvert before, that one time they had a meal together at a small shop near the school.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in her eyes, it was just an ordinary chance encounter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also, the Calvert that Lornell mentioned earlier wasn't a "student", but a "model". In other words, Lornell knew that Calvert was working as a model at that time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Do I know Calvert is strange?" Lornell seemed to see her confusion, "I'm afraid that by now, many people in this circle know that Harley from the Hart family has brought a person named Calvert into this circle. Many people are saying that you have taken a liking to this person."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley nearly choked on his spit when he heard what Lornell said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just sincerely wanted to help Calvert, that's all!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In this circle, rumors are bound to arise. I want to keep some distance from you, and it has nothing to do with Calvert," Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? If you're not into him, then why do you insist on keeping your distance from me? Even if we've broken off our engagement, we can still be like we used to be, right?" Lornell said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, her indifferent expression made him feel a bit uncomfortable. He still wanted to see her sweet smile directed at him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, Lornell thought that getting a divorce wasn't a big deal for him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he overlooked the terrifying power of habit. When he had grown accustomed to someone's presence in his life, the sudden absence of that person from his routine would leave him feeling incredibly unsettled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, Harley would often call him, sharing interesting tidbits from her daily life. Even though he found these things quite mundane, she would </span><span>persist</span><span> nonetheless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when all these "boring things" were gone, he surprisingly found himself feeling out of sorts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lately, he had gotten into the habit of picking up his phone, hoping to see a message from her. But in the end, he was always left disappointed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like before?" Harley suddenly chuckled, "Lornell, so you really don't love me after all."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had ever loved her even a little, he would know that letting her interact with him as she used to is such a cruel thing to do. It would only make her cling to her feelings for him even more, sinking deeper and deeper into this quagmire.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell squinted her eyes, her voice laced with a hint of subtle mockery, like a needle piercing his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you so sure that Calvert loves you?" Lornell suddenly said, "As far as I know, he's just a poor boy with no background. Right now, he's only sweet-talking you because you can provide him with good resources and more benefits. If you can't bring him any benefits..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's not like that!" Harley interrupted Lornell, "His current achievements are the result of his own hard work, not the benefits I brought him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell scoffed, "You might fool others with that, but do you even believe it yourself? Do you really think he could attend this charity banquet just as a newbie model? </span><span>Harley,</span><span> don't be so naive. The world is far more complicated than you think!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Lornell said this, her gaze drifted past Harley, landing on a figure standing not too far behind her!</span></p></div>
