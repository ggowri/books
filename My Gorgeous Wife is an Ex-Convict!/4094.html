        <h1>Chapter 4092</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Tina was asked to leave the room, Hunter's servant arranged for her to have a room to bathe in and even prepared clean clothes for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina wasn't sure if she should praise Hunter's attentive servant for this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she washed off all the medicinal smell from her body, she was led by the servant to an antique room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In front of the room sat an old man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina immediately recognized him as Chandler's grandfather and Hunter's current patriarch, whom she had met during her engagement to Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, Grandpa Hunter," Tina greeted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Hunter responded expressionlessly, "How did you come here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I came to see Chandler, so I found my way here," Tina replied candidly, without revealing that she had snuck in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You should know Hunter's rules," Mr. Hunter said sternly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know, but I will marry Chandler soon and enter Hunter's old mansion. It's just a matter of time. So, is it okay for me to come in earlier?" Tina shamelessly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Hunter frowned slightly. This girl looked bold and confident, but her words were so entangling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Regardless, rules are rules. I will have someone escort you out later, and don't come in again before you and Chandler get married," Mr. Hunter said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If this girl wasn't Chandler's fianc&eacute;e and the one who could save Chandler's life, she would have been thrown to the wolves by now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In any case, she must marry Chandler in the future, have children smoothly, and continue the Hunter family line!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The longer she stays with Hunter, the more likely she is to find out his secrets. This could lead to some unexpected changes in their planned marriage!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But I still have to meet with Chandler, he asked me to wait for him!" Tina quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although she was mentally prepared to be sent home by Hunter after being caught, she didn't expect it to happen so soon!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had only spoken a few words with Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, Mr. Hunter obviously ignored Tina's words and called for a servant to come in and escort her out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Wait, I don't..." Tina protested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hunter's servants, one on each side, lifted her up. Although she knew some martial arts, this was Hunter's territory and she was an intruder. It wouldn't be wise to fight back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Besides, there were so many of Hunter's servants that she wouldn't be able to handle them all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just as Tina was thinking about how to persuade the old man to let her stay with Hunter, Chandler's voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Let her go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The servants holding Tina looked to the old man for instructions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The old man frowned and said to Chandler, "She broke the rules!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Rules are made by people. Whether she stays or goes is up to me!" Chandler replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The old man's frown deepened. "Aren't you afraid that letting her stay here will lead to unexpected changes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler took Tina from the servants and said to the old man, "If anything unexpected happens, I will take responsibility for it myself."</p></div>
