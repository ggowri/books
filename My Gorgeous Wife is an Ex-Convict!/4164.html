        <h1>Chapter 4162 Explanation</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina stared at Adele with wide eyes, "Explanation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, shouldn't you give an explanation for sleeping with my son?" Adele spoke bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was taken aback, but then realized that Adele had a point!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she felt like her mind was fragmented, she vaguely remembered pinning Chandler down on the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But last night, she wasn't even thinking about getting intimate with Chandler, so why did it end up like this? She was just having some snacks before...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So... what kind of explanation does Auntie want?" Tina forced herself to look at Adele.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now that you've done this, you should get married right away. After all, you might be carrying a child in your belly now, and I can't let the Hunter family's child be born out of wedlock," Adele said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom!" Chandler was immediately displeased upon hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His mother was clearly pressuring Tina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina lowered her head in confusion, looked at her wrapped body, and then turned to look at Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't use any contraception last night, and Chandler... did he also not use any contraception?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about you? Did you use contraception last night?" Adele retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler felt embarrassed, "I'll make Tina take the pill later." Even though he had always been reluctant to let Tina take pills to avoid damaging her health, he couldn't control himself last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he felt deep remorse in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he had been able to keep his composure last night, things might not have turned out like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Adele looked at Tina, "Miss Stephenson, what do you think? Are you planning to hide this by taking the pill, or do you intend to give me and the Hunter family an explanation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, Tina doesn't owe you anything, let alone the Hunter family. You know best why things turned out this way, don't you?" Chandler angrily stared at his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was something wrong with the snacks yesterday, and now his mother showed up early in the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was no doubt that his mother was behind all of this, just trying to force Tina and him to get married as soon as possible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina looked at the confrontation between mother and son, and the initial awkwardness and panic faded away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The explanation you want, Auntie, does it mean that Chandler and I should get married?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Adele said, "Of course, you wouldn't want to get married when you're already heavily pregnant or have a child out of wedlock. That would invite criticism."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tina is still in school!" Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"University doesn't prevent marriage. She's already reached the legal age for marriage," Adele said. "Getting married won't affect her studies, but having a child out of wedlock will have a bigger impact on her. After all, if she's really pregnant, you know very well that your father and grandfather would never allow the child to be aborted."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, this is our own business, Tina and I will decide for ourselves!" Chandler's face was filled with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Adele raised her voice, "This is not only your business, but also the Hunter family's business. Don't forget, in the old Hunter family mansion, you are the only heir!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina saw that the two of them were about to argue, and quickly spoke up, "I'm willing to get married. Anyway, we're going to get married eventually, so it's better to get married sooner!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This way, she can openly have Chandler!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After she finished speaking, both pairs of eyes looked at her simultaneously.</p></div>
