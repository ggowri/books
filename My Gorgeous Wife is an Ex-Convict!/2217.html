        <h1>Chapter 2215</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, she also gave herself a warning, telling herself not to fall for him. She must not fall for him and make the same mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she let herself fall, perhaps she would be doomed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening of the next day, Jacqueline Bowman drove over to find Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, we agreed to have a simple meal together last time. There's a new restaurant that's really nice. Why don't we go try it out? I even drove over to pick you up. You won't say no, will you?" said Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated slightly before smiling. "Let's have dinner together. Just give me a second." With that said, Kyla told her mother and son where she was going before picking up her bag and leaving the store. She followed Jacqueline Bowman into her car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman took her to a high-end hot pot restaurant, which had become quite popular online recently. It was said to be targeted at the upper class.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla saw the elaborate furnishings and knew the food here would be expensive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they were ordering, a voice suddenly rang out. "Hey, Jacqueline. What a coincidence! Old Wu's here too. Do you wanna say hello to him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked up. The speaker was a middle-aged man in his 40s. He might be talking to Jacqueline Bowman, but he was sizing her up. Besides, there was something uncomfortable about the probing look that seemed to betray his ulterior motives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman got up and said to Kyla, "Kyla, what a coincidence. My man's also here today. I'll go and say hello to him!" With that said, she left with the middle-aged man and headed to a private room not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, Jacqueline Bowman came back and said, "Kyla, my man is having dinner in a private room with some of his friends. They&rsquo;ve just ordered the food and haven't eaten yet. Why don't we join them? After all, the more the merrier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "I don't even know those people. It's not that appropriate. You know I don't like crowds. I just want a quiet meal with you today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, don't say that. It's just a meal. Besides, I told them I'd join them in the private room with a friend. If I go back on my word, my man will be upset and I'll be the one suffering. I... I'll tell you the truth. I haven't even gotten a marriage license with him. If I upset him, he'll get rid of me any time. Kyla, I'm already in my 30s. This man is my future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman spoke pitifully. She even mentioned the kindness she extended to Kyla back in prison. Kyla found it hard to refuse again, so she nodded and said, "Okay, but I want to leave early. As you know, I'm pregnant. I get tired easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course!" Jacqueline Bowman said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two got to the private room. Kyla saw four men in the private room, but there were seven bowls and seven pairs of chopsticks on the table. Three sets were new and had just been placed on the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If two belonged to her and Jacqueline Bowman, then who did the other set belong to?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla somehow had a bad feeling, especially when the way the four men in the room looked at her made her feel like a fish on a hook.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was afraid that the chance encounter here was not coincidental but... intentional!</p></div>
