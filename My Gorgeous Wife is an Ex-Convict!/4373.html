        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on, did something come to mind?" Karen asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, I've figured out some things. Do you have the contact information of the person who wants to sell the scandalous photos?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not thinking of buying those scandalous photos, are you?" Karen said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley </span><span>nodded,</span><span> indeed, she was planning on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me check." Karen made a call to inquire. After ending the call, she said to Harley, "My brother said he'll look into it and call back later. But if you haven't been involved with Calvert and haven't done anything out of line, you probably shouldn't worry about those scandalous photos. Some people just love to make up news. Anyway, once the photos are out, they'll probably be forgotten soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if we do that, it would throw Calvert into a whirlwind of rumors, wouldn't it? His career is on the rise right now, and getting tangled up in this kind of scandal would only make people overlook his hard work," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen curiously asked, "You're so considerate of him, are you sure you're not dating him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I have to be in a relationship with him to care about him? Can't I do that as a friend?" Harley laughed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really think there can be pure friendship between men and women?" Karen asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean there's none? Calvert and I are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You consider him a friend, but does he really see you the same way? Sometimes when he looks at you, he blushes. I think, maybe he likes you," Karen said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He just blushes easily, a bit shy," Harley thought of her several encounters with Calvert. He often lowered his head and spoke in a humble tone, and sometimes, if she stared at him for too long, he seemed quite uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen rolled her eyes speechlessly. Easy to blush? Timid?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like only Harley felt this way. Calvert was then a somewhat famous up-and-coming model, and many people online described him as steady. Some even found him quite aloof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This person seemed quite different from the one Harley described.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Karen's phone suddenly rang. She picked it up and heard her brother's voice on the other end, "Karen, I heard those photos have been bought by someone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's already been bought?" Karen was taken aback, "Do you know who bought it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard it's Lornell, but who knows if it's true or not," the other person said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing the name Lornell, Harley suddenly stiffened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell... why on earth did he want to buy her scandalous photos?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen ended the call and said to Harley, "Why don't you reach out to Lornell and ask if it's true? But why would Lornell want to buy your scandalous photos? Could it be that he doesn't want the world to know that after breaking off your engagement, you quickly got a new boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was instantly exasperated, "Calvert and I are just friends!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I may have </span><span>misspoke</span><span>, but if you truly see Calvert as just a friend, then don't let him misunderstand. After all, when people's expectations are shattered, they can become frightening," Karen cautioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Scary? An image of Calvert flashed through Harley's mind. For some reason, every time she saw him, he gave her the feeling of a little rabbit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of how terrifying such a man could be was honestly a bit hard for her to imagine!</span></p></div>
