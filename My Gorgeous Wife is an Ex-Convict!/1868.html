        <h1>Chapter 1866</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Someone seemed to be sobbing in the dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Who is it? Who's crying?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She tried desperately to push through the darkness and finally found a child sobbing non-stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was a beautiful child with fair tender skin, black hair, and delicate features just like her favorite doll when she was little. Those beautiful peach blossom eyes were especially attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is this... Mick? No, it's not Mick. It's Jay. Was this Jay when he was little?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jay was wearing the same outfit she once saw in his photo album!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She ran up to him as fast as she could and held him in her arms. "Stop crying. Jay, stop crying!" She heard her voice say, then she heard the young voice saying...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ouch! It hurts!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It hurts?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where does it hurt?" she asked immediately. Then, she saw a great surge of red seeping out of the clothes on his chest. The bloodstain only grew bigger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was blood! He was bleeding!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Almost subconsciously, she pressed her hands to his chest, trying to keep the blood from seeping out so quickly but her hand began to be covered in blood too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just as she became terribly anxious, the scene changed again. Jay disappeared. Now, her mentor and his wife were smiling kindly at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, you can leave your child with us if you're busy with work. We'll take care of Jasper for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, the scene changed. She was sorting out case files under a lamp. Mrs. Watts held out a bowl of soup and handed it to her. "Grace, come and have some soup. I've been cooking this soup for hours. It's nutritious!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mrs. Watts, thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's there to thank me for? Your mentor and I have no children. You and Jasper are like our daughter and a granddaughter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At that moment, she only found Mrs. Watts's eyes so gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The scene changed again. She was ill in the hospital. Mrs. Watts had a bad leg but was limping around in the hospital. She helped her get water, go to the bathroom, and clean her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts said, "Just focus on getting better. I'm an old woman, but I can take care of you. All you have to do is get well and be safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had not recovered her memories and remembered her past at the time, but Mrs. Watts felt like a mother to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The scene continued to change, but now, Grace saw Mrs. Watts lying weakly on a broken bed. She had a high fever and was babbling while her mentor took care of her in a fluster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She desperately wanted to get close to her mentor and his wife, but there seemed to be an invisible wall that prevented her from getting close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mentor, Mrs. Watts&hellip; are you two okay? Mrs. Watts!" shouted Grace. Suddenly, she shuddered and opened her eyes. She was greeted by darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was a dream... She had a dream just now. She had a dream about Jay as a child, and she had a dream about her past with Mrs. Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In her last dream, she saw Mrs. Watts lying on a broken bed... It was probably because of Terrence's report during the day...</p></div>
