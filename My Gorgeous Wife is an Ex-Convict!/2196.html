        <h1>Chapter 2194</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper finally seemed happier after hearing that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said, "Do you like William that much? How about this? Why don't I find you another kid who can play the piano very well? Maybe even someone who plays the piano better than William? That way, you can play the piano with your new friend every day and not miss William that much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But the other kid won&rsquo;t be William. Even if you ask another kid to play the piano with me, I&rsquo;ll still miss William!" said Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't you like William because he plays the piano well?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper blinked, tilted her head, and thought for a long time before saying, "I'm not sure either. I just like William, and William likes me very much. He'll miss me very much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason smiled and did not pursue the topic. 'Like... Perhaps my daughter isn't very clear about what she means by that word.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, at least the two children had separated. He would find another sensible child to take William's place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Children were fickle. Perhaps Jasper would not bother to come to Deer City after several school holidays.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, William was not the right person for Jasper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, outside the airport, William watched the plane rise in the sky and fly away into the distance. He lost sight of it in a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why didn't you show up in front of Jasper to see her off in person? Is watching the plane good enough?" asked Philip Barlow as he looked at his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked down and only said, "Let's go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow returned to the car with his son. "Won't you regret not following Jasper back to Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's similar dark eyes looked up at him. "You, Grandpa, and Grandma wouldn&rsquo;t have let me go to Emerald City, no?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're right." Philip Barlow smiled. His son was indeed not a fool. "Even if you want to return to the Reed family&rsquo;s house, we won't let you go. You're now a member of the Barlow family, so you should live with us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Without saying more, William took a chocolate from his pocket, unwrapped it, and put it in his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was one of the chocolates Jasper gave him yesterday. It was sweet and delicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... he wanted more than chocolates and dolls from Jasper... It was only possible by staying with the Barlow family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After returning to Emerald City, Grace first went to Kyla to tell her about William and that she had informed William of the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "When William comes back to Emerald City to visit Jasper, Nelson and I want to apologize and thank him in person. Nelson would&rsquo;ve been hurt if it weren&rsquo;t for William. I heard Lina say that the police found out what had happened yesterday. A servant's child climbed up the tree to shoot a bird with an air gun but missed and the bullet shot toward the mansion. The window was open, so the bullet shot straight inside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla still shuddered at the thought that the outcome might have been different if William had been a second later in pushing her son out of danger. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze. "They found out so soon? Fortunately, the person behind it is just a child of a servant who was playing with air guns. At least it&rsquo;s not someone with ulterior motives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, Lina was injected with poison when she gave birth, so Grace was afraid that the culprit behind this air gun bullet incident was the same person who wanted to hurt Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla understood what Grace was afraid of as well, so she said, "Yes, it's just an accident. I wonder if Hadwin Stephenson found out who wanted to hurt Lina. Lina's lucky to have had a narrow escape."</p></div>
