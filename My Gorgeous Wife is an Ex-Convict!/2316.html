        <h1>Chapter 2314</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her fingers stubbornly refused to let go, so he increased his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her fingers... felt the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you still won't let go, you&rsquo;ll be the only one to suffer.&rdquo; There was a note of impatience in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said in a panic, "Martin, I know I shouldn't bother you, but I really have something important to say. I... I have a friend called Amber Mitchell who helped me a lot when I was in prison and when I gave birth to Nelson. But I've lost contact with her over the years. Jacqueline Bowman knows where Amber Mitchell is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla quickly told him Jacqueline Bowman's request. "I hope you can issue a memorandum of understanding and tell your lawyer about this matter so that Jacqueline Bowman can be given probation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Kyla coldly. "You want me to spare a woman who nearly killed me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. Jacqueline Bowman had aimed to harm her, not Martin Weiss. However, Martin Weiss was the one who ended up on the operating table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If there had not been enough blood that day, Martin Weiss might have bled to death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry, I... I just want to find out Amber Mitchell's whereabouts because Jacqueline Bowman said Amber Mitchell is living a miserable life and is worse off than being dead right now," she said, her nose feeling sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Worse off than being dead?" muttered Martin Weiss as the way he looked at Kyla grew colder. "Your friend 'might' only be worse off than being dead, yet you're already so anxious and worried. Do you know I've been worse off than being dead over the years? Were you ever worried about me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." She opened her mouth but did not know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Kyla, you've never given me a spot in your heart. You have no feelings for me, so you don't care whether I'm miserable or not. I used to be willing to do everything for you because of guilt, remorse, and love. But I don't love you anymore, so things aren't the same as they used to be."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can't you... help me one last time? Think of it as I owe you a favor. I&rsquo;ll return it one day!" she said with a shudder in her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why should I?" Those three words seemed to send her to hell in a heartbeat as her heart sank instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, why should he? Perhaps I could have relied on his affection for me if it was before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But he no longer has feelings for me. What can I do?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, what do you think an owner of a store like you can give me? I have everything I need. What can you give me that I don't have? Feelings? What a pity. I previously begged you to give me a chance, but you refused. Your feelings are no longer important to me. I don't want them even if you want to give them to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a sudden force of his hand, he pried her fingers away from his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I hope you'll keep your word. Let's never meet each other again!" His cold voice rang out in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, what she saw was his back as he turned away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was so decisive that there was not a trace of reluctance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's fingers quivered slightly with a tinge of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the pain was so faint compared to the suffocating pain in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out his words could cause her so much pain.</p></div>
