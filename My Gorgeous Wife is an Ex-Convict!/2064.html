        <h1>Chapter 2062</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once William returned to Deer City, his status would change dramatically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, William was still here, and Philip Barlow surprised her by not taking him away by force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even so, she knew that the boy would return to Deer City one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked a little nervous. He had a feeling Grace knew his father had come looking for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he never told anyone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," he answered softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once they arrived at Reed Residence, Jasper took William to the piano room to practice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The huge piano room had become their private domain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper and William played three pieces by Beethoven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It would have been difficult for even two adults, let alone two children. However, the two cooperated well with each other. Four little hands moved quickly on the piano keys without a single mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When they stopped playing, the beautiful sound seemed to still echo throughout the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper had a fun time. She turned to William with a smile. "I enjoy playing with you the most. It's much more interesting than playing with adults."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although she had played with teachers and adults who played the piano better than her or William, she was always bored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, playing the piano with William made her happy. She would want to continue playing with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, what she said did not make William as happy as usual. He said gloomily instead, "Do you... only enjoy playing the piano with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, I like you too!" said Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do you like about me?" asked William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I like that you play the piano, and I like that you uh... look so cute you look like a doll. It's also comfortable to hold you to sleep at night. Besides, you're nice to me..." Jasper counted with her fingers and finally concluded, "In short, I like all of you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So do you like me more than Nelson, or do you like Nelson more?" he asked. The thought of her holding Nelson Corbyn while crying upset him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he had no idea then that the emotion was called... jealousy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper blinked with confusion on her face. "I don't know which one of you I like better. I like you, but I also like Nelson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Disappointment flashed across William's little face, and he suddenly hugged Jasper Reed. The two small bodies hugged each other in front of the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Can you... like me more?" he muttered. He wanted to be her favorite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why?" she asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He hesitated for a moment before finally saying what was on his mind. "Because I like you, Jasper." He liked her more than anything else in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper mumbled, "I think I like both of you. Why don't I try to like you more in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William widened his eyes and looked at Jasper with surprise. "Then you must keep your word. You can't lie!"</p></div>
