        <h1>Chapter 1900</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the next few days, Grace refused to leave the old mansion. Wherever Jason went, she would go with him. When Jason went to bed at night, she would squeeze into his bed, claiming that they were husband and wife, so of course, they were going to sleep together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even if she had to suffer his silent treatment, she bit the bullet and clung to him like taffy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Maybe there was no limit to human potential, just like how she never thought she would be so shameless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For the two children who were still in Reed Residence, Grace would go on video calls with them as much as possible. She felt guilty for leaving them for so many days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick was doing alright, but Jasper had always been with her since she was born. When she had to go on business trips in the past, she would only ask her mentor and his wife to take care of Jasper for one or two days at most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was the fourth day now. During the video call, Jasper anxiously asked her now and then when she would be back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I&rsquo;ll be back soon, and Daddy will be back too. He and I will take you, Mason, William, Sis Veronica, and Brother Nelson to the amusement park, okay?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her words immediately caught Jasper Reed's attention. When she heard that many of them would be going to the amusement park together, she was instantly delighted and nodded her small head as she said yes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed looked at Grace through the screen and asked, "Is Mommy coming home 'with' Daddy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one emphasized the word &lsquo;with&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze and smiled. "We will! Don't worry, Mick! Because I... love Daddy the most, and Daddy loves me the most!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That had never changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the old mansion's study, Jason went through the documents Terrence handed as he gave him some orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Jason would glance at the study&rsquo;s door from time to time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence understood what he was thinking and said, "Young master Reed, Young Madam is having a video call with Little Young Master and Little Young Lady right now. She probably won't be here soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason glanced coldly at Terrence. "Did I ask you this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence immediately shut his mouth obediently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">How dishonest Young master Reed was. He cared about Young Madam but refused to make up with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a while, Terrence could not help saying again, "Young master Reed, Young Madam did fall into the sea to save you so you wouldn&rsquo;t die. What Young Madam said is the truth!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason stared at Terrence, "I remember you mentioning this before. I already told you that I believe what I remember more. Besides, you've also looked up Dr. Joseph and there's nothing wrong with him, right? The hypnosis treatment he gave me that day was recorded on video. Nothing was wrong about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But..." Terrence wanted to go on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Jason said, "How much did you take from her to defend her like this?"</p></div>
