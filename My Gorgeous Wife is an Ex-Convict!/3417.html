        <h1>Chapter 3415</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, there's another guest here. Hurry up and attend to them!" a classmate shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica saw several boys enter the room, laughing and joking around, and among them was Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel saw Veronica and greeted her with a smile, "Hello, nice to see you again. Is your shoulder injury feeling better?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's all good now. Here's the menu. What would you like to eat?" Veronica offered the menu proactively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few boys ordered a few bottles of drinks, and Veronica turned around to get the drinks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of the boys said, "Hey Daniel, you always used to stare at this classroom before. I wonder what's so interesting about this place that serves only snacks and drinks for afternoon tea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's interesting is not just any afternoon tea, but when our waitress, who happens to be a younger female student, asked Mr. Cross how his shoulder was as soon as he walked in and we heard it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel said, "It was from the last time we played ball when your ball hit her shoulder."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, so it was this junior sister!" someone recalled. "Back then, you accompanied this junior sister to the school clinic, didn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could it be that you've developed feelings while keeping them company?" teased the others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel gave a slight smile, but did not deny it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, Veronica brought drinks and placed them on the table. She was about to leave when suddenly one of the guys said, "Hey, underclassman, wait a minute. Mr. Cross has something to say to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica paused, stopped walking, and turned to look at Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I didn't..." Daniel was about to say, but his friend interrupted, "Mr. Cross here wants to ask the junior sister when her shift ends so they can hang out together during the school anniversary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, when we came here earlier, we saw some classes setting up haunted houses. Later, you can go check them out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, Mr. Cross is brave. You don't have to be afraid to enter the haunted house with him. He will protect you, little sister!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel's face turned slightly red, he stood up and said to Veronica, "Don't listen to them, but... if you're free later, do you want to go for a walk together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel took the initiative to invite Veronica, and there was a hint of anticipation in her gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was about to answer when a voice spoke up first, saying, "She's not available, and she definitely won't go with you to any haunted houses."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was startled and turned her head to see Mason standing beside her, though she didn't know when he had arrived. At that moment, his handsome face was filled with a cold and fierce expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason!" Veronica said, "What are you doing...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Or is it that you, sister, want to go to the haunted house with this person?" Mason turned his head, his dark eyes fixed tightly on Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was taken aback and before she could say anything, someone next to her spoke up, "Hey? Little sister, is this your brother? In the same class as you? Hey little brother, it's not okay to stop your sister from dating, you know!"</p></div>
