        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson raised his hands and gently pulled Lina's hands down into his palms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But even so, I gave her a way out. I didn't give the evidence to the police right away. I just made sure she won&rsquo;t be able to leave her home for the rest of her life. I'm sorry... I'm sorry..." muttered Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kept his head down and apologized profusely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said, "Hadwin, you've done enough for me. Don't apologize again. You've done nothing wrong! You made sure your mother can never leave her house, and that&rsquo;s no different from imprisonment. Did you think I would still blame you or think you were being partial to your mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." He opened his mouth. The woman in front of him seemed to know what he feared most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm glad that you didn't keep me in the dark. You claimed justice for me. Even though the culprit is your mother, you still acted on my behalf and didn&rsquo;t cover it up or act as if nothing ever happened," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He froze before slowly looking up again. "You're glad?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'm glad. I'm glad to have you protect me like that, but... I'm also upset because I know you must be very upset now, right?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, he would have gone home instead of staying in the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew he did not want her to see him upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin, you don't need to hide your emotions in front of me. She's your mother, and I know... you still..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not anymore!" said Hadwin Stephenson. After all these incidents, he could not have seen her colors more clearly. "Lina, I&rsquo;ll only live for you and our child from now on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He muttered and kissed her lips!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was his promise to her. It was the most important promise he had ever made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's heart was full of sorry for the man. She would love him with all she had for the rest of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">... </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the hospital's VIP ward, Martin Weiss was lying on the hospital bed as the nurse inserted a needle into his forearm and drew blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A doctor in a white coat said to Martin Weiss as they held the test report, "Mr. Weiss, your physical test report is out. You're in good health. Although you had part of your liver removed five years ago, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with your liver and everything is fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will I have enough liver to donate if I need to do it again?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." The doctor instantly hesitated when they heard that. "You just donated your liver five years ago. Although the human liver will grow again, it has only been five years. If you have to donate again, the risk will be much greater than the first time. As a doctor, I don't recommend you donating again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That means there's still a chance of success, right?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." The doctor hesitated a little. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still a possibility of success, but it's very small."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I see. Besides that..." Martin Weiss glanced at the blood surging toward the blood bag. "I'll store my blood in your hospital. I'll come over to donate my blood every once in a while. If my wife needs a lot of blood when she goes into labor, at least the hospital won't be lacking it. But I hope the hospital won't tell anyone about it, including my wife."</p></div>
