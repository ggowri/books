        <h1>Chapter 651</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Forget it, Jay. Grandma just passed away, so I don't want to bother her," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'After all, Third Aunt is Grandma's daughter!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how angry she was with Third Aunt, she did not want to bother her grandmother at such a time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hoped she could at least let Grandma leave in peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," Jason replied softly and let go of Third Aunt's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt stumbled and retreated a few steps before she regained her footing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a pale face, Third Aunt clutched her still-aching wrist and glared at Grace. However, she dared not march forward like before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You skank, when Stella comes, you'll..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish, another voice immediately said, "What do you need, Mom?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up to see her cousin, Stella Lindsay, walking in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay was wearing Chanel's latest collection and her bag was also a classic Chanel bag. She had on delicate makeup and her hair was not tied up as casually as before. Instead, she had it curled and let it down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked completely different. She was like a new person, but what made Grace even more surprised was that the person who walked in with Stella Lindsay was... Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dressed in a black suit, Brian looked thinner than before. Although he was still handsome, he had a tired look on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, she had not seen Brian ever since he came to the small restaurant to ask her whether she was marrying Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect to see Brian here and... With her cousin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could it be that&hellip; The powerful man Third Aunt said her cousin had met was Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Brian walked in, his eyes fell on Grace with a mixture of expectation and surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew she would come. Her grandmother had died, so of course, she would come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, when he heard that Stella Lindsay was going to the hospital, he came too, telling himself that he was only here because of Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was another voice in his heart saying he was here to see the person in front of him. He thought he could have an open and aboveboard reason to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she was not the one he was looking for!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only, he was still surprised when he arrived. He did not expect her to appear in front of him in a wedding dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked so beautiful in a pure white wedding dress. She was like a serene angel that people could not help wanting to get close to and to protect. One would want her eyes to be filled with their figure.</p></div>
