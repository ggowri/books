        <h1>Chapter 418</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face could not help turning red. She bit her lip a little and said to Kyla Corbyn, "He's my boyfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your boyfriend?!" Kyla Corbyn's eyes widened immediately. She had felt something between them from their conversation earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Boyfriend?! Grace had a boyfriend?! He seemed like an enigmatic man too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, enigmatic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was what Kyla Corbyn felt. Even though the man had a smile on his face and looked harmless, she would never think that the man was harmless. Instead, her instinct told her that the man was dangerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was something supercilious about the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, my boyfriend," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, I'm Kyla Corbyn, the owner of this restaurant," said Kyla Corbyn as she introduced herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, I'm Jason," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was once again stunned. The surprise in her eyes grew more and more evident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This Jason was not the person she had in mind, right? Kyla Corbyn could only feel her head spinning right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian and Jason had come to her restaurant all of a sudden, and both men were here for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who the hell was... Grace? Was she really what she said on her resume?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stood up and came this way too. However, he only said to Jason, "I really don't want to go against you right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After speaking, his eyes fell on Grace's face. "The film crew of my company did you wrong yesterday. I only came here today to apologize on behalf of the crew. If you've suffered any damage, just say so and I'll compensate you for your trouble.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no damage, so you don't have to pay anything. Thank you for yesterday though," replied Grace immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? Well then, I have to get going," said Brian, giving Jason another meaningful look before leaving the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Grace's place in his heart had not reached the point where he would be willing to make enemies with Jason. Brian lowered his eyes and laughed at himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would not go against Jason for Grace, but Jason would go against him for Grace. This only meant that Grace held much more importance in Jason's heart than she held in his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he really wanted was to find the little girl whose name he did not even know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He once again ran his fingers over his heart, and through his clothes, he could reach the little silver bracelet hanging by the chain on his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like a token against his skin and his heartbeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When on earth would he find her? He had so many things to say to her. He wanted to tell her how much he missed her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at Jason who sat back at his table. He was still drinking his coffee gracefully and was even leafing through a German book as if it was true that he was waiting here for Grace to get off work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was Jason... The Jason who ruled Emerald City.</p></div>
