        <h1>Chapter 2209</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No one's giving me trouble. You don't have to help me," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I see. That's a relief." Jacqueline Bowman acted as if she cared for Kyla like a sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, let's have a meal together when you're free. It'll be my treat. We must celebrate our reunion after all these years," said Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." Kyla hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't even want to have a meal with me? Others tried to beat you up when you were pregnant back then. I felt sorry for you and begged them to let you go." Jacqueline Bowman mentioned what had happened in the past once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "Okay, let's have dinner together, but it's going to be my treat. I should thank you for helping me back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whose treat it is doesn&rsquo;t matter. That's settled, then. We'll go out for a good meal the next time I visit you!" With that said, Jacqueline Bowman left in satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla sighed. For some reason, she felt vaguely uneasy. She had a feeling that Jacqueline Bowman seemed eager for the meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Kyla could not help laughing and shook her head. It was only a meal, and she was overthinking it. Besides, she had nothing that Jacqueline Bowman would want. She was only the owner of a store. She had no power and money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was obviously living a good life. Maybe she just wanted to have a meal with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a neighbor came to the store to buy something. While shopping around, they asked, "Hey, did you quarrel with your husband?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Kyla froze a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That neighbor said again, "Your husband has been parking his car at the corner of the store these days. He just looks at you as he sits in the car. He doesn&rsquo;t get down nor come inside. Are you two quarreling and not on speaking terms?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. 'Martin Weiss... has been here all this while?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In my opinion, you're already pregnant, so what&rsquo;s there to quarrel about? Talk it over, even if it's for the sake of the children. Do you want a divorce when you&rsquo;ve just gotten married? Besides, your husband looks pretty well off. Why does he let you continue running the store? He should let you live the life of a young madam and have several servants take care of you." The neighbor continued to gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla replied vaguely, "I quite enjoy my life right now, and I don't want any changes. I told him about it... before we got married. He's usually busy at work anyway, so some things can wait."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&rsquo;ve finally gotten married. Don't be foolish and ignore him. I think your husband wants to make up too. Otherwise, he wouldn't hide in a corner to look at you. Just give him an out and have some pillow talks. Take control of his finances too. Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll suffer miserably and end up with nothing when he has an affair because this fight had gone on for too long.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla could only smile drily at that. Her marriage to Martin Weiss was destined to be short-lived from the beginning. It was only a temporary solution, and she never wanted anything else from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once the neighbor left, Kyla walked out of the store and looked around. However, she did not see Martin Weiss's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He... didn't come today?' She turned around and returned to the store. She did not have the slightest clue that Martin Weiss was having his blood drawn in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Another 400 milliliters of blood was drawn from his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he finished having his blood drawn, Martin Weiss's face was a little pale and he seemed slightly exhausted.</p></div>
