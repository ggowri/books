        <h1>Chapter 2093</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when she said these two words, tears still fell down her face. Her heart seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day, Kyla went to the hospital and told the doctor she wanted a medical abortion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Have you discussed it with your husband? At your age, it&rsquo;ll be hard for you to get pregnant again if you proceed with this," the doctor said. After all, they remembered Martin Weiss asking about morning sickness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He's not my husband, and I think it's up to me to decide whether to have the baby or not. Isn't it my right as a woman to decide whether to give birth or not?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctor prescribed the medicine when they saw Kyla's resolution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With heavy steps, Kyla walked to the hospital's dispensary and stood in line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once she took the pill, that baby inside her would be officially gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even if she had thought about keeping the baby, she was still a little afraid to take the bet. She could not bet on what would happen to her and Martin Weiss after the baby was born as well as how much damage the neighbors' gossip would do to Nelson and her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, maybe... she could only be sorry to her unborn child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Baby, if you get another chance at birth, choose a better mother and not one like me," muttered Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was her turn, and she handed her medical insurance card to the pharmacy staff. Moments later, she was handed her card back as well as the abortion pills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla took the medicine and card. She was about to put them in her bag when a hand suddenly grabbed her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze. Her heart instantly sank when she looked up and saw who it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss! He appeared before her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Martin Weiss was staring intently at the box of pills she was holding with a ghastly pale face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She tried to free her wrist from his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, his fingers were like rebars, and she could not break free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you going to abort the baby?" he asked hoarsely. It was as if every word was being squeezed out of his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," she said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His gaze shifted from the box to her face. His deep dark eyes glared at her. "How could you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She asked in reply, "Why can't I? I have the right to decide whether to have the baby or not. No one has the right to interfere."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But it's my baby too!" He roared. He felt like he could no longer contain his pent-up emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla felt only as if her wrist was about to break as the pain was severe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, let go!" she said with a frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He pressed his thin lips together tightly as he snatched the box of pills from her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hey, what are you going to do?" she asked quickly, trying to get the medicine back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Martin Weiss threw the medicine into the trash can.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla panicked when she saw that. "Martin Weiss, what are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She hurriedly wanted to pick the medicine up from the trash can, but he had already grabbed her wrist to take her away from the hospital.</p></div>
