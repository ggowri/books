        <h1>Chapter 3295</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper strongly objected to temporarily separating from Lawrence for piano lessons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do we have to take separate classes?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because Mommy signed you up for a self-defense class to learn some techniques. The course isn't very long, only two months. After that, you can go back to taking piano lessons with Lawrence," Grace explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Self-defense?" Jasper blinked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your two brothers know some fighting techniques. If they ever encounter bad people without bodyguards, they can at least run away. You should also learn some self-defense skills," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For example, Mick and Jason had someone teach their children various fighting techniques when they were three years old. As for Mason, he was initially raised by Secretary Wylie in a bloody way. Compared to Mick, Mason was no less skilled in this area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other hand, Jasper had always been with her daughter. Although they were not wealthy at first, they never suffered. Later, when she reunited with Jason, Jasper was almost spoiled by him. She was afraid that her daughter would get hurt and would not let her learn any fighting techniques.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, learning this kind of thing would inevitably result in some bruises and minor injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Grace believed that it would be better for girls to learn some self-defense skills, at least to have some ability to defend themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, she convinced her husband to let their daughter learn this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After listening to Grace's words, Jasper lowered her head and thought for a moment before nodding. "Okay, then after two months, I want to learn piano with Lawrence again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Grace smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll let Lawrence know," said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mommy will talk to Lawrence," Grace said. After all, children can't keep secrets, especially after experiencing a debt collection situation. The child was probably also quite scared and might accidentally reveal something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace doesn't want her daughter to know that Wilona used her and Lawrence's piano lessons to scam people using the Reed family name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She doesn't want her daughter to overthink things and potentially affect the friendship between her and Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Child, it's better to be carefree and worry-free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I want to meet Lawrence," said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How about this, why don't you learn some self-defense skills first? Once you've learned them, you can show Lawrence and even teach him," suggested Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper thought about it and thought it sounded good, so he agreed right away, saying, "Okay, I'll learn a bit first and then go find Lawrence!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the next few days, Jasper's piano lessons were scheduled at different times than Lawrence's, and Jasper was also busy learning self-defense techniques.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was quite worried when he found out that Jasper was learning self-defense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's actually okay if you don't learn, I will protect you!" said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I'm not with you every day, and besides, Mom said that I can't always rely on others and I need to know how to protect myself," said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William looked at Jasper on the video call on his phone and said very seriously, "Jasper, from now on, I will make sure to be with you every day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about later? When will that be?" Jasper asked eagerly. "Is your family moving? Will you be moving to Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not about moving, it's about me. From now on, wherever you go, I'll be there," he said with a hint of childishness in his voice, but his determination was unwavering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How long is that?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When we grow up." By then, he should be strong enough too, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Strong enough to stand by her side, strong enough to protect her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, from now on, we'll be together every day," Jasper said with a smile. However, at this moment, she didn't realize the kind of commitment she had just made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the weekend, Grace received a call while accompanying her daughter to a piano lesson. The call was regarding a recent case her law firm had taken on, and there were some issues with the witnesses.</p></div>
