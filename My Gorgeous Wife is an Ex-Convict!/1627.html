        <h1>Chapter 1625</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sometime later, the bathroom door opened. Lina had changed into the clothes Hadwin Stephenson gave her and walked out of the bathroom. She said to Hadwin Stephenson, "Show me your QR code, I'll transfer you the money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I already told you, there's no need for that," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I also told you we have nothing to do with each other now, so it's better not to owe each other money." Lina insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two looked at each other, and there seemed to be something depressing in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina bit her lip slightly. "Hadwin Stephenson, now that we&rsquo;ve broken up, I... don't want to owe you anything, so don't let me owe you anything, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His body trembled a little, but he finally took out his phone and showed her his QR code.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina scanned his QR code and keyed in the number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, when he gave her the clothes, the price tags were still attached, so she knew the prices. Lina could not help but feel a burst of pain at the thought of it. The outfit she was wearing cost two months of her salary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she had to pay him so she would feel at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After paying the money, Lina put her phone away and held out her hand to Hadwin Stephenson. "By the way, I heard you're going to marry Miss Jackson soon. Congratulations, I hope you can grow old with her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's expression changed slightly, and he said in a hoarse voice, "Are you... giving me your blessing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes." Even though they had broken up, she still wanted him to be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stared at her outstretched hand with a complicated look. A long time passed before he reached out and took her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He did not want to let go of his grip now. Even a handshake like this caused him great pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He tightly held her hand as his face grew paler and paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina noticed that something was wrong with Hadwin Stephenson. "What's come over you? Your face..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He suddenly let go of her, staggered a step back, and caught his breath before saying, "I'm alright."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked at him suspiciously and saw that he seemed to be all right besides looking a little pale. Therefore, without saying another word, she turned and walked to the door. She pulled it open and went out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stayed in the room alone. He put the hand that he had used to shake her hand in front of him. He looked down, and his gaze fell on his trembling hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it an extravagant hope... to even touch her now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Am I going to go on like this all my life?' The moment she left the room, he even wanted to stop her to ask her to give him a little more time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she would only give him a little more time, he would find a way to solve all the problems and give her a future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... what he wanted to say got stuck on the tip of his tongue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not yet the end. He could not drag her down again no matter what. He could not repeat his mistakes. All that mattered to him was that... she was safe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson picked up the clothes lying aside and went into the bathroom to clean up the mess on his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her scent seemed to linger in the bathroom, and he yearned for it.</p></div>
