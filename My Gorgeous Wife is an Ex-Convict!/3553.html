        <h1>Chapter 3551</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Jasper's phone rang and he checked to see that it was a call from William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she answered, William's voice came through, "Jasper, where are you? I heard from your dorm mates that you didn't come back to the dorm this afternoon?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm outside now, it'll be a while before I can get back to school," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I'll wait for you and we'll have dinner together," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Jasper was about to agree, Roger next to her said, "It's already dinner time, let's find a place nearby to eat first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Jasper was taken aback, and William on the other end of the phone also heard Roger's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, who are you with?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm with Roger now, um... William, why don't you skip dinner with me and I'll come back to school after I finish eating outside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the phone, after a moment of silence, William said, "Okay, do you want me to come pick you up later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it's okay. I'll come back after I finish eating," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After ending the call, she looked up and saw Roger looking at her with an indescribable expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing," he shrugged. "The person who called you earlier, was it your friend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, we've known each other since we were kids. His name is William," she said, watching his reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But to her disappointment, his face remained calm after hearing the name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Have you heard of this name before?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have heard of it," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She immediately asked excitedly, "When did you hear of this name?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William, your childhood friend Jasper's name is well-known in school. You can find out about him just by checking the school forum," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I see," she sighed. Ever since their scandalous photos were posted on the school forum, the popular threads were all about speculating the relationship between the three of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How else do you think I found out?" he retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She touched her nose and once again guessed whether he was Lawrence or not. She wondered if his "I don't know" was intentional concealment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go eat," he said, leading the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She quickly followed behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them found a noodle shop. The shop was small with an old-fashioned decor, but it was quite crowded inside and had good business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger found a seat and Jasper sat down with him. However, when it came to choosing what kind of noodles to order, she just stared at the menu in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What, don't want to eat noodles here? Do you think the environment is too poor? The food is too simple?" Roger taunted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked up at him and asked, "Do you really dislike me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean?" he asked in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because you always seem to enjoy mocking me," she said. "I don't mind eating noodles here, and I don't think the environment is bad or the food is simple. I didn't always live a privileged life. Before I was five years old, my mom and I ate simple box lunches and sat on the side of the road eating bread..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although those were memories from before she was five years old, many of them were still clear in her mind, and she remembered what life was like back then.</p></div>
