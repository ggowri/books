        <h1>Chapter 1478</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason almost ran out of the consulting room in a panic. He ordered Grace's bodyguard, Huang Qian, and the replacement doctor to return to the consulting room. The doctor who was supposed to diagnose Grace had been knocked out by Brian's men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Master Reed, are you okay?" asked Terrence. After all, Master Reed looked pale at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm... fine." Jason gasped almost with difficulty. He did not expect that he was still afraid. He was afraid she would say she regretted it. Even if she had not thought of getting a divorce, he was afraid she would think of it someday. He was afraid that she did not love him enough...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was afraid of so many things!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Have you found Secretary Wang?" Jason raised his hand to wipe the thin layer of sweat on his forehead and asked Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Not yet," said Terrence. Since Old Master Reed's funeral, Secretary Wang, who previously worked for Old Master Reed, had gone missing. Even though they had sent extra people to look for Secretary Wang, they still had not found him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Keep looking for him. As long as he hasn't left Emerald City, find him even if we have to dig three feet in the ground!" said Jason, his face covered with a layer of gloom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang had always been his grandfather's confidant. His grandfather probably did more than just email Brian about the truth of the incident. There should be something else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Otherwise, Secretary Wang would not have gone missing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes!" Terrence quickly replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Enhance Reed Residence's security system and station more people around Grace," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If his grandfather had given some orders to Secretary Wang before his death, Grace was probably the one Old Master Reed wanted to get rid of the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would protect Grace no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After coming out of the hospital, Grace did not see Jason again. It was as if Jason had never appeared in front of her at all when she came to the hospital today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Instead, Terrence came up to her and said with a smile, "Young Madam, Master Reed asked me to send you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I want to go to the hospital Lina is at to see her first," said Grace as she had not visited Lina for days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Can&rsquo;t I go wherever I want? Or do you need to check with your superior?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is... Jay afraid I'm going to leave, so he's restricting my movements?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence immediately smiled awkwardly and said, "Young Madam, of course, there's no problem with you seeing Miss Lina." With that, Terrence turned his head around and gave the orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace got into the car, she found that she was followed by several other cars in the front, at the back, as well as on the left and right. People who had no idea would think some big shot was out on a trip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't need so many people following me, do I?" Grace could not help asking.</p></div>
