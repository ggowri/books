        <h1>Chapter 4088</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Should she knock on Hunter's door openly or sneak in secretly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she were to sneak in, the Crypt families, like Hunter's, would have a top-notch security system. With her abilities, she might not have a chance to sneak in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Tina walked through the bushes towards Hunter's mansion, she saw a truck parked on the side of the road.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone was changing the tires and grumbling, "We're almost there, and now the tire is flat. What bad luck!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But for Tina, it was good luck!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina looked around and saw no one nearby. The driver changing the tires didn't notice her, so she quietly snuck onto the truck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> On the car, there were vegetables, meat, and fruits, probably being transported to Hunter's place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, there are no other residences nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> I'm afraid this whole area belongs to Hunter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina hid in the back of the truck. After about half an hour, the driver changed the tire and started the engine again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The car slowly moved forward, and Tina saw Hunter's old mansion through the gap in the cargo compartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was an ancient-style building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Simple yet solemn! It exuded a sense of history and majesty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Is this Hunter's ancestral home?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because it's the Crypt family, outsiders are not allowed to enter easily?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But she is Chandler's fianc&eacute;e. Does she really have to wait until they get married to enter here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> What secrets are hidden here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And... will she really see another side of Chandler here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If... it really exists!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The car stopped, and the truck driver got off to exchange work with Hunter's servants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina seized the opportunity to slip out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The most important thing now is to find Chandler in Hunter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hunter gave her a feeling of emptiness. The mansion was so large that it seemed deserted, and even if she occasionally saw some servants, she could avoid them if she was careful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for the obvious surveillance cameras above the mansion, Tina had noticed them all and avoided them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... Hunter's mansion was too big!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina didn't have a map with her, so after walking for a while, she realized that she was lost!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had no idea where to go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To make matters worse, she hadn't seen anyone around here yet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, even if she shouted loudly, she might not be able to attract anyone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Um... what should she do now? Calling Chandler wouldn't work, as he wouldn't answer the phone once he returned to Hunter's family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Should she wait to be found and then... kicked out of the mansion?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina wasn't worried about her personal safety, as she was Chandler's fianc&eacute;e and would eventually be able to enter the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was just annoyed at her lack of preparation. She thought she could find Chandler's room by herself, but when she arrived at Hunter's mansion, she realized it was much larger than she had imagined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't know where to start looking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, Tina started walking around aimlessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she walked, she came to a strange-looking hall with the word "worship" written in front of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she walked inside, she was greeted by a portrait of a woman hanging on the wall directly in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The woman in the portrait was stunningly beautiful, exuding a strong and intense aura.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This intensity made it difficult to discern whether the woman was good or bad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Beneath the portrait was a table with incense burning and fruits and snacks laid out, as if in a religious ceremony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who was this woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was she one of Hunter's ancestors?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina wondered to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, footsteps could be heard outside, causing Tina to instinctively hide under the table.</p></div>
