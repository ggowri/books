        <h1>Chapter 4187 Saving Lives with Money</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The two of them stared at each other through the car window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit could hardly believe what he was seeing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was... Tina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even though she was wearing dirty clothes and her hair was messy, he immediately recognized her as Tina, the person he had been searching for for six months, the person he loved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit trembled as he reached out to unbuckle his seatbelt, opened the car door, and hurried to Tina's side, afraid that it was just a dream in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Save me, please, save me, and my baby in my belly!" she pleaded desperately, her face full of anguish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina, what happened? Is someone trying to harm you?" Kit asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just then, footsteps approached, and soon a large group of people, shining flashlights, came towards them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina instinctively covered her face with her hand to shield herself from the light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Catch her, Drogo's wife is here!" someone shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In no time, those people surrounded Kit and Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No, I... I'm not..." Tina nervously grabbed Kit's arm, as if he was her only lifeline in front of this unfamiliar man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit looked at Tina's pale face and her slightly trembling hand, and suddenly understood something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "She's my friend, I've been looking for her!" Kit spoke to the villagers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What? Just because you say she's your friend, she's your friend? This woman was saved by Drogo and is Drogo's wife!" the villagers shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Obviously, if Kit didn't hand Tina over, they would take direct action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The other side had the advantage in numbers, and if they really started a fight, Kit would have no chance of winning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina's face became even more grim, but Kit remained calm and said, "Since my friend was saved by Drogo, I can offer Drogo's family a compensation of 100,000!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As soon as they heard the number 100,000, the expressions of the villagers changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, 100,000 was a huge sum of money in this remote village. With this money, one could marry several wives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Drogo also came over. When he found out that Kit was willing to pay 100,000, his eyes flickered and he said, "Alright, give me the money now. No money, no leaving!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay! I can transfer the money to you through my phone!" Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The village was backward, and not everyone had a phone. As for mobile transfers, even fewer people would use this function.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, the village chief's phone had the transfer function activated. So, with the unanimous agreement of the villagers, the village chief helped Drogo's family receive the money first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit transferred 100,000 on the spot to the village chief's account. After the village chief confirmed it, Drogo finally agreed to release Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, at this moment, some of the villagers greedily stared at Kit, as if they were looking at a fat sheep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Naturally, Kit immediately noticed their intentions. "I came here after confirming with my friend. Before getting off the car, I sent my location to my friend. If something happens to me here, or if I don't meet up with my friend within an hour, my friend will immediately call the police."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he said that, the few villagers who had been eyeing him changed their expressions instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The village chief's face darkened as he said to those villagers, "Enough, let him go! Don't mess things up!"</p></div>
