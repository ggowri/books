        <h1>Chapter 1308</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he turned to look at Grace. &ldquo;Let's go back to the private room. The food's getting cold."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Grace. Then, as if reminded of something else, she said, "By the way, I just called the police. Some people here were slandering and insulting me. The police should be here in a minute.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then let Huang Qian stay here and deal with it," said Jason. The Huang Qian he mentioned was the female bodyguard who followed Grace around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded and turned to follow Jason to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean finally got up awkwardly from the ground and looked at Grace and Jason with some discomfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman he had abandoned like a useless pawn was now married to a much better man. It felt like a slap in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he could not lose his temper! He could only swallow it resentfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily was a little stunned. The man her older sister once loved deeply did not even shed a tear at her funeral. His face was even indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, she could never have imagined that this man would one day be so gentle to a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That woman was even Grace, Sean's ex-girlfriend! The thought added to her jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace's hand and walked out of the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stopped dead in his tracks and glanced down at the hand with slightly deformed joints in his hand. Then, he turned to look at Lily. "By the way, the Atkinson family had taken good care of my wife when she was in prison. You seemed to have wanted to cripple my wife's hands, didn&rsquo;t you, Second Miss Atkinson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily's face instantly turned pale, and she began to tremble with fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's black eyes glanced coldly at Lily before he left while holding Grace's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily almost collapsed to the ground. She knew that what Jason said was alluding to what she had done to Grace back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Jason going to get back at me for Grace for everything that I&rsquo;ve done against her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sean, what... What should we do? Jason is going to retaliate against me and the Atkinson family for Grace!" Lily said in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean was at loose ends too! In the past, the Stevens family had been afraid that the Reed family would retaliate against them, so he quickly broke up with Grace. However, who would have thought that Jason would retaliate against the Atkinson family and even the Stevens family for Grace? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, the other people in the private room finally realized that the man was Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace... married Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's Jason? Unbelievable!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did Jason marry a woman who had been to prison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace could now walk everywhere in Emerald City with her nose in the sky. Who would dare to mess with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So Sean and Lily..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, the people in the private room who had been so eager to please Sean and Lily could not wait to get away from them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyone could see that the Stevens family and the Atkinson family would probably be in turmoil soon.</p></div>
