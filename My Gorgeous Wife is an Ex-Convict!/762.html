        <h1>Chapter 761</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been looking for her, yet she had forgotten him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at the man who was carrying her on his back, her eyes watering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like what he said back then. He would carry her on his back if she got hurt, but... They would not have a lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The one she liked and loved was not him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, I won't come to this hill again. In fact, what happened when you were little is just something that happened when you were little. You don't have to be so obsessed with it," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want him to be obsessed with the incident during their childhood. She did not want him to be deceived by Stella, but now, from her standpoint, she could not explain everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian sneered, "Grace, who are you to tell me this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard that you seem to have a problem with Stella. Does it bother you that she&rsquo;s the one who saved my life?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew he had misunderstood her. "I just don't want you to be fooled," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fooled? Do you think your cousin is capable of fooling me?" There was confidence in Brian's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she was only an average woman from a small town with only a high school degree. She did not even have much experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was the young master of the Hart familyHart family who had met a lot of people and was the crown prince of the entertainment industry. He could easily find out her experiences from childhood to adulthood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could an uneducated woman without a strong family background fool him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew it was useless for her to say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had contributed to the situation herself. Speaking of which, she was lying to him too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me down. I can walk myself!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not stop. "If you really want to walk down the mountain like this, I'm afraid you'll have to walk until it's dark. I have no time to accompany you till dark."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you can go down the hill by yourself. I'll just walk down the hill slowly," she said. She knew the way down anyway. She could walk down alone. It was just that she would be a little slower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't abandon you. Even if it wasn't you and it was any other stranger on this hill today, I wouldn't abandon them and leave by myself, so you don't have to distance yourself from me," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. As far as she was concerned, Brian was not some warm-hearted person. You could even call him a cold person. She had seen the way his ex-girlfriend begged him before, but he was so cold that he did not have any residual affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could such a man say that he would not abandon a stranger and leave on his own?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if sensing her confusion, he continued saying, "If this were anywhere else, I would&rsquo;ve left you without mercy. But just not here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was where the little girl saved him. She did not abandon him, so... He would not abandon anybody here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the ordinary hill had become a holy place in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Strangely enough, when he and Stella had bought the candied haws on a stick, Stella wanted to go to the mall in town with him, but he was not in the mood. He asked the driver to send Stella there while he came here alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not expect to meet Grace!</p></div>
