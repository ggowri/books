        <h1>Chapter 1297</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Subconsciously, she quickly lowered her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" he asked, somewhat puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No-Nothing..." For some reason, she began to feel even hotter than when she was soaking her feet in the decoction. Even her face began to burn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Frowning slightly, he carried her to the bed and put her on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uhh... I'm going to sleep now," she said quickly, trying to calm her heart that was beating so fast just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could lift the covers, he leaned over with one hand propped at her side. The other was clasping her chin so that she was facing him. "Why won't you look at me all of a sudden? Did I say or do something to upset you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blinked. 'Uh, why would he think that way? Did he... misunderstand something?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If not, then why did you suddenly stop looking at me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Alright, it looks like he has misunderstood something.' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... Well... It's just..." Her voice faltered, and her face grew hotter and hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just?" He narrowed his eyes, and his handsome face moved closer to hers. "It's just what?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the handsome face that was enlarged before her, only feeling as if her willpower was being tested again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His long black eyelashes were like fans. Few men's eyelashes were as beautiful as his, and her face&mdash;now looking a little dull&mdash;was reflected in those inky eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His high nose bridge, sexy thin lips, defined jawline, and even his Adam's apple were so delicate. It seemed there was nothing about him that was not attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, tell me. It's just what?" The magnetic voice struck deep into her heart through her eardrums.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just... I want to, but I can't!" she blurted it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Grace's face immediately went red after she said it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was several times hotter than before! It was almost like it was going to burn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wanted to bury herself. 'Gosh. What did I just say?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason seemed to be stunned. His black eyes stared straight at her rosy cheeks. After a while, he seemed to come back to his senses and said to her, "You want to, but you can't?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gentle and intoxicating voice seemed to give off a bone-crushing charisma, making her feel like she was about to be intoxicated just by hearing him speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked embarrassed. Her almond-shaped eyes had a touch of shyness in them as if she were annoyed and coquettish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you want me, but you can't have me?" His breath smelled good, and the warmness sprayed on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Just forget what I said. I... I'm going to bed..." she said hurriedly, wishing she could get under the covers now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand was about to reach for the covers, but he intercepted and brought her hand to his cheek. His cheek now rested against the palm of her hand. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You already said it, how can you go back on it?" He smiled faintly, looking so charming. His peach blossom eyes looked so bright and charming under the lamplight. It was like the most beautiful lakes and mountains, captivating people's souls.</p></div>
