        <h1>Chapter 2486</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory suddenly gasped. Even if Amber Mitchell did not continue, he could figure it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She had someone cut off my finger. She flushed it and the ring down the toilet. She said, 'Amber Mitchell, you'll never get to wear another wedding ring!'" The smile on her lips grew wider, while her eyes were full of sarcasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory suddenly felt a severe tightness in his chest. 'So, that's... how she lost her finger!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had no idea about it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to be full of anger and guilt. He was mad that Louise Mitchell would do such a thing to her biological sister, and he felt guilty as he could have saved her back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would have found something if he had investigated carefully. However, he deliberately told people around him not to mention her in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though he hated her for betraying him and for making him the laughing stock of tMason Swansonty, he had never intended for her to end up like that. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell put her hand in front of George Gregory as if to make him see it more clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you still think I should tell everyone that I'm mentally ill and brought this upon myself? Do you think the Mitchell family didn't do me wrong, and my good sister spared no effort to find a doctor to treat my illness before I finally recovered?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory could not speak a word. Her right hand seemed a hundred or even a thousand times more glaring than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory, I don't want money. All I want is justice! I want justice even if I have to break my bones for it!" Amber Mitchell said every word with great ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could hardly take his eyes off of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He recalled her saying to him with a smile, &ldquo;George Gregory, I don't want money. I just want to be together forever. Can you do that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had replied to her without hesitation back then, "Yes. Amber Mitchell, I&rsquo;ll never marry anyone but you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had broken his word in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted them to be together forever, but he failed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she was going to get justice for herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was talking with her mother on the phone. "Mom, don't worry. George has promised to help the Mitchell family. After all, he doesn't want Simon to have an ex-convict as his mother. Amber Mitchell can't make a scene if George is willing to do something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Amber Mitchell seems to have the Reed family from Emerald City helping her," Mrs. Mitchell said anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Reed family is only powerful in Emerald City. They have no say in Deer City," said Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, there was suddenly a bang. Someone kicked the door open and barged into the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was about to lose her temper but froze when she saw George Gregory looking sullen. "George, what happened to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you cut off Amber Mitchell's finger because she was wearing the diamond ring I gave her for our wedding?" George Gregory asked sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I..." Louise Mitchell was astounded, not expecting George Gregory to ask her that. "George, did Amber Mitchell tell you some nonsense? She lost her finger when she self-harmed. It has nothing to do with me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It has nothing to do with you?" George Gregory's expression was frigid. "Say to my face again that it has nothing to do with you."</p></div>
