        <h1>Chapter 2765</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hesitated, not wanting to expose him to this embarrassing matter. It would make her feel more inferior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to see her concern and said, "You don't have to say it if you don&rsquo;t want to. But I hope you can tell me if you're in any trouble. Don't forget that you have a boyfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you." Valda Theller was relieved. Then, she changed the topic and said, "By the way, will you go shopping with me later? Camille's birthday is coming soon. I want to buy her a gift. Help me pick one out later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Brian said without any objection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them reached the shopping mall. Valda Theller looked at the clothes, cosmetics, and shoes in the shopping mall... For a moment, she had no idea what to get for Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What does your friend like?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was speechless. "She&rsquo;s a fangirl. She&rsquo;s been fangirling over Neil for two years. She's an avid fan of Neil. She bought a lot of Neil's merchandise. She even bought a necklace from a jewelry brand endorsed by Neil."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Neil?" Brian seemed to be thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, yes." Valda Theller's eyes suddenly lit up. "Neil seems to be one of your artists. Why don't you help me get Neil's signature? She&rsquo;ll be happy to get Neil's autograph for her birthday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's easy," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In that case, why don't I buy her something that Neil endorsed? But she buys everything except for limited edition and hard-to-get ones."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller felt troubled as she thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's buy something limited edition, then," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not that easy. Those limited edition ones are either reserved or already sold out. It&rsquo;ll be expensive even if we buy second-hand ones!" said Valda Theller as she gave an example. "It's just like the jewelry brand Neil endorsed. The cross-lock necklace Neil wore on his poster is a limited edition. Even if it's available in stores, only VIP customers can buy it. Ordinary customers can only buy another similar model."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille could only choose the next best thing and buy a similar model.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said the brand name, and Brian recognized it. He took her hand and said, "Come on. Let's go to the boutique."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" she asked blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're going there to buy the limited-edition necklace," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you a VIP member?" she asked in confusion. However, the brand was only an entry-level luxury brand. Besides, their target customers were young office ladies. It was not a brand Brian would patronize. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't. But as you said, Neil is an artist of my company, so it's not difficult for me to get VIP limited edition items that he endorses," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will it be too much trouble for you?" she asked. Although Camille would be delighted if she bought her the limited-edition necklace, she did not want to cause him too much trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's a piece of cake. Come on," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled brightly. "I'm just gonna put it out there. I'll pay for Camille's gift. You can't help me pay for it."</p></div>
