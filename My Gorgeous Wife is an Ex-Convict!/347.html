        <h1>Chapter 346</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never said these words before, but as he looked at her standing before his father's spirit tablet, he just naturally said it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he could only get the words out of his heart when he was facing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Speaking of which, my father must have seen a lot of women in his day, and there must have been some prettier ones. What a fool he was to give up everything for a woman like that," muttered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your father did not necessarily like your mother because she was pretty. Sometimes looks are not that important when a person likes another person. Besides, they'll like them whether they&rsquo;re good or bad," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes flickered slightly, and his gaze settled firmly on Grace's face. "Maybe&hellip; it's just like you said. Sometimes looks are not that important when a person likes another person&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like how he liked her. He had seen women who were more beautiful, more understanding of a man's heart, and more accommodating than her. However, he just liked the feeling she gave him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He liked the calm warmth when she was concerned about him. He liked her to call him &lsquo;Jay&rsquo; over and over again. He liked her to hold his hand to sleep at night...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His glance seemed to imply something, almost enveloping her whole being. She seemed unable to move under his eyes...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not until the incense Grace lit for Jason's father had finished burning that Jason got up and set the photo of his mother on fire. Then, he blew out the candle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you burn the photo of your mother?" she asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I burn the photo every year at this time," said Jason. "All right, let's go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned and looked at the time. It was just after midnight&mdash;it was a new day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why burn the photo at this time of year?" she asked, finding it strange. Then, as if aware of something, she hastened to say, "Uh, you don't have to answer that. It was just a... casual question."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She should be thinking of distancing herself from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yesterday was her birthday. My father would wait for her to celebrate her birthday together at this time of year, no matter how late it was. I burn her photo to let him know that one day I'll find her and take her to his grave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason muttered. It was why every year tonight, he would look at a photo of the woman he was supposed to call his mother. It was to remind him not to forget what she looked like and not to fail to recognize her someday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come on," he said as he took her hand. Then, they left the mourning hall and headed toward the main house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the security room, several security guards who were keeping watch at night gathered in front of the surveillance screen, looking at the two people who just left the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They're out. Oh my God, Miss Cummins is safe and sound!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Reed is... He&rsquo;s holding her hand!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's the only one who can go into the memorial hall and come out holding hands with Young Master Reed. If it were someone else, she would have been killed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The security guards chattered, and suddenly, the man on the surveillance screen looked up in the direction of the surveillance camera. It was as if he were looking across the screen at the people watching the surveillance screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, the security guards kept quiet and dared not say anything more.</p></div>
