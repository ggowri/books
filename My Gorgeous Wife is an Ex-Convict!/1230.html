        <h1>Chapter 1229</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She scoffed. "How can that be? If Jason has gotten married, the whole of Emerald City is probably going to explode."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If not, why was your account suspended? Besides... the staff at tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau surrounded him when he was doing the registration process!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reporter friend immediately kept quiet. After a long pause, she finally said in a trembling voice, "If it was really Jason... it&rsquo;ll be all over Emerald City's headlines."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, unless Jason himself published such news, no media dared to report it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Also, who the hell was the woman marrying Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The entertainment reporter fell into deep curiosity as she stared at the photo on her phone that got her account suspended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman the reporter was curious about was now sitting in the car as she looked at the receding landscape on both sides. She asked, "Where are we going now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "To the hospital. I've made all the arrangements for you at the hospital. When we get there, you and the baby can get some necessary tests done. The doctor only gave you the preliminary tests when you were unconscious.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought about it and agreed it was indeed necessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because her womb was severely injured and her periods were always inconsistent. The longest time she missed her period before this was more than four months, so that was why she did not think much about missing her period for three months this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she never thought that she missed her period this time because she was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, she had never performed any early tests on the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lowering her head, Grace looked at her still flat stomach. She had always been thin, and she had eaten less these days, which made her even thinner now. Her pregnant belly was not even visible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She regretted it a little. She was afraid that the baby in her belly would not develop well because she had not paid attention to her nutrition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason leaned back in the chair. He kept looking at Grace with gentleness and longing in his eyes that he himself did not even notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they arrived at the hospital, gynecology and obstetrics experts were already waiting there. As soon as they saw Jason coming, they immediately greeted him with a shower of greetings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason only said to the experts, "The baby in my wife's belly is important. I'll do whatever it takes to keep it and ensure its smooth birth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The experts were shocked when they heard the word &lsquo;wife&rsquo;, but what they were most concerned about was their work. Therefore, they quickly swallowed their shock. One of the leading experts said awkwardly, "Well... We still need to look at the ultrasound first. After all, she's carrying three babies, and the previous ultrasound report showed that Mrs. Reed's womb is injured..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason did not hear what the expert said next. He was shocked&mdash;even more shocked than when he first knew Grace was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Triplets?" The cold, melodious voice went straight out of tune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, triplets," the expert answered. Looking at Jason's startled expression, he asked carefully, "It was written in the report from the previous hospital you asked your secretary to submit to us. Didn&rsquo;t you... know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was rendered speechless. Hearing this, Jason only felt a lump in his throat. He immediately turned his head and glared at Terrence who was standing behind him. "Did the report say triplets?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence quickly replied, "Yeah. I took a picture of the report and emailed it to you yesterday. Master Reed, you... must&rsquo;ve been too busy to check it."</p></div>
