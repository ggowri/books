        <h1>Chapter 3111</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda twisted her wrist and pulled her hand out of Brian's fingers. "I...I'm a bit hungry and I want to order some takeout. Do you want to eat with me? But I'm not sure if they deliver to the hospital at this late hour."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to eat, you will definitely be able to eat," Brian said confidently. "What do you want to eat? Let me help you get it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, after half an hour, a light and suitable dinner for patients was placed on the small table next to Valda's bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was eating and then looked at Brian beside her, "Aren't you going to eat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not too hungry, you go ahead and eat," he said. It seemed that just watching her eat now gave him an indescribable sense of satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Would you like to try one?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes flickered slightly, "Okay." Saying that, he leaned over, brought his face close to her hand, and slightly parted his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was taken aback by his posture. Could it be that he wanted her to... feed him?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What, don't you want me to have a taste?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Or, would you like to pick it up yourself?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just have a shrimp dumpling, no need to bring out another pair of fork," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She suddenly didn't know what to say, so she could only pick up a shrimp dumpling with her fork and put it to her lips."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took a bite of the shrimp dumpling, but held her hand that was holding the fork. It was as if they were holding the fork together, feeding him the entire shrimp dumpling one bite at a time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the process of eating the shrimp dumpling, his pair of phoenix eyes stared straight at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they finished the shrimp dumpling, Valda's face turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It really is delicious," Brian whispered, licking his lips with his tongue, his phoenix eyes showing a strange look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face turned even redder, his gaze seemed to be filled with desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I'm full, I want to sleep a little more," she said, putting down her utensils, wiping her lips with a tissue, and then lying back on the bed, closing her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she continued to look at him, she was afraid that her determination would waver, and she would want to be with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her recent injury had actually made her see reality more clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For her, a person with a disabled leg, things that seemed simple to others were no longer simple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When others saw her limping, they would look at her with strange eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And those mocking, those contemptuous... How could she let Brian bear it with her?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was so good, so perfect, she didn't want him to become the subject of criticism because of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, even if she closes her eyes, she can feel his gaze as if it's always fixed on her face, so intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't know how long had passed when she heard a faint sigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is he sighing... because of her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda suddenly felt a strange sourness in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And how could Brian not see that the person in front of him was pretending to be asleep?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyelashes were trembling lightly, revealing her current nervousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just since she doesn't want to face him, he also doesn't want to expose her avoidance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, do you know? On the day of the accident, when I saw you fall into the water, I completely broke down. In that moment, everything in front of me felt dark and colorless, as if the world had lost its vibrancy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sat by her bedside and gently spoke, saying all the things he wanted to say to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At that moment, I finally realized that I had fallen in love with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, he lifted his hand and gently stroked her slightly messy hair. Then, he gently took her right hand and placed his lips on the back of her hand. "My obsession with Grace has lasted for years. It's a deep obsession, and the pain is also deep. I thought I could never get out of that abyss of pain in my life, but... it was you who reached out your hand. It was you who repeatedly told me that you would try to make me fall in love with you. And then, unconsciously, my pain seemed to decrease and my happiness increased. And all of this was given to me by you."</p></div>
