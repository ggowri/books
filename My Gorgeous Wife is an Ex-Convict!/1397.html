        <h1>Chapter 1396</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not want to apologize anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she did apologize, she would be admitting that she had deliberately pushed Paisley Daniels and was indeed malevolent. In that case, Nelson would not be able to hold his head up high!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her silence made him a little uncomfortable. He knew he should withdraw his hand and not touch the woman again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his hand seemed a little reluctant. It was as if it was attached to her slightly cool cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her cheeks were sunken, and her skin was no longer as fair and smooth as it once was because of the exposure to the weather. She looked sallow and almost malnourished now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she still had her pretty and elegant facial features. She had arched eyebrows and a delicate nose. Her slightly curled eyelashes were even more obvious when she closed her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment, she was as quiet as a doll. He could not help looking at her. It was not until the car stopped in front of the hospital that he suddenly came to his senses and withdrew his hand as if it were burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't apologize," Kyla Corbyn suddenly said as he opened the car door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not your call!" Martin Weiss forcefully pulled her out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla Corbyn was forcefully taken to Paisley Daniels's ward by Martin Weiss, the Daniels family was there. Paisley Daniels was on the hospital bed, drinking the tonic Mrs. Daniels was serving her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin, why have you brought her here?" asked Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I told you, I'll give you and the Daniels family an explanation," said Martin Weiss. Then, he snapped at Kyla Corbyn, "Apologize! If you don't want to go to prison again, give a proper apology to Paisley and the Daniels family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked coldly at the people in the room and said calmly, "I told you I won't apologize!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels could not help frowning while Martin Weiss said in exasperation, "Do you really want Nelson to visit you in prison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;If he's going to visit me in prison, then he'll know I've been wronged!" replied Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." He glared at her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Daniels said, "I don't think it's necessary if she's just going to say she's sorry. Although she's Nelson's mother, Paisley's baby is gone. It's not something an apology can solve!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How do you think this should end?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She caused Paisley to lose her baby, so let her kneel in front of Paisley and grovel. That's what you call an apology," said Mr. Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay!" replied Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn sneered and said, "You decided on that yourselves. I never agreed to it! I won't kneel in front of Paisley Daniels, let alone grovel. You can find a lawyer to sue me and we can see how the judge rules!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she turned to walk out of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss's men stopped Kyla Corbyn. Martin Weiss gave them a look and the two men immediately grabbed Kyla Corbyn's arms. They pulled Kyla Corbyn back to the bedside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me go! What are you going to do?" Kyla Corbyn struggled but could not break the grip of the two burly men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you still refusing to admit your mistakes?" asked Martin Weiss as he glared at Kyla Corbyn.</p></div>
