        <h1>Chapter 4298 Confirming Something</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina stared at Chandler intently, "A meal, will you agree?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, Chandler finally said, "Okay, wait a while, wait for me to finish work. You can wait here or outside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll wait here," she said, taking the initiative to sit on the nearby sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler didn't say anything more, he walked back to his desk and sat down, resuming his work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina sat on the sofa and took out her phone. On the surface, she looked like she was checking her phone, but in reality, she was secretly watching Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably wouldn't have thought that she was so nervous just now, afraid that even for this meal, he would refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way Chandler treats her now is different from before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since signing the divorce agreement, she could feel him constantly creating distance between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's as if he's deliberately trying to downplay her existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the divorce, this should have been expected, but strangely, it made her feel uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it because she really has feelings for Chandler?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or is it that even if she lost her memory and forgot about her past with Chandler, she still subconsciously loves him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> when they really separate, she feels lost, feels uncomfortable, and thinks of him more and more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when she sees him tormented by the curse, she feels sorry for him, and she would be willing to have another child with him to break the curse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Tina was lost in thought, Chandler's voice suddenly sounded, "Have you seen enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Tina was taken aback, only then did she realize that she had been lost in thought, and was caught red-handed peeking at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've seen enough," she said in embarrassment, quickly lowering her head to look at the pages on her phone, trying to ease the awkwardness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler didn't say anything more, he continued reviewing the documents in his hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he finished reviewing all the documents, he stood up and said, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it's not time to get off work yet," she said, there was still half an hour before she got off work!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay, let's finish dinner early so we can each go home earlier," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Tina felt a sudden pang in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him now, is having a meal with her already a task?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suppressing the sting in her heart, she smiled and said, "Sure, let's go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler drove and took Tina to a restaurant she used to love before her memory loss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the two entered, the waiter came up to them, obviously recognizing them, "Mr. Hunter, Miss Stephenson, good evening, please follow me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The waiter led them to a window seat. From this position, they could overlook a panoramic view of the neon-lit night, which was beautiful and spectacular.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for the current scenery, she did feel a sense of familiarity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did I often sit in this seat before?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm," Chandler responded, instructing the waiter to give the menu to Tina first. "You go ahead and order, I'll add on later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need," Tina said. "You order, just like how you used to order based on my preferences. I want to know if I still like what I used to like."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at her in confusion but didn't say anything. Instead, he ordered based on her past preferences.</span></p></div>
