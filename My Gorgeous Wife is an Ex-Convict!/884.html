        <h1>Chapter 883</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? What happened?" Jason asked lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's... about Miss Cummins."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace?" Jason's expression changed. "What happened to her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um&hellip; Well, today Miss Cummins's friend, Lina, went looking for Miss Cummins, and they went to an underground bar to watch a performance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Jason asked, "What's the matter? Did someone argue with them?" He was not worried about her getting hurt. After all, he had sent someone to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they could not even provide basic protection, they were nothing more than trash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They didn't argue with anyone, but King's performing at the underground bar today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"King?" Jason raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's one of the hottest bar bands lately. Their performances are&hellip; Um... They&rsquo;re popular with young women," Terrence&rsquo;s tone became softer and softer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes narrowed. "Go on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"King's performances&hellip; include a lot of dancing, and some of the dancing... makes women go crazy. For example... taking off... their clothes..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more Terrence spoke, the more frightened he became. When he said the words &lsquo;take off their clothes&rsquo;, the president's expression immediately sank. He instantly knew that trouble was coming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The air in the study seemed to freeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Jason got up and asked coldly, "Where is this underground bar?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Huh?' Terrence was stunned. 'Uh... Master Reed isn't planning to go there himself, is he?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Grace and Lina were sipping on their beer as they watched the performance in the underground bar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Women were screaming around. Many of them were waving their fluorescent sticks and signs like they were in a mini-concert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's really enjoyable like Lina said! It&rsquo;s as if those troubles will go away when you're immersed in this crazy environment.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took another sip of her beer as she thought about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Lina excitedly pulled Grace and said, "Hey, it's about to start. Their hottest performance is about to start!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only saw the five handsome guys on the stage beginning to take off their coats. Then, they began to dance in unison on the stage while Lina stood on the chair and started to dance to the rhythm&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, jump! Let's jump together!" Lina said to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace laughed. Perhaps it was easy to let go of oneself in such an environment, so she said, "Alright!" Then, she started dancing with Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I should throw all my troubles aside. It'll be as if I&rsquo;ve never been to prison, never experienced pain, and especially not heartbreak. I'm still the Grace who is driven and has endless dreams!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two women continued to dance to the intense music. Meanwhile, a luxury car had now pulled up to the entrance of the underground bar.</p></div>
