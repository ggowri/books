        <h1>Chapter 306</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're Grace." What Hadwin said was not a question, but an affirmation. After he happened to see Lina in the street that day, he began to scout out everything about Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, among the materials he found was this Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was Lina's best friend. It was also because Lina had to help Grace with her lawsuit that Lina suddenly took the earliest flight back home from abroad. She went to great lengths to help Grace find lawyers and all kinds of evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, it was also because of Grace that Lina left him so quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin's heart was strangely uncomfortable when he thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Grace was not a woman, Hadwin might have treated her as a rival.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I am," Grace said, raising her chin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have no right to meddle in the affairs between Lina and me. You'd better not overrate yourself in some matters. I show no mercy to women," Hadwin said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was anxious. "Hadwin, this is between you and me. Don't get my friend involved!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the more anxious she was, the more Hadwin found the scene before him irritating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Jason finally lazily said, "I don't care what happens between you and Lina, but you can't touch Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin turned to Jason with a slightly surprised look in his eyes. "I didn't expect Young Master Reed to visit me so late at night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What surprised him was the relationship between Jason and Grace. He had checked Grace and found out about Grace's case. It was Grace who ran over and killed Jason's fianc&eacute;e, Jennifer Atkinson. However, it was now clear to everyone that Grace and Jason had an unusual relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm taking Lina with me tonight," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin frowned and sneered. "Didn't you just say that you don't care about what happens between Lina and me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't mind after tonight, but right now, I'm taking her with me," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men looked at each other, and there seemed to be some tension in the air. It made the people watching breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Lina could not help but stare at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I disagree, are you going to take her by force?" Hadwin asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I do have this in mind," Jason replied with an air of confidence as if taking Lina away from his turf was nothing difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin's eyes gradually darkened. Although it was only a short time since he took over the Stephenson family, he was well aware of Jason's social status in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned around to look at Lina and asked, "Do you want to leave?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned. She stared at the man she had not seen for more than three years and hesitated for a moment before saying, "I want to leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin pursed his thin lips. "You are as heartless as ever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." She tried to argue, but the look in his eyes made her feel like something was stuck in her throat. The pain in her heart also seemed to come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason then left Hadwin's house with Grace and Lina. Hadwin told the subordinate who had brought them in, "Get out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he responded.</p></div>
