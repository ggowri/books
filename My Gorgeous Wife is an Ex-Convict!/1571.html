        <h1>Chapter 1569</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," answered Lina. When Anthony Sherman went to the parking lot, she stood on the side of the road. The night wind made her a little uncomfortable. She suddenly ran to the trash can nearby and threw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She threw up for a long time before she was almost done. <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>Dazed, she tried to reach into her bag for a tissue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she could not find it anywhere even after rummaging for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, a hand holding a handkerchief appeared in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Thank... you." Lina said her thanks with a drunken slur. Without thinking much, she took the handkerchief and wiped the corners of her mouth. She only realized that it was a handkerchief and not a tissue when she was done wiping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why... Why don't I give it back to you after I wash it&hellip;?" she asked as she looked up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She thought it was Anthony Sherman who handed her the handkerchief, but only then did she realize it was not!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What she saw was a face that was once so familiar to her. She had seen it in her dreams from time to time over the past five years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It had been five years. Her memory of his face was from five years ago. She only saw what he looked like now after searching for his news today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked at the man in front of her who was in a suit and tie. He had his hair slicked back, revealing his full forehead. It made his beautiful face look more defined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The years had been kind to him that she hardly saw any traces of age in him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her hiccups broke the silence. "Long... Long time no see..." She had meant to say it in a calm tone but was tongue-tied after drinking wine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You drank too much," he said as he narrowed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I did drink a bit too much." She tried to open her eyes wide as if trying to get a better look at the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is that man just now... your boyfriend?" Hadwin Stephenson asked after a moment's hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Boyfriend?" Lina suddenly chuckled. As she was drunk, her chuckle sounded a little silly. "I&rsquo;m on a... blind date, but he's pretty nice. Although... we just met for the first time today, we... hit it off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina stammered as she slowly got up, looking at him in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had tried so hard to get over him, so why was he showing up in front of her and destroying her peace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You met this man for the first time today? Do you have any idea how dangerous it is to get drunk in front of a man you met for the first time?" Hadwin Stephenson said somewhat angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was mad that she got drunk easily in front of another man. He was even madder that she... seemed to have affections for that man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina murmured, "Dangerous? No, he's a good man, and I'll be fine. Hadwin Stephenson, I... I've gotten over you, so don't worry. Even if you&rsquo;re in... Emerald City, I won't bother you. I won't... I won't ruin your relationship with your girlfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's face was cold. Each word she said stung him like a needle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had come to Emerald City and drove near her office, hoping to get a glimpse of her from afar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He told himself that he would only take a glimpse. He only wanted a glimpse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he followed her to the downtown plaza in his car and watched her enter a restaurant with a man. Then, he could not help appearing in front of her when he saw her throwing up due to her drunken state.</p></div>
