        <h1>Chapter 2076</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss almost left in a fluster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper looked apologetic as he said, "I'm sorry to make you and Mr. Weiss..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm the one who should apologize for getting you involved with him and me." Kyla smiled bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although Chase Harper repeatedly said it was nothing, Kyla still felt sorry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At night, Nelson and her mother were already asleep. Kyla was about to close the store's shutters when a car pulled at the entrance. Then, a figure staggered out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before Kyla could react, the figure embraced her, looked down, and buried his face in her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla..." The hoarse voice mixed with the smell of alcohol told her who it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is Martin Weiss... drunk?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla wanted to push Martin Weiss away, but the more she pushed him, the tighter he held her. Their bodies were pressed against each other, and his scent enveloped her whole body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, are you drunk?" Kyla shouted in a low whisper, afraid the noise would wake her mother and Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Drunk?" Martin Weiss suddenly chuckled. His chuckle was husky and low as he burped. "Yeah, I... I'm drunk. I... I only dare to come over after... drinking so much wine..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was afraid he would see the hatred in her eyes if he was sober.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Would he not sense her looking at him with hatred if he was drunk?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, do you know how much I miss you? Every time I see you, I try so hard to control myself..." he murmured as he buried his face in her shoulder while his lips kissed her neck longingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla trembled. "Let me go..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How could I let you go? How is that possible?" He kissed her harder. "Kyla, I love you... I can't let you go..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But Martin Weiss, I... I don't love you..." Kyla struggled to speak, feeling suffocated from the embrace. His arms were like rebars, holding her motionless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stiffened, then kissed her harder than ever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, don't... If you don't stop, I'll..." Before she could finish, he suddenly lay motionless on her shoulder, and the force that had held her down disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla pushed hard, and Martin Weiss just fell to the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She gasped in shock, feeling a burn on her cheek and neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not move after falling to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She looked at him in doubt. Moments later, she squatted down to check on him and realized that he must have... passed out drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was instantly caught in a dilemma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It seemed inappropriate to leave him lying here, but it seemed worse to bring him inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She hesitated, helped him up with some difficulty, and put him into the car he had driven over. Then, he asked, "Where are you staying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes were closed. He was a drunken mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla sighed, got into the driver's seat, started the car, and drove toward a nearby hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It seemed that she could only find a hotel for Martin Weiss to stay in tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car pulled up at the entrance of an ordinary hotel in tMason Swansonty, which was no match for those upscale hotels Martin Weiss usually stayed in. Fortunately, it was still decent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla parked the car, searched Martin Weiss's body, and found his wallet. Sure enough, his ID was in his wallet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She helped Martin Weiss up and walked to the hotel&rsquo;s reception desk with some difficulty. After checking in, she then helped him into the hotel room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The room was small. It was a single room with a bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla put Martin Weiss to bed and took a few breaths before raising her hand to wipe off the sweat from his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a moment's hesitation, Kyla bent over to help Martin Weiss remove his shoes. Then, she took out his suit jacket and covered him with the hotel blanket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla... Kyla..." He kept muttering her name, and sweat began to drip from his forehead. His straight brows furrowed as if he was having a nightmare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla pressed her lips together and straightened up to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, one of his hands reached out from under the covers and caught her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze. She saw Martin Weiss open his eyes and stare at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let go. I want to go home!" Kyla twisted her wrist, trying to break free from his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next moment, with a spin, Kyla fell onto the bed while Martin Weiss's body pressed against hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, what are you trying to do?" She felt flustered. This position made her uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What... I'm trying to do?" he murmured as his face moved closer and closer to hers, the tip of his nose taking in her scent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The scent calmed his flustered heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, don't leave me. Don't... go anywhere, okay..." he said as the tip of his nose rubbed her cheek gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The gesture was so intimate, just like when they were dating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla had goosebumps. "Martin Weiss, I don't care if you're drunk or whatever. Let... Let go of me. We'll talk when you wake up tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All she wanted now was to get away. An instinctive sense of crisis seemed to warn her that something she regretted might happen if she stayed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He suddenly smiled, but it was a sad smile. "You're going to that... man named Chase Harper again if I let you go, aren't you? I... don't want you to go to him. What... What's so good about him that you would look at me with such hatred in your eyes? Why... Why would you defend him so much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm not going to Chase Harper. I'm just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The words &lsquo;Chase Harper&rsquo; seemed to trigger him suddenly. His expression instantly changed, and he said, "You're not allowed to mention Chase Harper anymore. Would you come back to me if I ruin him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's heart sank. She glared at Martin Weiss. "Don't do anything to Chase Harper. I told you, he has nothing to do with us!"</p></div>
