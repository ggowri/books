        <h1>Chapter 3300</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right," said Jason. "You can only share your innermost thoughts with someone you trust deeply. It's not something you can just say to anyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This incident was a lesson for my daughter. Although it was a bit painful, it may be beneficial for her in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper listened as Lawrence, looking pitiful, begged her not to leave once again, bringing to mind the previous time she had tried to go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why is he making such a face?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he took advantage of her, that would be great!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She really likes his music and wants to be friends with him forever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Will she never hear his music again in the future? Her heart is still so sad... so sad...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The weather is getting colder and the days are getting closer to the Lunar New Year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The atmosphere of the New Year is becoming more and more intense around here, and Valda is also getting more and more bundled up like a ball.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although sometimes she feels that it's not necessary to wear so much, but her husband always looks like he's afraid she'll catch a cold, so she has no choice but to make herself look more and more like a ball.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She originally thought that she would be the one feeling tired during pregnancy, but now it seems like he is the one who is more exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Almost every day, he is very careful. During the day, he is busy with work, and in the evening, he has to come back and take care of her. When it comes to her prenatal check-up day, he has to work overtime to finish his work, so that he can have time to accompany her to the check-up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, in the middle of the night, she would wake up and find him busy working in his study. At those times, her heart would be filled with pity for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She has mentioned to him more than once that she could have her maid accompany her for prenatal check-ups, but he insists on being by her side for every single one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But even if we miss it once, it's not a big deal, right?" she said like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could it be nothing? It's important to me," he said. "Valda, do you know? I want to be with you to experience every special day. I don't want to have any regrets in my memories. Every time I accompany you for a prenatal check-up, I am participating in the growth of our child with you. Even if it's tiring, I will be very happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Happy?" She paused for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, I'm really happy. It gives me a sense of fulfillment because I have a wife who loves me deeply and whom I also love deeply. Plus, we're about to have a child. When I wait outside for you during your check-ups, I think to myself that I finally have a family and I'm going to be a dad soon. The feeling of becoming a father is becoming clearer and clearer to me. It's something I never dared to dream of before," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said in a strange tone, "Why didn't you dare to even think about it before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I thought I would never have my own children in this lifetime before falling in love with you," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remained silent, understanding the meaning behind his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He's just that kind of man! He doesn't even consider any alternatives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So in the future, we will have children, and not just one child..." she said to him like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wants to have children with him, many many children...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the middle of the night, Valda was awakened by a familiar cramp in her calf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It hurts!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She grimaced because she turned over and her calf cramped again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the later stages of pregnancy, the frequency of her leg cramps increased, and most of the time it happened while she was sleeping. Sometimes, an unintentional stretch or turn could trigger a leg cramp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, the pain from the cramp finally dissipated slowly.</p></div>
