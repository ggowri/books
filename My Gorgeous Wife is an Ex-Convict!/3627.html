        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She leaned against his chest and could faintly hear the rapid beating of his heart through his clothes, as if he was nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was he nervous?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of her words and actions?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her eyes, he always seemed so calm and composed, able to handle anything with ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he says he's "afraid".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, I like you. I think this kind of liking is no longer just childhood friendship, but something more between a man and a woman. When I heard from Meave that you were cornered at the school gate today, I knew that maybe by coming here, I would only make things more chaotic. But I couldn't help myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper spoke slowly, "At that time, I was thinking, I must really like you, care about you. This kind of liking, it must be love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice, so clear, flowed into his ears like a warm stream, gradually spreading throughout his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, I love you!" she said to him firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he felt his eyes welling up with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Drip! Drip!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper felt something fall onto her hair, and when she looked up, she saw two clear tears streaming down his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart filled with tenderness, she quickly lifted her hand to wipe away the tears from his face. "Why are you crying?" she said she loved him, hoping he would understand her feelings and be happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected him to cry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Come to think of it, how long has it been since she last saw him cry?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when he was bullied by others as a child, he wouldn't cry. Only when she got hurt because of him, he cried uncontrollably!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she felt that when he cried, it would make her feel really upset!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he cried again, and that same feeling of discomfort remains!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just happy," he murmured, "the person I love the most in my life is you - Jasper!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As his words fell, this time, he took the initiative to kiss her on the lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was young, he promised himself that he would definitely be with her in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, does it mean that the dream he once had is beginning to come true?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the darkness of the bamboo forest, this scene was captured by a pair of deep black eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...The commotion at the school gate gradually dissipated, and Stanford University returned to its former tranquility.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And a figure walked out of the gate of Stanford University, walking aimlessly on the streets.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger just walked like this, without a destination.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know where he wanted to go, all he knew was that he wanted to escape Stanford University because staying there made him feel suffocated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper had always known that he would eventually fall in love with William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, their feelings had developed over the past decade and it was no surprise that William had feelings for Jasper as well. The outcome was only natural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he actually saw it, he found the scene to be so dazzling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had thought that she just wanted to rush into the crowd and bring William into the campus. But he never expected that she would openly declare their relationship in front of so many people and on live camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing those people, the camera, and the questions, she showed no sign of retreat. She firmly held William's hand, while his heart started to ache, almost losing the strength to stand.</span></p></div>
