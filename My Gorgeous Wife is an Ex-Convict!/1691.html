        <h1>Chapter 1689</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">These photos would probably be proven to be photoshopped and no one would believe whatever Damian Harmon said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before long, the police and forensics personnel came. Jason's bodyguards handed all the scattered photos they had collected to the police. Then, the computer and photography experts also arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The crowd was stunned when they saw this. It was not just one or two experts but a group of them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Everyone with some fame was here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Only Jason could get so many experts to come. It would make sense if the Reed family had bribed one or two experts, but no one would believe that the Reed family could bribe so many people to lie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Damian Harmon was dumbfounded. He opened his mouth but did not know what to say all of a sudden!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">These people got busy, and the police asked Damian Harmon about the source of the photos. They also informed him of the laws he had broken by distributing them so wantonly today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The police's forensics personnel and Jason's experts laid out their tools to identify the photos on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch bit her red lip, knowing her plan with Damian Harmon was ruined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">While she was thinking about what to do next, the huge electronic screen in front of her suddenly turned black. Damian Harmon's voice sounded from the speakers connected to the screen...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Lynch, this isn&rsquo;t enough money. You&rsquo;re asking me to go and spread rumors that Grace is in an illicit relationship with her mentor but you&rsquo;re giving me so little money. It's too little!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as the voice was heard, all eyes were on Damian Harmon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Damian Harmon's face was pale with fear. 'What's... going on? I saved this recording on another phone that I don't use very often. Who... Who the hell found this recording and is playing it here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was paler than Damian Harmon. When she heard the recording, her heart gave a sudden jolt and her whole body went cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Damian Harmon recorded the phone call? He promised me everything would be done in secret and there would be no recordings of any of our calls, lest we get caught.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... this call... She did not record it, so it must be Damian Harmon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Once everything's done, you'll get everything you deserve." Irene Lynch's voice sounded from the speakers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But everyone online is siding with that damn lawyer. How are we going to get everything done?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Just start a rumor. Use photoshopped photos or something. When the rumors spread, so what if they prove that those photos were photoshopped afterward?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Won&rsquo;t... Won&rsquo;t I have to take the fall?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"All you have to do is say that someone left these photos on your doorstep. Just tell them you don't know who put them there and whether they're real or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch spoke in a breezy manner. However, the Irene Lynch at the present was on the verge of collapsing as cold sweat kept seeping from her forehead.</p></div>
