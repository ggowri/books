        <h1>Chapter 3920</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Mick!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned. She never expected to run into Mick at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Standing next to Mick was a bodyguard holding a large umbrella to shield Mick from the pouring rain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are you here?" Nancy murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I should be asking you that. Are you trying to get yourself killed?" Mick replied irritably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had been on his way back to the Reed House when he saw a figure walking in the middle of the road. Although the passing vehicles were avoiding her, it was still extremely dangerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Normally, he wouldn't have paid any attention to someone so reckless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her back view somehow seemed familiar to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until the car got closer that he finally recognized her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He immediately told the driver to stop the car, got out, and pulled her to safety!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even he himself didn't expect to act in such a way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mick... do you know that dying is actually very easy?" Nancy murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her dull eyes and drenched appearance made him frown, and her words made him feel uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he couldn't quite put his finger on why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, do you want to die?" he asked, staring at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Die?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Nancy's mind, she once again saw the image of her mother falling from the building, and the sight of her mother's body covered in a white sheet at the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the last conversation she had with her mother was an argument.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If... her mother hadn't tried to stop Clarissa, if her mother hadn't tried to help her... then her mother wouldn't have died!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... I don't want to die," she choked out. Her mother had risked her life to save hers, and she needed to cherish it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if she was the only one left in her life, she had to keep living!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as she was alive, there would still be someone in the world who remembered her mother, who would visit her grave on Qingming and Dongzhi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she died too, then who would remember her mother?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you don't want to die, then..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's words were cut off as Nancy suddenly hugged him around the waist, burying her face in his chest and bursting into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bodyguard holding the umbrella was startled and instinctively reached out to pull Nancy away from Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick raised his hand to stop the bodyguard's action and let Nancy cry on his shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she cried, sometimes gasping for air, he gently patted her back to help her breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy didn't know how long she had cried for until she came back to her senses and found herself in Mick's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where are we going?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll take you home first," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Home?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Where was she going? Back to the Schultz family or to her own narrow and cold rental room?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't want to go to either of them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't want to go back! Don't take me home. Just drop me off somewhere with more people," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, she didn't want to be alone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't want to be surrounded by that lonely and cold feeling, which would make her feel even more deeply that she had become an orphan, all alone in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick looked at Nancy and, after a moment of contemplation, told the driver an address.</p></div>
