        <h1>Chapter 1557</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">While she was wondering about it, the bathroom door suddenly opened and Jason walked out of the bathroom. He was slightly stunned when he saw Grace sitting in the chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He glanced at the tablet playing the video and said coldly, "I never allowed you to touch my things. Get out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace got up but did not walk out of the bedroom. Instead, she walked toward Jason. "Jay, there's nothing between Brian and me. Yes, I know he has feelings for me, but I've made it clear to him. You'll always be the one I love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the look on his face grew colder. "I don't want to know what's going on between you and him. I'm going to bed. Whatever it is, we'll talk about it tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Since seeing her and Brian at Reed Residence's entrance this afternoon, he had been inexplicably upset. Even he could not tell why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although he had lost all his memories of her, he more or less knew that there seemed to be history between her and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he had never cared about this history.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, she had only been a &lsquo;dead wife&rsquo; to him previously. Why should he care about what had happened between her and Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he did not expect her to appear before him so suddenly. It even made him seem to... care more and more about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The sight of her and Brian together would make him feel agitated and uneasy. Even his heart would contract strongly as a feeling he had never experienced before overcame his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I must explain it to you." Grace stared at Jason and said, "I know you've forgotten some things. Then I can tell you about them from the beginning. I met Brian in my grandmother's hometown when I was a child&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't want to hear it. What does it matter whether you explain it or not?" he said as he cut her short.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said right away, "I don't want you to misunderstand. Since you're investigating what happened between Brian and me, wouldn't it be better if I tell you myself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Perhaps what I&rsquo;ve investigated holds more truth than your words? It's the first time I've ever seen Brian treat a woman like this. Did you fall for him too when you watched the video just now?" The corners of his lips suddenly raised, and he looked at her with a half-smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, you're the only one I'm in love with," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm the only one?" He leaned forward suddenly, his handsome face approaching hers. "Then tell me why did you marry me. Was it because you love me? Was it because of the kids? Or... was it because Brian didn't help you pay for Lina&rsquo;s expensive medical bills, so you came to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned. "You found out about it? Do you remember?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't need to remember anything. I can find out about it just by doing a little research," he said with a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was silent. She did marry him for the children and Lina's medical bills, but... it was also because she had him in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had found out what her heart wanted after they married!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her silence only made him more annoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sure enough, she had not married him willingly! "Why did you stop explaining? It seems that I was right then. You only married me because of the children and Lina!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It seems you won't believe anything I say." After all, he had no memory of the past. His knowledge was only based on the information he got from investigating. The more they continued to talk about it, the messier it would get. "Get a good rest and calm down. We'll talk about it once you&rsquo;ve calmed down."</p></div>
