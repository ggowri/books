        <h1>Chapter 2691</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, nothing would come out of it even if the lawyer tried to pull some strings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack looked confused. 'I... I&rsquo;ve never offended the Hart family. Even if I did instigate other actors to go on a strike with me, that&rsquo;s something that happened on the set. There's no conflict of interest with the Hart family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is going on? The assistant named Estelle Rowe rescued Valda Theller and called the police at the set. Now, the Hart family seems to be targeting me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack's head was full of doubts, and all that resentment was directed at Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could I have ended up like this if it weren't for that woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll never let Valda Theller off!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller did not expect herself to... fall asleep as soon as she closed her eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides that, she slept so... peacefully!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered entering the ward around three o&rsquo;clock, and now, it was dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How long was I asleep?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&rsquo;re up? Are you hungry?" The familiar elegant voice rang in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller immediately sat up and could not help wailing. She sat up so fast that it tugged at a painful part of her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're hurt. Don't move so fast," the elegant voice said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at the figure still in the ward. "You... didn't go home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I stayed here since I was free. We were supposed to gon a date today. It&rsquo;s not a bad idea for us to have a date in the ward,&rdquo; said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller blinked. It did not sound that bad if she thought about it that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, her stomach grumbled. She looked at him rather sheepishly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I guess you should be hungry since you've slept for 10 hours," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was instantly shocked to hear that. "10 hours? What time is it now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nearly four o'clock in the morning," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her jaw dropped. She had slept for so long. "Have you been up the whole time?" There was a foldable sofa bed for escorts in the ward, but it now looked like a sofa instead of a bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, his clothes were neat with few wrinkles. He did not look like he had slept.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I didn't sleep. What about you? What would you like to eat?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's so late now that there aren't many places open, right?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even establishments selling supper usually closed at one to two in the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said calmly, "Since I asked you, you only have to tell me what you want to eat and you'll have it. But the doctor said you should eat less spicy and greasy food these days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Porridge, then," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian took out his phone, made a call, and said to Valda Theller, "It&rsquo;ll be delivered in about 20 minutes."</p></div>
