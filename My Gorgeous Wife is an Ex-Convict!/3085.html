        <h1>Chapter 3083</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her and said, "So, you actually returned to Emerald City a long time ago, but you have been unwilling to meet me, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her teeth clenched tighter against her lips, and the anxiety on her face only made his heart ache more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her current appearance is as if she is clearly telling him that she is afraid of him and wants to avoid him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But what is she afraid of? What does she need to hide from?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For these days, all he could think of was her. He was determined to find her and tried his best to search for her through his connections in cities outside of Emerald City, but strangely, he didn't search for her in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never imagined that one day she would appear in Emerald City and avoid him like this, staying in a small hotel instead of meeting him face to face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought that she had just returned to Emerald City and went to see Camille first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But unexpectedly, she returned to Emerald City much earlier than he had anticipated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he felt that his desperate search and inner torment, even his love, seemed like a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, if you really don't want to see me, you don't have to resort to being homeless. Just tell me and that's enough!" Brian suddenly laughed bitterly and said, "During the time you were missing, I told myself that if I ever found you, I would do anything to fulfill your wishes, no matter what they were. So... just tell me and I'll make it happen! I promise!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His smile made her heart suddenly ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She opened her mouth, wanting to say something, but didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And he, only left with a sentence, "Rest well, I won't disturb you. I will instruct the servant to take care of you." After saying this, he hurriedly left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Valda was the only person left in this spacious bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sat on the edge of the bed, looking like a deflated balloon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyelids drooped lightly, and her gaze fell on her right leg.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she slowly pulled up her ankle-length nightgown, what she saw were her slightly twisted and deformed calves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How can she stand by his side now, in her current state?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If before, she could shamelessly say that she would try hard to make him fall in love with her, now she can't do it no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she and he were never meant to be in the same world. Now, they just need to return to their own worlds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, do you know? When you said you love me today, I was really happy... so happy, so happy..." She murmured, her voice becoming more and more choked up, while tears kept streaming out of her eyes, flowing down her cheeks one after another...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, when Valda woke up, there were already servants waiting outside her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The servant said, "Miss Theller, please feel free to give me any orders if you need anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda hesitated for a moment and asked, "Where is Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart left early this morning," the servant said, while also sneakily glancing at Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She has only been working here for about six months, and she has only heard that Mr. Hart is looking for a woman. This woman is Mr. Hart's girlfriend who disappeared due to an accident.</p></div>
