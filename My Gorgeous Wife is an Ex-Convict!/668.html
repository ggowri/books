        <h1>Chapter 667</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Grace touched her forehead, she felt a layer of cold sweat. 'What's wrong with me? Did I have a nightmare? The hill in the dream was the hill near the town.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Also... Sceneries from the dream&hellip;' She could not help biting her lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sun shone brightly outside the window. It was sunny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the time. It was almost 11 a.m., and she had slept for a long time. There was a note from Jason on the nightstand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His handwriting was lanky and strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace read the note and knew that he had gone to the office early this morning to deal with the company's business affairs that had accumulated over the days, but he would be back to have dinner with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the words on the note, Grace felt a warmth in her heart. The feeling of anxiety over her dream earlier seemed to fade a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a change of clothes into the bathroom and took a shower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the warm water washed over her, she looked down at her left hand in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if it was still holding the little boy's hand tightly in the dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Bryn... Brien... Or Brian? Bryen? &hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it was just only a matter of pronunciation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, of all the people she knew, the only one with this pronunciation in their name was... Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, the scene in the dream of the little boy and the little girl seemed to be vaguely related to the last dream she had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The dream was also about a little girl and a little boy trying to run away from bad guys, and the little girl led the little boy along the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought it was because Brian had said some strange things, so it made her think and dream about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what happened this time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why was the dream so clear?' Although she could not see the little boy's face in her dream, the things she experienced in her dream felt as if she had experienced them herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had no recollection of such a thing ever happening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If these dreams were related to what Brian had said&hellip; That could not be right. Brian never said anything about the events in her dreams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he did, it was between Stella and Brian. Why did she think the little girl was herself in the dream?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A string of doubts continued to circulate in Grace's mind. Suddenly, her head ached again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With the rushing water, the pain was so bad&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It hurts... What's going on with me? Am I too tired? Or is it because of something else&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Brian looked at Stella Lindsay as she walked toward him. With a self-deprecating chuckle, he stepped forward and asked, "Have you taken care of everything for your grandmother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's all taken care of. My ex-husband called me and said he&rsquo;s willing to divorce me. Thank you," said Stella Lindsay.</p></div>
