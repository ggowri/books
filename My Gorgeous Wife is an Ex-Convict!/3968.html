        <h1>Chapter 3966</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Clarissa was dumbfounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mick didn't pay any attention to Clarissa and just took Nancy's hand, saying, "Let's go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Nancy replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before leaving, she glanced at Clarissa, who had turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In front of the powerful Mick, Clarissa, who had once been a nightmare to her, was nothing more than a clown.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two arrived at Mick's villa, and Mick said to Nancy, "Get a good night's sleep. We have court today, and you didn't sleep well last night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sleep here?" Nancy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, sleep here. Before you sleep, you can take a good shower and I'll prepare some fresh clothes for you," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Nancy had stayed at Mick's villa before, she had never taken a shower or slept there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after hearing his proposal, she felt the exhaustion in her body and did not refuse his kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the servant prepared the water, Nancy walked into the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the large bathtub, warm water flowed, and as she immersed her body in the water, she became a little drowsy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick was wrong. It wasn't that she didn't sleep well last night, but that she hadn't slept well for several days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, whenever she thought about the upcoming court date, she became so nervous that she couldn't sleep well. Now that Clarissa was in jail, it was her turn next...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unconsciously, Nancy leaned her head against the edge of the bathtub, her eyelids gradually becoming heavy, and finally closed as she fell asleep...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, someone lightly knocked on the bathroom door, and when there was no response, they opened it. Mick walked in and looked at Nancy, who was already asleep in the bathtub. He couldn't help but smile and say, "What happened? She fell asleep."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took the towel next to him, squatted down, and carefully lifted her out of the bathtub.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He covered her body with the towel to prevent her from catching a cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person in his arms seemed to feel his presence and nuzzled her head against his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was like a small animal, making people feel sorry for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick placed Nancy on the bed, dried her body with a towel, and was about to dress her when she suddenly murmured, "Mick..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?" He thought she had woken up, but when he looked, her eyes were still closed. Obviously, she was still asleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled and dressed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was like a obedient puppet, letting him dress her as he pleased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick had always thought he had enough self-control. In the past, there were women who tried to seduce him, even stripping naked in front of him. But he had no interest in them and would just throw them out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, facing Nancy's body, he felt a growing heat and his blood seemed to be gathering in a certain part of his body. Even the simple act of dressing her seemed like a form of torture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't known she was asleep, he might have...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>(The text ends here.)</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Mick couldn't help but mock himself. When did he become so unable to control himself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It took him a while to change her clothes, and then he let out a long sigh of relief.</span></p></div>
