        <h1>Chapter 1685</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oh, won't you grown-ups control her? Are you really going to let her play? The piano's worth a million dollars. It&rsquo;ll cost a lot of money to repair the piano if she messes around and breaks it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sure enough, Jasper was stopped by the staff when she sat on the piano bench.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why can he play and not me?" Jasper asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He's different," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the difference?" asked Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, another staff member walked up to that staff member and whispered a few words in their ear. The expression of the staff member who stopped Jasper changed immediately. Then, they respectfully and quickly got out of the way. "I'm sorry, Miss... You can play the piano."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although she found it strange, Jasper sat on the piano bench without giving it much thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Somewhat puzzled, Grace turned to look at Jason. "What happened? Did they recognize you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason smiled lightly. "Maybe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing that Jasper was about to play the piano, the people around them thought they would be watching a joke unfold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace, Jason, and Mick Reed were not worried that Jasper would make a fool of herself. After all, they all knew about the little one's ability. They often listened to her play the piano at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Irene Lynch and Oriel Lynch had no idea about it. They were waiting for Jasper to make a fool of herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Jasper Reed's little hands flew across the piano keys, beautiful music played. Irene Lynch's expression changed while Oriel Lynch widened her eyes in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jasper Reed... is playing the piano? How is that possible? It's just like... how my teacher plays it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch's skills were lacking. She only knew that Jasper played as well as her piano teacher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, that little boy did not think the same. He had a musical talent beyond ordinary people&rsquo;s. No matter what tune it was, he could easily play it after listening to it once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Over time, this talent of his became boring to him. He just played tunes without making any mistakes. He was like a machine. It did not matter to him whether he played it once or a hundred times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he experienced a different feeling when he listened to this little girl who was about his age playing the same piece he had just played.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is this what the teacher called &lsquo;feelings&rsquo;? Why is she able to express &lsquo;feelings&rsquo; when she plays when we&rsquo;re both about the same age?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"William, you're a genius, a real genius! You're only five years old. Even if you can't express &lsquo;feelings&rsquo; in your music now, you'll understand more about it when you're older. Then maybe you'll know how to do it." The teacher had said to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he did not care.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Playing the piano or any other instrument was just a way for him to pass the time anyway. He did not find it interesting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, as he listened to the little girl playing the piece, he suddenly had a thought. 'Is playing the piano that fun? Why can she play it... so happily?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the tune ended, the surrounding onlookers were silent. They seemed to be absorbed in the music and also shocked by Jasper Reed&rsquo;s playing skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper jumped down from the bench and rushed over to the little boy. "You could have played like this, but why didn't you? Big Beard said you can just get a robot to play the piano if you're going to play without any feelings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy pressed his lips together without speaking, but his beautiful eyes kept staring at Jasper Reed.</p></div>
