        <h1>Chapter 4007</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy heard Irene's scream, as well as the shouts and roars of others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But soon, it was as if she couldn't hear anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All she could hear was the sound of the rushing wind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And what finally caught her eye was the blood-red sky dyed by the setting sun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sky under the sunset was so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, the choice she made must be the best one! Nancy thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She did what she said, and this time, she didn't break her promise!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wish under the wishing tree, hoping it can come true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">First wish: Mick can be safe and healthy in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Second wish: Mick can be happy and joyful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Third wish: One day in the future, Mick can find someone he truly loves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The huge impact made Nancy quickly lose consciousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her whole body was submerged in the sea!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!" A mournful cry echoed at the edge of the cliff. Mick almost rushed towards the edge of the cliff. If it weren't for the Reed family's bodyguard holding him back, he would have stepped on those detonating wires.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Other bodyguards and William quickly bypassed those detonating wires and brought Jasper to a safe place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when the 10 minutes mentioned by Irene arrived, there was no explosion at the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, Irene never intended to cause an explosion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The so-called choice was that Irene only planned to let Nancy die from the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted Nancy to die by Mick's choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me go! Let me go!" Mick shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But there were more than one bodyguard holding him back at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were several of them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick couldn't break free at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Calm down. There may be many bombs buried near the cliff edge now. Nancy has fallen down, and I will immediately contact the police to send a search and rescue team!" Jason spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace had already dialed the phone number of the police at this moment, quickly informing them of the situation and asking them to send people to search.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fallen down..." Mick murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No, she didn't fall down. She jumped down with her life on the line!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why... why did she do that, why?!" Why did she make such a choice?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clearly, he hadn't made a decision yet, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's because she didn't want to make things difficult for you." Jason sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Nancy resolutely pulled Irene down into the sea, even he was shocked by Nancy's determination and courage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It also reminded him of his wife's decision to jump into the sea for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy...made the same decision as Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Does this mean that the child truly loves Mick?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's struggling body suddenly became still.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Don't you want to make things difficult for him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his mind, the words she said to him under the wishing tree kept flashing back to him--</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If one day you need me, even if it means going through fire and water, I will repay you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Repay? Is this her way of repaying him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew he cared about Jasper and didn't want Jasper to be in any danger, so she took the initiative to jump off the cliff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even when she jumped off the cliff, she took Irene with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She really did go through fire and water, just as she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what about him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he never sees her again...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she truly disappears from this world...</p></div>
