        <h1>Chapter 3798</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did Daniel sue you?" Veronica asked nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Mason replied, putting away his phone and starting the car. The car slowly left the parking lot and headed towards Veronica's residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was silence in the car all the way, and Veronica's mind was filled with thoughts of Daniel suing Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In theory, the Reed family should already know about Daniel being beaten by Mason and have definitely been in contact with Daniel to discuss compensation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that Daniel is suing, does that mean they couldn't agree on compensation? Or is it that Daniel doesn't want compensation at all and is determined to make Mason pay the price?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, she felt a sense of self-blame. If she hadn't been taken to the hospital by Daniel that day, if she hadn't asked Mason for help in the car, then none of this would have happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can she get Daniel to withdraw the lawsuit? Does she have a way? Would it be useful for her to go see Daniel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, if she could persuade Daniel, then when she accompanied him for treatment after he was injured, she should have been able to persuade him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel has become stubborn and unreasonable. Such a person is impossible to persuade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Auntie Grace is a lawyer herself, she should have a way! At this moment, Veronica pinned her hopes on Grace.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she came back to her senses, the car had already stopped downstairs at her </span><span>apartment building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Get out," Mason said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh." Veronica quickly unbuckled her seat belt, and the two got out of the car and walked towards the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Veronica opened the door to her residence and entered with Mason, the feeling of loneliness in the one-room apartment seemed to have disappeared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During these days after the breakup, whenever she was alone in the room, she felt an overwhelming sense of suffocating loneliness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she had lived alone in this house before dating him, she never felt this cold and lonely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, what do you want to talk about? You can talk now," Mason spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um... why don't you sit on the couch first?" she said to him, as he stood by the entrance looking like he only wanted to stay for a moment and leave. But she didn't want him to leave so soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, he was willing to talk to her properly, and she wanted to make the most of this opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason hesitated for a moment, but eventually sat down on the couch as Veronica had hoped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica specially brewed a cup of tea and placed it in front of Mason. She knew he liked to drink plain tea, and she always made him tea whenever he came to her place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he sipped his tea, he looked like a painting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, although there was plain tea in front of him, he didn't seem interested in drinking it. His beautiful, narrow eyes just stared coldly at her. "What do you want to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica pursed her dry lips and gathered her courage. "Can we not break up?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His pupils shrank almost imperceptibly. "I've already said it. I'm tired and don't want to continue this relationship anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really that tiring to be with me?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it is," he said. He always felt uneasy, even when she was by his side. Memories of the past flashed through his mind like a slideshow, but without any emotions. He remembered her expression when she said she wanted to date Daniel, her bright smile, her walks with Daniel on campus, her holding Daniel's hand and standing in front of him... even later, when she fought with him because of Daniel...</span></p></div>
