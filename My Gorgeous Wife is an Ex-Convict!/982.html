        <h1>Chapter 981</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, even if she had a license to practice law, she would probably be out of business if she were to attempt being a lawyer again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter said, "It's great that you're taking it easy. I'll let you handle some small cases if there are any. You can build a reputation first. It'll be useful for your future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After coming out of Lawyer Carter's office, the receptionist informed Grace that a Mr. Harto had been waiting for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to the reception room and saw Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper was immediately at a loss at the sight of Grace. His face grew red as if he wanted to say something but did not know what exactly to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You might as well just tell me whatever you want," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I came here today because I heard that there's hope for Baldwin's case. It seems that Elise Dean is going to be added as the defendant! I heard from Baldwin's parents that Lawyer Carter called and told them it's all because you found the clue, so I just wanted to come by today and thank you!" Chase Harper said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought of the key point because you remembered that Elise Dean was also wearing the ruby ring that day. Speaking of which, I should thank you," Grace said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper gave a simple and honest smile. Then, as if hesitating, he said, "By the way, is the Master Reed who came to the police station yesterday&hellip; your brother from before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened a little, but she did not want to lie to Chase Harper. "Yeah."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He must be Jason, right? I heard Young Master Hart calling him Jason yesterday," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, he's Jason," answered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper's face could not hide his shock. It was one thing to guess it and another to know the truth. He could not help being shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you and Jason siblings?" he asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated, and there was a flicker of sadness and self-mockery in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Siblings?' The word that used to be so sweet to her now meant something else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper noticed this and said quickly, "Sorry, you don't have to answer me if it isn't convenient for you. I was just... shocked at the police station yesterday. Jason and Brian are..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper's voice became lower and lower as he spoke. "Come to think of it, I overestimated myself. You have such outstanding men around you, and I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wanted to argue that this was not the reason she did not like Chase Harper, but on second thought, it would be a good thing if she let Chase Harper down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Chase Harper deserves a good woman who's suitable for him. I've suffered a lot in life, and my heart has suffered a lot of heartbreaks. I'm not suitable for him!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright. That's all I have to say. I gotta go now," said Chase Harper. He was about to turn around to leave, but just before he left, he seemed to have thought of something and said, "By the way, I think Young Master Hart really loves you. Yesterday when he knew you were missing, he went to press Elise Dean about your whereabouts. He seemed to be willing to kill for you just to make sure you're safe! If Elise Dean hadn't said anything, maybe... He would have strangled her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper sighed. He had asked himself if he would do the same and knew he was not able to do that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would be anxious and miserable over her disappearance, but... He would not kill for her.</p></div>
