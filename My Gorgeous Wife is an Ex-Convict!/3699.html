        <h1>Chapter 3697</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Veronica left, the manager next to Angelica asked, "Aren't you afraid that this little assistant will say something bad about you in front of Mason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She wouldn't dare," Angelica confidently replied, "Her personality is very quiet and she doesn't dare to say much. Besides, if she really said something, she wouldn't be able to keep this job. I've looked into it, and if she loses this job, she probably won't even be able to pay her tuition."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager frowned, "But I heard that she knows people from the Reed family. How could she not be able to pay her tuition?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Knowing someone is one thing, there are many people who know the Reed family. Do you think everyone can benefit from them?" Angelica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I heard that Mason helped her block the pasta you threw and protected her in public," the manager said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica's expression couldn't hold up, "What protection, it was just a coincidence. Do you really think Mason would be interested in a poor little assistant like Veronica?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager thought about it and realized he was overthinking it, "Yeah, you're right. It's not easy to climb up to the Reed family, only top celebrities can do it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica felt a bit uneasy and pursed her lips. If she hadn't thrown that bowl of pasta, would she have had a better first encounter with Mason?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that were the case, she could have left a better impression on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's all because of Veronica's connection! Thinking of this, Angelica became even more disgusted with Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After work, Veronica put the dry-cleaned suit in a bag and headed to the subway station to go to the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of the servants at the Reed family's house know her, so she plans to hand over the suit to them when she arrives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for meeting Mason... Veronica sighed bitterly. He doesn't want to see her at all. He even told her not to appear in front of him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she never thought about returning the suit to him in person. As for Angelica's instructions, she will tell the servants and have them relay the message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Twenty minutes later, Veronica left the subway station and headed towards the Reed family's mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is a wealthy area, and there are noticeably more luxury cars on the road than elsewhere. As she got closer to the Reed family's mansion, there were fewer and fewer people around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Veronica was about to arrive, a silver-gray car drove towards her and suddenly stopped in front of her after passing by. Then, a figure got out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked and saw that it was Mason. She suddenly became a little flustered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her and walked straight up to her. "Why are you here?" he asked in a cold voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm here to return your suit." She stuttered a bit, then fumbled in her bag and took out the suit, presenting it to him as if to prove that she really came to return it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't even look at the suit. His eyes were still fixed on her as he repeated his question, "Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip. "I... I don't know where else to go to return your suit except here." Although Jasper had said that he was now an exchange student at Stanford University, she didn't know which department or class he was in.</span></p></div>
