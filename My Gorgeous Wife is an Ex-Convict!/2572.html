        <h1>Chapter 2570</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow told George Gregory how Amber Mitchell was tortured in the mental hospital and about the basement of the Mitchell family&rsquo;s mansion where Louise Mitchell hid Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even an onlooker like Philip Barlow could not help sighing at the incident. An heiress who used to be so glamorous was reduced to such a state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory could only feel a throbbing pain in his heart. It was so severe that it was difficult for him to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman he took great care of had suffered such treatment, but he... had something to do with it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He failed to protect her and even put her through all that pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did she grow to hate me when she was suffering?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I deserve her hatred! What was I doing while she was tortured? I was enjoying being a happy family of three!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What... What have I done?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Philip Barlow was done speaking, he looked at George Gregory and found that the man in front of him was already in tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one in Deer City had ever seen George Gregory cry like this! One could tell that he was extremely miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's all I know," said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's... all..." muttered George Gregory before suddenly laughing, but his laughter sounded so sad. What Philip Barlow said just made him feel distressed. Then... all those years of...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not even imagine it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow sighed. Indeed, sometimes, it was better not to know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The meal eventually turned into a drinking session with George Gregory drinking glass after glass as if trying to vent all the anguish in his heart. Philip Barlow accompanied him to drink a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not drink much, though. He controlled himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, George Gregory was terribly drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow looked at the time and said, "I'll have someone take you home." He walked over to George Gregory's chair and helped him up as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory shouted, "Tell me... Why... do I still feel so bad after drinking so much? Why did things turn out this way? Why wasn't I the one... who rescued her..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's already happened. There's no point in thinking about the past now. Instead, why don't you think about how you can get her to forgive you?" Philip Barlow said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory sobbed. "No, she won't forgive me... She'll never forgive me for as long as she lives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, George Gregory grabbed Philip Barlow's arm. It was as though he was about to drown and finally managed to grab onto a piece of driftwood. "Tell me. What do I have to do so that Amby can forgive me and fall in love with me again..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow looked at the miserable-looking George Gregory and could only reply, "I don't know. It's because I&rsquo;ve never wanted anyone to fall in love with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory muttered, "Then you... You must have never been in love with anyone. It's nice not to have loved anyone... all your life... That way, you won't be as miserable as I am... But... I can't... I can't help loving her..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's crying made Philip Barlow sympathize with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After helping George Gregory out of the club, Philip Barlow asked the driver to take him home before driving himself back to the Barlow family&rsquo;s house.</p></div>
