        <h1>Chapter 1437</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next moment, Jason hugged Grace from behind. He held her carefully as he breathed in her ears. "What if it were me? Would you forgive me if I did something wrong and cried like that one day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace laughed. "What are you talking about? I was talking about Martin Weiss. Why mention yourself all of a sudden? Besides, you haven't done anything wrong. Why would you cry?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I was just asking... what if," he muttered. His lips gently kissed her earlobes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was so attached to her and so scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her body trembled, and her cheeks went red. She could feel his lips on her ears. 'Come on. Doesn't he know I'll be&hellip; easily tempted when he does that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She turned around and glared at him with a faint blush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Will you forgive me? Or... will you be like Kyla Corbyn and how she&rsquo;s treating Martin Weiss now? Whether alive or dead..." He could not go on somehow, perhaps because he was too afraid he would hit the nail on the head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Since when did he start being so paranoid?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It seemed as if anything related to her would make him less like himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace only found Jason's beautiful eyes seemingly stained with a touch of pity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At the same time, she had been feeling more and more maternal since getting pregnant. It seemed as if her heart would break to see such a pitiful gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She raised her hands and held his face, saying, "You're not really going to cry after doing something wrong, are you? You're a father-to-be. You have to set an example. But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She paused and touched his cheeks with her palms, taking advantage of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Hmm... It feels so good!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'd feel bad if you really do end up crying like Martin Weiss! Perhaps I'll forgive you for whatever you've done," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stared deeply into her eyes, taking her hand gently and kissing her palm with his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then it's a deal," he murmured, finally kissing her on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He loved her temperature, softness, and scent a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If only his Grace could stay by his side forever...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace went to see Kyla Corbyn the next day and asked, "Did you reject Martin Weiss's liver donation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How did you find out?" asked Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Last night, Martin Weiss got drunk and came to me, asking me what he could do to make you accept his liver donation. He was drunk and a little delirious. He was crying the whole time," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn's eyelashes quivered slightly. Hearing these words now felt as if she were listening to someone else's matters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Whether Martin Weiss was drunk or had cried, it could no longer cause the slightest waves in her heart.</p></div>
