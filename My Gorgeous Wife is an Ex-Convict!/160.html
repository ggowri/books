        <h1>Chapter 159</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Grace ate the dishes, she still could not figure out exactly what Brian wanted to do. Did he really just want to thank her, so he was treating her to a meal?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Miss Cummins used to be Sean's girlfriend?" Brian suddenly asked halfway through the meal.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's hand suddenly froze on the chopsticks. She lowered her head and said, "Yes." Indeed, people like him would have already investigated her thoroughly before having a meal with her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The reason you broke up with him was because of the car accident that year?" he continued to ask.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So what if it was?" She lifted her head and asked back, "Mr. Hart, the person whom I knocked down and killed back then was Jason's fiance&#769;e. In Emerald City, who would dare to associate with me?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I dare," he said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was stunned. She looked at the person in front of him with a surprised expression, and her mind suddenly went blank.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What do you think? Do you want to try being with me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing these words, not only did Grace not have any ambiguous feelings, she felt her scalp go numb. The man in front of her, with a distant and indifferent expression on his face, had said these words as if she was just an object to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just an object that he had taken an interest in.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"As far as I know, Mr. Hart, you seem to have gotten a new girlfriend just recently," she said, referring to the gossip she had heard at the Sanitation Service Center earlier.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, there's indeed a woman, but if you go out with me, I will break up with her," he said in a serious tone.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">What was he joking about!? Grace suddenly had a funny feeling. It seemed that this Crown Prince was really casual when it came to getting into a relationship with someone.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why?" She was puzzled. When it came to her appearance, if it had been a few years ago, she wouldn't have looked too bad. However, after three years of imprisonment, in addition to facing the sun and wind every day and neglecting proper maintenance, there was really nothing about her that could attract anyone's attention.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Your face looks pretty good. I like it," he said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"My face?" She couldn't help touching her face. She didn't think that her face was any better than those of the actresses in the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">What's more, there were a variety of beautiful actresses who were willing to be his girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Especially your eyes," he said. "Your eyes are very beautiful, yet your gaze is too bitter and too heavy."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he said this, his eyes kept staring into hers. "What do you think? Do you want to date me?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He appeared casual, but the look in his eyes seemed to penetrate her, making her unable to breathe.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace stood up abruptly. "I'm going to the ladies room." She looked for an excuse and then left the private room in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian gently lowered his eyes, a hint of playfulness appearing around the corners of his lips.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In a daze, Grace looked at her own face in the washroom's mirror. She had not applied makeup on her thin face. It was only acceptable at most. As for her eyes, she had never thought that her eyes were beautiful. At most, they were pleasant-looking. They were definitely not the kind of eyes that would stun people.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Could it be that Brian had truly taken a fancy to her? Or was this just a whim of his? Just like Jason, he felt that she was novel and wanted to play a game?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she thought of Jason, Grace could only feel a stabbing pain in her heart once again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her Jay was no longer there. That man in her heart, who had been so pure and clean, was no longer there.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Shaking her head, Grace had just walked out of the washroom when someone suddenly rushed in front of her, raised a hand, and slapped her.</p></div>
