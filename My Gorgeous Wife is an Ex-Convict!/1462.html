        <h1>Chapter 1461</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jay knew from the very beginning that I was wronged, but for the benefit of the company, he chose to do nothing. He chose to say nothing, let me go to prison, and let the Atkinson family wrongly accuse me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, Grace only felt cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The steps leading to the first floor in front of her were only a short distance away, and the number of steps was only 30 or so. However, why did she feel that the steps seemed to be getting longer and longer? She eventually had the feeling that she would never reach the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you really want to give Grace justice, you should let Lily be punished by the law! Both you and the Atkinson family need to accept your due punishment!" Brian said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He felt bursts of pain in his heart at the thought that Grace was wrongly convicted because of Lily. 'If I... If I had been by her side, I would never have allowed her to be so unjustly wronged.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A touch of rage suddenly burst in Jason's eyes. He rushed forward and grabbed Brian's collar, "What do you know? Who are you to talk like that in front of me? If I had met Grace earlier and fallen in love with her earlier, I wouldn&rsquo;t have let her suffer back then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian sneered, "Yeah, it&rsquo;s because you haven't fallen in love with her at that time, so... her suffering didn&rsquo;t matter to you. She's nothing but an ant to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Brian, what's your purpose in coming here and telling me this? What's the matter? Are you trying to tell Grace about this? Are you going to tell her that I didn't do anything back then? Are you going to tell her that I know who&rsquo;s responsible for it? If you dare tell her, I'll... kill you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not a false threat but a clear message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing Jason's fierce behavior, Brian, who had known him for many years, could naturally see how serious he was. He would do anything to hide this fact!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I won't," said Brian. Since he had chosen to tell Jason about it, he had already made up his mind. "But it&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m afraid of you. It's only for Grace's sake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was now more than seven months pregnant. Besides, Grace had given him the answers to his question at the funeral today, making him unwilling to ruin her happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although, he knew that if he told her, Grace and Jason's relationship would probably suffer and Grace might even leave Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... if the life now was what Grace wanted, then... perhaps it was the end of the matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian also wondered why Old Master Reed had not given the materials to Grace straight but to him instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps... Old Master Reed was also hesitating whether to let Grace know about this, so he chose to let him&hellip; make the decision?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Not many people knew about his feelings for Grace, but Old Master Reed probably knew about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He seemed to have made the same choice as the old master, choosing not to tell Grace about the matter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But Jason, if you do Grace wrong one day, I'll expose the truth. Even if I can't bring you down, at least you'll get the punishment you deserve!" snapped Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There won't be such a day!" Jason said coldly.</p></div>
