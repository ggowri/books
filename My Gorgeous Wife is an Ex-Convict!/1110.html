        <h1>Chapter 1109</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll keep my promise, and you mustn't forget it, got it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if that childlike voice was surrounding her ears again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she forgot about it and did not recognize him afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a thump, Grace knelt in front of Jason. Her kneeling immediately surprised the two men present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Jason's eyes were full of disbelief. "What are you doing? Are you kneeling for Brian? I won't stop even if you get down on your knees!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This has nothing to do with Brian!" Grace took a deep breath and said calmly. The moment she knelt, her panic and hesitation suddenly faded away. "The thing between you and me has nothing to do with others. Even if you said you still love me, I simply can't afford your love. So Jason... let me go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let you... go?" Jason's body suffered an imperceptible tremor, and his face instantly turned incredibly pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even now, he would rather she beg him to let Brian go than her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know what you're talking about?" he murmured, loosening his grip on Brian as he looked down at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Grace. That simple word made Jason feel as if someone had taken a gun and shot him in the heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would have given all he had at her feet, yet she wanted him to let her go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Let go. Did that mean their relationship all this time was only to let go or not to let go? "Grace, what am I to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice rang hoarsely. It was as if he was yelling out with so much force and hate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could she utter the two words 'let go' so lightly and kneel in front of me so easily?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked up, and those quiet almond-shaped eyes looked at him calmly. "We were a mistake from the start. Maybe you shouldn't have saved me, and I shouldn't have taken you back to the rental house and let you call me &lsquo;Sis&rsquo;. Jason, we have never belonged to the same world. I can't give you the love you want, and you can't give me the trust I want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice and every word and sentence were like a boulder hitting his heart mercilessly. It hurt so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long while, Jason finally said, "You're begging me to let you go. Letting go means that from now on, you and I will have nothing to do with each other. In this case, do you still want me to let you go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip and nodded gently. "Yes, I beg you to let me go." This relationship had been overwhelming for her, and she did not want this entanglement to go on anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since they realized they could not give each other what they wanted, it would be best to let each other go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expression on Jason's face gradually disappeared. His desperate expression earlier seemed to have turned into a cold silence. His eyes were fixed on her, almost unblinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman in front of him had tied her long hair loosely with a hair tie. Her comely face had no makeup, and those almond-shaped eyes were calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such a face was only above average. He had seen many more beautiful women than her, but she was the only one who haunted his dreams and made him love her to the bone!</p></div>
