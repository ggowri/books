        <h1>Chapter 1200</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, Grace finished wiping the upper of his shoe and looked up at him. "Is this alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, her face was as pale as snow and had no trace of color. With her thin body, she looked frail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason unconsciously frowned. The sight of her appearance made him feel uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace waited for a while, and when Jason did not answer her, she touched her nose awkwardly and laughed at herself. She got up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"May I borrow a broom and a dustpan? Let me clear this place up a bit," Grace said to a man in a security guard uniform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" The man was stunned for a moment. He replied quickly after seeing a nod from Terrence. "Okay, give... Give me a second."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said and quickly got a broom and a dustpan, handing them to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hung her head low as she began to clean up her vomit. Jason stood nearby and did not leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since Jason did not leave, the others naturally dared not as well. Therefore, the group of people just watched Grace clean up the place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those black eyes of his stared at the thin figure, and Jason's face darkened even more. The way she looked reminded him of the scene when she swept the streets, but now, she was thinner than she was then. It was as if she would fall when the wind blew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew that he should leave and ignore her. Even if she vomited blood or fainted in front of him, he should ignore her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He should just ignore her like he had done the last few times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he could not take his eyes off her! Jason's face was so gloomy that it looked like it could rain, and his brows furrowed even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing his boss looking like this, Terrence almost dared not breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace was cleaning, she stumbled and was about to fall when Jason immediately rushed forward. He grabbed Grace's arm and walked toward Reed Group&rsquo;s building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was so surprised that she loosened her grip, and the broom dropped to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she came to herself, Jason had already pulled her into the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The senior executives and security guards standing outside stared at each other, still not sure what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A senior executive could not resist asking, "Secretary Gao, this is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't ask. If you ever see that woman again, don't offend her," said Terrence. He instructed the security guards to get the company's cleaners to come and clean up the place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the elevator, Grace said to Jason, "Where are you taking me? Let go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason only pressed his thin lips together and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let go!" She wiggled her wrist and struggled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his five fingers were like steel bars, grasping her wrist firmly. The more she struggled, the more her wrist hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ding dong!</p></div>
