        <h1>Chapter 1216</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, many women in Emerald City wanted to join the Reed family by giving birth to an heir. However, forget about the &lsquo;heir&rsquo;. The &lsquo;mother&rsquo; did not even have the chance to approach Master Reed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was so lucky!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence could not help sighing to himself. He patted the doctor on the shoulder and led him out of the ward with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a private secretary, Terrence naturally knew that his boss needed to calm down and be alone with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was only the sound of the two breathing in the quiet room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason gently raised his hand and touched Grace's belly through the white sheets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had accompanied her to see a gynecologist and naturally knew that she had hurt her uterus before. Even if she wanted to have a baby and took care of her body well, it was extremely difficult to do so even by artificial methods. Not to mention... getting pregnant naturally!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The odds were too small!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, even after they separated and even when he saw her vomit that day, the idea of her being pregnant never occurred to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she was pregnant, and it was their child in her womb!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was their baby a boy or a girl? What would they look like?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand moved from her belly to her pale cheek, his long fingers caressing it. Everywhere his fingertips touched was chilly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He muttered, "Do you know you're pregnant? If it were up to you, I'm afraid you wouldn't want to have my child, but... now that we have a child together, will..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice stopped as if thousands of words were stuck in his throat. However, what he finally spat out was... "Will you still leave me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the person who was sound asleep could not answer him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know how long she had been asleep. When she woke up, what she saw was the unfamiliar white ceiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Where... am I?' She blinked her eyes subconsciously and slowly remembered that she had gone to Reed Group and asked Jason to lend her two million dollars. Then she was rejected by Jason, and... she planned to leave... Then she could not remember anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did I... pass out?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're awake." A magnetic and cold voice rang in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shuddered and immediately sat up. She widened her eyes and stared at Jason, who was in the room, in surprise. "How did you..." Then, her gaze fell upon the furnishings and medical equipment in the room. She immediately came to her senses. "Is this the hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "You fainted. That's why you were brought here. You've been unconscious for seven hours. What would you like to eat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her dry lips together. "No thanks. Thank you for sending me to the hospital, but I'm afraid I can't pay for the treatment now. I'll pay you back slowly later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she threw back the sheets and got out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, because she had just woken up and had not eaten for a long time, she felt a fit of weakness as soon as she got out of bed. She stumbled and was about to fall, but Jason stretched out his long arm and caught Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, she was in his arms.</p></div>
