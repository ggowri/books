        <h1>Chapter 426</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Grace was finally done with guiding Jason through her nail trimming process.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Consequently, Grace felt tired from the whole ordeal, and it would have been much easier for her to cut her nails on her own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the other party seemed to have gotten addicted to trimming nails as they looked at Grace&rsquo;s other fingernails before starting to trim them one by one. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After everything was done, Jason said in an unsatiated tone, &ldquo;When your nails grow in the future, I&rsquo;ll help you trim them again.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;...&rdquo; Grace felt somewhat speechless for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was still noon, and if Grace went to the hospital to visit Nelson, it would still be a tad bit too early.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hence, while Jason returned to his desk to deal with his company&rsquo;s affairs, Grace took out her mobile phone and began to scroll through information on a web page.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Out of the blue, a trending topic caught her attention; it was about Evelyn, and it touted her as a winner in life as she had obtained both love and a successful career.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It also stated that Evelyn had decided to attend the GF dinner that would be held in Emerald City with Brian. The people who would attend the dinner were the top CEOs in Emerald City. Therefore, the news was also a means to state that Evelyn had dispelled the rumors about her breakup and her relationship with Brian was actually still standing strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the trending topic, several pictures of Evelyn endorsing products as well as photos of her as the cover girl of fashion magazines could be found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was undeniable that the amount of support Evelyn had was strong, but&hellip; Grace&rsquo;s eyes turned gloomy unconsciously. Anyone could tell that the support Evelyn was getting was all coming from Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Brian broke up with her, her future would certainly not be as bright as it was now. Additionally, people like Brian hated being pestered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the very least, Grace had seen how ruthless Brian could be when she saw the way he treated his ex-girlfriend after being harassed by the latter</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Where would Evelyn end up in the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace scoffed at the thought of it. Whatever that would happen to Evelyn, whether it was her rise or downfall, it had nothing to do with her. Evelyn had treated Grace as a sister before and used to help her find ways to gain support in her career. However, when Grace was imprisoned, she no longer received the same affection because of how her family treated her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace continued to scroll through the webpages and she skimmed through them. After a while, she began to feel slightly drowsy. Thus, she leaned her body against the sofa before gradually closing her eyelids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason lifted his head, he noticed Grace lying on her side on the sofa with her eyes closed; she was asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Jason stood up and tiptoed toward Grace. Her sleeping face at that moment was quiet and tranquil. Furthermore, her curled eyelashes had cast a shadow on her eyelids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at Grace&rsquo;s sleeping face obsessively as if looking at her would give his heart a sense of peace and satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, after a while, Jason took a blanket from the lounge next to him and gently used it to cover Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He used to think that wanting someone would be a straightforward thing for him. However, he now realized that he did not want to use any power to win over the heart of the one he wanted to be with; he wanted her to be with him willingly. Her words, the look in her eyes, and her actions could cost him a sleepless night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;When will you fall in love with me? How long will you keep me waiting?&rdquo; he murmured. The only response he got was the silent air that circulated the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace opened her eyes, she awoke to a familiar ceiling. In an instant, she quivered and abruptly sat up, trying to recover from her daze.</p></div>
