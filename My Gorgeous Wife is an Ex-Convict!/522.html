        <h1>Chapter 521</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They criticized me a little and trampled over my dress," said Grace, not wanting to vent her frustrations there. "Sorry, you brought me here today. I'm afraid I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's there to apologize for? It was I who neglected you and caused this to happen to you today," Jason interrupted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he crouched down and gently tied her ripped hem into a knot to keep it from dragging on the ground in case she ended up stepped on it herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason crouched down, everyone around them gasped. They had not expected Emerald City's famous Young Master Reed to kneel in front of a woman like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After helping Grace with the hem of her dress, Jason once again tilted his chin back slightly, looked up at Grace, and asked. "Did you get hurt anywhere?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, Jason was crouching, and his head was thrown back. On the other hand, Grace was standing with her head lowered. The two were looking at each other, and for a moment, Grace felt as if Jason was subdued at her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Oh my God. What was she thinking? Grace quickly said to herself before shaking her head and saying, "No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was not the only one who felt that way because everyone else who had seen the scene also felt the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The god-like man that was high up in their minds was now crouching on his knees before a woman who seemed insignificant to them. It was as if he had placed himself in a lowly position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was this Jason?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In particular, Tasha Farmer, who had regained her footing after much difficulty, looked incredulous. How could Jason be so humble to a woman who had been to prison? How was it possible?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Oh right, that woman must have hidden her imprisonment from him. Thus, he had no idea about the woman's past. That had to be it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer shouted abruptly, "Don't be fooled by that woman, Young Master Reed. She has been to prison, and it was she who killed your fiancee, Jennifer Atkinson, in the car accident!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Tasha Farmer said this, the air around her seemed to freeze. Jason looked up at Tasha Farmer coldly, and the latter was instantly made uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was going on? She was exposing Grace to be a liar. However, why was it that she was the one feeling uneasy now? Furthermore, Grace showed no signs of fear. Instead&hellip; she looked calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason merely gave Tasha Farmer a cold look before withdrawing his gaze. Then, he stood up and picked Grace up under everyone&rsquo;s gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace let out a low cry and subconsciously put her arms around Jason's neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I didn't hurt my foot," Grace said as she bit her lip slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know," Jason replied. He showed no intention of letting her down. Instead, he turned to Patrick and said, "I have to go, Patrick."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, sure," Patrick answered. Moments later, Jason walked out of the banquet hall with Grace in his arms. His mind was still in a state of extreme shock.</p></div>
