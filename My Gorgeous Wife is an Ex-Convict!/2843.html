        <h1>Chapter 2841</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if they lived together and looked affectionate in front of people, it was false. They were still going to get divorced in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"One day, you&rsquo;ll also have a new relationship. You'll meet a woman who loves you very much, and you&rsquo;ll love her too," said Kyla as she tried hard to smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had no idea that her smile stung his eyes. "You want me to have a romantic relationship?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I do," replied Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face darkened. "Are you that eager to get rid of me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's smile gradually froze. "Martin, none of us is getting rid of the other. All we did was lose each other. I lost you, and you lost me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those events eventually became a bitter pill that was hard to swallow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The highlight of the charity gala, the auction, began. A wide variety of things were being auctioned, but they were all &lsquo;costly&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At a charity gala like this, spending money on auctions was a way to flaunt your wealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people even deliberately raised the price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was a little fidgety. Her portrait was up next. It would be embarrassing if no one bought it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She figured she would buy it herself for 10,000 or 20,000 dollars if no one would buy it. The money would go to charity anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry." Brian's voice rang suddenly in her ears. "If no one buys your portrait later, I will."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you know..." Valda Theller looked blankly at Brian. He figured out what was on her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anyone can tell by the look on your face," he said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She touched her cheek. "Is it that obvious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Yeah, but why did you think about donating the portrait? You could&rsquo;ve just taken off the earrings and donated them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They're yours. How can I give them away without permission?" Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you're wearing the jewelry, they're yours," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But they&rsquo;re too&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Are you going to say they're too expensive? But you should know that they mean nothing to me, so you don't have to worry too much about it. You can do whatever you want with the gowns and jewelry I give you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller knew Brian was telling the truth, and she would definitely take good care of everything he gave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how things ended up between them, she would treasure the things he gave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, it was time for Valda Theller's portrait to be auctioned. However, Valda Theller did not expect Phoebe Cross to participate in the auction and shout 50,000 dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at Phoebe Cross with some doubt while Phoebe Cross smiled. According to the procedure, the buyer would be interviewed by the emcee, who would ask why the buyer wanted to bid on the item.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could take the opportunity to humiliate Valda Theller. She could call it worthless work, but she took pity on Valda Theller and bought it.</p></div>
