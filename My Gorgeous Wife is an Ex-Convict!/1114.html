        <h1>Chapter 1113</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina blinked her eyes. She took out her phone and started searching for Four Seas Property.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Elizabeth Jackson almost had an impulse to faint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this woman telling me through her actions that she hasn't heard of Four Seas Property?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elizabeth Jackson felt like she had been slapped in the face. She thought Lina would be shocked to hear her mention Four Seas Property, but instead... she was looking it up on the search engine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After reading the online introduction of Four Seas Property, Lina smiled. "Okay, I know your background, but you said that you're the marriage partner decided by the Stephenson family and you and Hadwin will get engaged. That means you're not engaged yet, are you? You're the marriage partner decided by the first wife of the Stephenson family, but Hadwin Stephenson probably hasn't decided yet. Therefore, you have nothing to do with him, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina did not believe Hadwin Stephenson would marry this woman at all. Somehow, she trusted Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Perhaps this is the so-called power of love!' Lina thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elizabeth Jackson clenched her teeth with hatred as she glared at Lina. The woman was right. The marriage was decided by the Jackson family and the first wife of the Stephenson family. Hadwin Stephenson never said yes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I... Ahem!" Lina coughed twice, raised her chin, and grinned at Elizabeth Jackson. "I'm Hadwin's girlfriend. I'm official! So Miss Jackson, don't you think it's a bit ridiculous for you to tell me to leave Hadwin?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elizabeth Jackson snorted coldly, thinking Lina was deliberately putting on a show. She went straight to the point and said, "How much money do you want for you to leave Hadwin Stephenson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's eyes lit up. 'Damn, I never expected the scenario in novels and TV dramas where people use money to get rid of someone to actually happen to me one day.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she was the one that was being rid of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to give me money?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elizabeth Jackson mistakenly thought Lina's eyes had lit up because of money. She sneered in her heart. 'She&rsquo;s indeed a money-hungry woman!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is five million enough?" asked Elizabeth Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she looked disgusted. "Only five million? Is Hadwin only worth five million? Five million is only enough to buy a house in Emerald City, and it&rsquo;s probably less than 100 square meters in a rather remote area."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then how much do you want?" asked Elizabeth Jackson as she clenched her teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Isn't hundreds of millions of dollars falling from the sky all the rage these days?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elizabeth Jackson almost fainted. The woman in front of her was not the miserable and gullible person she expected. She was simply someone extremely greedy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she pooled all the Jackson family's cash, she could not raise hundreds of millions of dollars all at once!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, are you fooling me?" Elizabeth Jackson clenched her teeth. Her eyes, covered with mascara and eye shadow, glared at Lina angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said, "Aren't you humiliating me by asking me to leave Hadwin for five million? Of course, one of your plans is that you'll give me money to leave, and the other, you'll pretend to say yes and record our conversation. Then, you'll find a chance to show it to Hadwin so that he'll think I'm a money-hungry woman and our relationship will be ruined."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina glanced at Elizabeth Jackson's phone that was on the table as she spoke. However, the phone's back was facing up. The screen was glued to the table, the opposite of how a normal person would place their phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think you're going with the second plan, aren't you, Miss Jackson?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elizabeth Jackson stiffened, her face turning red.</p></div>
