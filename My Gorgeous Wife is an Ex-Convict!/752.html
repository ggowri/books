        <h1>Chapter 751</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to go through the trouble and travel so much. I'm just going to pay my respects and visit Grandma's grave. I'll come back right after," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's no trouble." Jason insisted. "Grace, I&rsquo;ll go because she's your grandmother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's heart suddenly warmed, and her nose tingled a little. Then, she suddenly put her arms around his waist and buried her face in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this what it feels like to be treasured by someone?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at the person who took the initiative to hug him. He gently raised his hand and stroked her hair. "Do you have any birthday wishes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Wish?' After being released from prison, the greatest wish she had was to be able to reverse her case, but now, this wish had already come true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, her wish was... "No matter what I wish for, you'll do it for me?" she asked as she looked at him, raising her head slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'll go through fire and water to do it for you," he answered her in great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll tell you on my birthday, then," Grace said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want him to go through fire and water or risk anything. She just wanted him to believe in her, to believe that she loved him, not to be insecure, and not show that fragile, lonely look in his eyes again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was because... She would feel bad!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure. Then you can tell me when your birthday comes and I'll do it for you," replied Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Martin Weiss was standing in front of the French window of the presidential suite of a hotel, looking out at the neon-lit night scene. Holding his phone in his hand, he said to Paisley Daniels, who was on the other side of the line, "I'm going to stay in Emerald City for some time and go back later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Is there something wrong with the merger there?" Paisley Daniels asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For some reason, Martin Weiss sounded a little strange to her, but she could not say what was strange about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's just something else," said Martin Weiss, not wanting to go into any more detail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels was wise enough to change the subject. "By the way, my parents keep asking me when we&rsquo;re getting married. My father said this October will be an auspicious date. What do you think, Wenming?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Get married&hellip;' Martin Weiss frowned, inexplicably disgusted by the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Zoen is the person I chose, so marrying her is a matter of course. However, why is it that what flashes in my mind is the tearful face of another woman telling me that even in hell, we'd never meet again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll talk about this when I get back," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels was unsatisfied with this vague answer, but she did not dare to say anything over the phone. Instead, she obediently answered, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm no longer young. I thought Wenming's heart would be mine after forcing that woman, Kyla, to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, it seems to me that Wenming's heart is growing more and more distant these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Paisley Daniels thought about the woman, she was filled with jealousy and hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Similarly, Martin Weiss felt breathless when he thought of Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, Martin Weiss's eyes fell again onto the brightly lit night scene outside the window.</p></div>
