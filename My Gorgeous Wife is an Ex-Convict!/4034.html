        <h1>Chapter 4032</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I stay here any longer, we might have another argument. What you need most now is rest. Whatever decision you make, you can talk to your doctor about it." Mick said, trying to pull his clothes away from Nancy's grip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her hand held onto his clothes even tighter. "Don't go, Mick, please don't go...please!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her pleading voice, with obvious choking, made Mick's body suddenly stiffen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I love you, and I want to live with you and our child... I'm sorry, I'm sorry... I underestimated your love for me, and I was too arrogant, thinking that your love for me wasn't that deep!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She kept apologizing, tears rolling down her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not saying this out of pity or because I'm moved. I love you. When we separated, I had already fallen in love with you. It's just that at that time... I was too slow to tell you about my feelings for you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy murmured, "And now, I'm still too slow. I'm sorry for not telling you earlier that I love you. I don't just care about our child. I'm just... not sure how long I'll live, so I'm afraid to express my feelings to you. If I had known that you loved me so much, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">More and more tears streamed down her face, blurring her vision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her tear-streaked face and listened to her choked voice telling him how much she loved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was he dreaming again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was he still in a dream, hearing such beautiful words from her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the tears he touched with his fingers were so warm and wet, so real!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really... love me?" Mick wiped Nancy's tears with his fingers, bent down, and looked at her straight in the eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I love you very much. That's why I don't want to watch you die with me no matter what. I will live, with you and our child!" Nancy said, taking the initiative to wrap her arms around his neck and kiss him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She loved him so much that words alone couldn't express it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She could only use this kiss to tell him how deep her feelings for him were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her feelings for him started with guilt and using him, but unconsciously, they turned into liking and love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was willing to jump off the cliff not just because of her guilt, but also because she wanted to repay him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">More than anything, it's because she loves him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't want him to be caught in a dilemma, burdened with guilt. She wanted to help him protect his loved ones, so she could jump off the cliff without any regrets!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mick, I love you!" She kissed him deeply and repeated those words over and over again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her breath was on his nose, and her warmth was on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was completely enamored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you ever lie to me again, I will never forgive you," he said hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't, I won't lie to you again!" She whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All her doubts and struggles were put aside. In this moment, she and he were so intimate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their hearts had never been so close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought that for the rest of her life, she would be entangled with this man. They would accompany each other, grow old together, and love each other forever...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, Nancy followed the doctor's advice and had a caesarean section at 32 weeks to save both the baby and herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she felt guilty about the decision she made for her unborn child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctor comforted her, "With the advancement of medical technology, premature babies born at 8 months can be very healthy with proper treatment and care. However, once the baby is born, you will need to undergo surgery immediately, which is the biggest challenge."</p></div>
