        <h1>Chapter 1977</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I understand that. I understand!" said Mrs. Watts as her nasal voice broke a little. "I'm content with the ways things are now. I... I don't expect Jason to forgive me and see me. I know it's already the biggest compromise for him to spare me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts patted his wife on the shoulder and comforted her. "Alright, don't be upset. Grace brought her kids to see you today. That's something to be happy about!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes... Yes, it's a happy occasion!" Mrs. Watts immediately said and cheered up. "I'm going to make the kids some delicious food and take them to some interesting places in L City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The three children had very different personalities. Jasper and Mrs. Watts were the closest, so she kept clinging to Mrs. Watts. Meanwhile, the boys Mick Reed and Mason, remained silent in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Of course, strictly speaking, Mick Reed was watching Mason. Mason looked totally dazed, seemingly indifferent to everything around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace knew that Mason was different from ordinary children because of what he had experienced in his childhood. She could only be patient as it would take time for his condition to improve. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the evening, Mason reached out his hand to Grace and uttered two words. "Video call."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace immediately understood that the little one wanted to call the sister he was not related to, Veronica Barlow, so she said, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She said as she took out a phone and video called Veronica Barlow. Grace had bought Veronica Barlow a phone and would pay for the phone bills, so the little girl need not worry about the mobile data.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Mason saw Veronica Barlow on the video, his expressionless face immediately came alive. Although his expression still did not change much, his eyes seemed to sparkle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at the changes in Mason somewhat emotionally. To Mason, Veronica Barlow was the only person willing to protect him. She was also the only one who treated him well in the past few years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was like imprinting in animals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was no telling what would happen to the children. Every time Mason called Veronica Barlow &lsquo;Sis&rsquo;, it reminded her of her past with Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wondered if the two children would fall in love when they grew up. Looking at the current situation, Mason probably regarded Veronica as his one and only. However, Veronica... probably simply regarded Mason as her younger brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">One-sided persistence was the worst in relationships. If Veronica Barlow did not fall in love with Mason, would Mason be willing to let her go?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace felt worried and then burst into laughter. 'What am I thinking? The kids are still young. They have no idea what romance is.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Perhaps the two children think of each other as siblings. Perhaps they&rsquo;ll become boyfriend and girlfriend in the future or they&rsquo;ll grow apart as they age.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The future was a long way to go, and who could be sure of what would happen? She was worrying too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm going to do my homework. Mason, be a good boy. Do whatever aunt Cummins says. I bought some chocolate that my classmates said was delicious today. We'll share it when you come back!" said Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, I'll be good," said Mason, looking just like a gentle sheep. One could not imagine that he had beaten a group of older children to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After ending the video call with Veronica Barlow, Mason returned the phone to Grace. Then, he obediently climbed into bed, pulled the covers over him, and lay down as if preparing to go to sleep.</p></div>
