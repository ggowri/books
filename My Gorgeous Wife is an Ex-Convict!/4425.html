        <h1>Chapter 4423: Always Giving Him Hope</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the report didn't specify that Mr. Elledge is Calvert's father.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, some people online still dug up this connection, and the matter of Calvert previously refusing to pay off his father's gambling debts also became a hot topic among netizens.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people think that gambling debts shouldn't be repaid because it's like throwing money into a bottomless pit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But some people think that Calvert is already quite wealthy. What's the big deal about helping his father pay off gambling debts? After all, it's because those debts weren't settled that his father ended up getting killed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are all sorts of discussions going on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was worried that Calvert would be upset by those comments, so he didn't let him look at his phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, if I can't even handle this much, how am I supposed to face others in the future?" Calvert said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These past few years in the entertainment industry have really toughened up his ability to handle pressure!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley finally handed his phone to Calvert, but he still watched him carefully while he was looking at it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert stared blankly at his phone, reading the comments about his father. After a long while, he finally said, "Maybe this is a kind of relief for both him and me. He was a lifelong gambler, and this end... it seems like the kind of fate a gambler would meet."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley could feel the contradictions filling his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now... he's gone, and I don't have a single relative by my side," he said despondently.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mother had left when he was very young, and there had been no word from her since. Now, with his father's death, he truly felt like an orphan.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No relatives!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he used to hate his father, deep down he always felt that he still had family in this world.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, I'm your family!" Harley embraced Calvert as he spoke.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hugged her tightly, knowing she would always be by his side, warming him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days later, the police called Calvert to tell him that they had found the culprit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, it wasn't the people he owed money to, but someone who had just been released from prison. He got into a heated argument with Mr. Elledge and, in a moment of impulse, committed the crime.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert had no intention of meeting the criminal face-to-face; he simply instructed to handle it as deemed appropriate.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He also collected his father's body from the police and found a burial plot to lay his father to rest.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the day of his father's funeral, only Harley was by his side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the photo of his father on the tombstone, Calvert felt like his father had accomplished nothing in his life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's somewhat funny, yet also a bit sad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after his death, there were only two people standing by this grave, watching him being buried!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long while, he murmured, "Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley followed Calvert, and together they walked out of the cemetery.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvert, let's get married in three years!" Harley suddenly said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Calvert was stunned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm saying, let's get married in three years. I want to have several kids. I hope that your family can keep growing!" she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's eyes suddenly reddened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does she even know what she's talking about?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm serious, so just tell me, are you willing?" Harley interrupted him, looking into his eyes with earnestness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Choking up, he took a moment before his hoarse voice came through, "I'm willing!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, of course he's willing. How could he possibly not be?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is the person he loves most, always giving him hope! Making him realize that this world is so wonderful!</span></p></div>
