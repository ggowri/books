        <h1>Chapter 1612</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Adopted?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, they&rsquo;re a complicated family. The man's wife died and he had a daughter of his own. He remarried and they had a son but they suddenly adopted another child. Isn't it strange? He already had two children of his own but still adopted a child unrelated to him," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Many people in the neighborhood knew about it and so did she. She had lived here for years, after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's heart ached again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is the child not biologically related to the family in any way? Then it must be hard for him in that family. He might have gotten kicked out if he didn't have his sister protecting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Where will he go if that family kicks him out? A welfare home? Will he have to wait for the next family to adopt him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Grace also knew that the younger the child was, the better. This child was already old enough to remember things. Besides, he did not have a pleasant character. It would probably be difficult for him to be adopted by a good family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll go and check on the child," said Grace as she walked out of the store and headed toward the tiny figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could not explain why she cared so much about the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe the child's eyes and expression reminded her of the first time she saw Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace walked up to the boy, only to see him looking just like when she first saw him in the amusement park. There was no expression on his pretty little face, and even his eyes were empty. He was only staring at the school past the gates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mason." Grace crouched down and said to the little one, "Are you waiting for your sister?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The word &lsquo;sister&rsquo; seemed to garner a reaction from the little one. His eyes moved, and he looked at Grace. He nodded his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you very fond of your sister?" she asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one nodded his head again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace smiled. "I like your sister too. Your sister is very protective of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I like Sis." The three words escaped the little one's mouth. The childlike voice spoke with a little difficulty. It was as if he usually spoke very little, so he was not that fluent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace raised her hand to touch the little one's head, but he quickly moved his head to the side and avoided Grace's hand. His expressionless face seemed a little more guarded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's hand missed, but she did not feel any displeasure. She only said, "I just like you very much. I saw you in the amusement park... the other day. I saw you fighting the other kids for your sister and then you... Did your parents blame you after that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She weighed her words. After all, though the child was adopted, the couple was his adoptive parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Later, Jay told her that he had taken care of the matter. He paid for all the injured boys' medical bills and their parents promised not to pursue the matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Grace did not know whether the adoptive parents gave the child a hard time after the incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one paid no attention to Grace but turned to the gate and stared at the school behind it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, one by one, parents came to pick up their children. The crowd at the school gate grew.</p></div>
