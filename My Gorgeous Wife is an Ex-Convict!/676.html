        <h1>Chapter 675</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay lifted her chin. "I'm not afraid to tell you honestly that I was moved when I learned Brian has been looking for me for so many years. I'm already divorced anyway, so it's all right for me to pursue my happiness. I know Brian and you used to know each other, and I've also heard from Brian that he thought you were me for a while, but you're not me, are you? Therefore, I hope you'll mind your words and deeds. It's better for everyone that way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay was dressed by a professional stylist these days. Even though she looked ordinary, she could still look like a starlet. Naturally, this had given Stella Lindsay a lot of confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only felt that she had looked normal before because she did not dress up. As long as she dressed up, she was no less attractive than Brian's former girlfriends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Stella Lindsay stared at Grace, saying, "I hope you won't get in the way of my happiness, Grace. Otherwise, I won't show you any mercy even if we're relatives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not allow anyone to get in her way. She would seize the chance and be on top of the hierarchy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a similar dream... In the dream, the little boy's face was still blurry, but in the dream, she grabbed his hand with difficulty. The two kids almost used up all their strength to climb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a steep slope. If they slipped and fell, then even if they were not dead, they would be seriously injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little boy's body shook in exhaustion while the little girl continued to encourage him. "I won't let go. With a little more effort, you'll be able to climb up. I&hellip; I&rsquo;ll take you up there. Don't lose heart!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure you won't let go?" the little boy asked timidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," the little girl said with great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several times, the two little figures were in danger of sliding down the hill. Finally, when the little girl dragged the little boy back to safety, both of them nearly collapsed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Look, I told you I'd get you up here!" the little girl said with a grin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little boy was so tired that he lay down on the dirt. "I... I can't walk anymore..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, we must hurry down, or the bad guys will catch up!" The little girl urged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two children stood up with difficulty, but when the little boy stood, he suddenly let out a cry of pain. Then, his whole body fell heavily on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter, Bryn? Bryn..." The little girl rushed forward nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Bryn..." A moan spilled out of Grace's mouth while she was still asleep. Next to her, Jason's pupils constricted immediately. His eyes stared at her lips while he listened to the words that made him tremble. "Bryn... What happened to you? Are you all right..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's thin lips curled into a straight line as his body began to tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The trembling was so great that he could not stop it even if he tried. A suffocating fear enveloped him instantly, making it difficult for him to breathe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What is she... Dreaming about? Why did she cry out the word 'Bryn'?'</p></div>
