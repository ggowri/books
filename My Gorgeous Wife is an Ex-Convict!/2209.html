        <h1>Chapter 2207</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla declined but failed, so she gave Jacqueline Bowman her address. Jacqueline Bowman drove to Kyla's place half an hour later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was a hint of shock on her face when she saw Kyla's store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you&hellip; run this store? Do you live here?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I've run it for years. Nelson studies in the primary school next door. It's easier for me to take care of my child this way," replied Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was quite friendly to Jacqueline Bowman after learning that she was her daughter's fellow inmate and had helped her when she was in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She poured Jacqueline Bowman tea, cut some fruits, and brought out a lot of snacks for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Bowman, why don't you stay for dinner later? What do you like to eat? I'll go to the market to buy the ingredients," said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I'll leave after a short chat. I just wanted to keep in touch with Kyla since it wasn&rsquo;t easy for us to run into each other again," said Jacqueline Bowman. However, her heart was full of disdain for this shabby place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tea and snacks Mrs. Corbyn had prepared were hard for Jacqueline Bowman to swallow. In her opinion, they were all cheap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She came here today to find out what was with the luxury car Kyla got into yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Mrs. Corbyn left to work on her things, Jacqueline Bowman pretended to ask Kyla casually, "By the way, I happened to see you getting picked up in a car when I left the hospital yesterday. I thought of giving you a ride at first. Who picked you up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a chauffeur for someone I know. I'm pregnant, so they were worried that the bus would be too crowded. That&rsquo;s why they asked their chauffeur to pick me up. But it only happens once in a while," said Kyla. She had told the chauffeur yesterday to tell Martin Weiss that she would take a taxi for future check-ups, so he did not have to send anyone to pick her up anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman said curiously, "I see. Then who was the one who sent their chauffeur to pick you up? The car I saw yesterday was no ordinary car. That person must be rich."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked it up online yesterday and learned that even the lowest specifications for the car model she saw yesterday would cost more than three million dollars!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated, not wanting to mention Martin Weiss. Hence, she only spoke vaguely, "Maybe they're quite well off..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Could the person be the father of your child?" asked Jacqueline Bowman. She knew she got it right when she saw Kyla's expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was now more convinced that Kyla was a wealthy man&rsquo;s mistress, just like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla seemed to be worse off than her. At least she lived in a high-end apartment, and the wealthy man gave her 100,000 dollars as an allowance every month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'All Kyla has is a store like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But then again, I'm younger and prettier than Kyla, so I can get better things than her,' Jacqueline Bowman thought to herself. However, she was still smiling. "Why don't you call your man out sometime? I'll call mine out too. We can have a meal together and perhaps they can score some business deals!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman thought that a man who could afford a car that cost three million dollars must be a somebody. Her man would treat her better if she could help him build some connections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla refused and said, "No, I have nothing to do with that man. And I don't like such social engagements."</p></div>
