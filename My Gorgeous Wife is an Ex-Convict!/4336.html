        <h1>Chapter 4334 Beautiful Eyes</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the day of the birthday banquet, Harley, dressed in a water-ink blue dress, followed his parents to the banquet venue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she followed her mother and watched her father carefully leading her forward, while her mother limped, a surge of emotion surged in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her memory, her father never despised her mother's lameness and even took more care of her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And from childhood to adulthood, she always heard a voice saying, 'How can someone like my mother deserve such a perfect father? Sooner or later, my father will dump my mother and find a more suitable woman!'!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But over the years, the father's love for his mother has been increasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Love has never been born out of matching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She envies her parents' love, but also feels sad about her own love. She loves Lornell, but Lornell chose her only because of her perfect match?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of her identity, she was worthy of the Quentin family, so when he chose to save her, he directly said he wanted her to be his fianc&eacute;e.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for so many years, he did not gradually fall in love with her, and his attitude towards her remained unchanged for so many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I don't like it, but I don't dislike it either, it's like just treating an ordinary acquaintance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this kind of engagement really what she wants?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Entering the arena, the parents arrived in front of the Quentin family and began chatting with each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Harley also saw Lornell, dressed in a black suit and paired with a white shirt. Even though it was just an ordinary color scheme, wearing it on him highlighted his indifferent yet mysterious temperament even more clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, it also attracted the attention of many young women around it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though this birthday banquet was not planned for a grand occasion, the Quentin family already had a wide network of people, coupled with their excellent medical skills, many people wanted to please the Quentin family, so they naturally found a way to attend this banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there is more than one woman who is interested in Lornell among them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Lornell walked forward after seeing Harley and said, "You're here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm. "She responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You look very beautiful today, "Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley smiled slightly and said, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he was praising her for her beauty, there was no ripple in his eyes, just an ordinary routine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they chatted, Harley's gaze unconsciously remained on Lornell's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why does she love him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it because he saved her in a moment of kindness when he was a child? Or is it because of his appearance, which happens to be the type she likes? That's why she's attracted to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially his eyes, she still remembers how beautiful they were when she first saw them when she was a child!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that after watching it for a long time, one will become addicted to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, another pair of eyes flashed through her mind, one of the few that could surprise her, beautiful and profound, with a melancholic feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's Calvert's eyes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only saw each other twice, but didn't really see their appearance, because each time, they were beaten black and blue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only thing I can see clearly is the other person's eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you thinking? "Lornell's voice suddenly rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley suddenly regained his senses!</span></p></div>
