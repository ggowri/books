        <h1>Chapter 1520</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The restaurant still had to operate, so when the police came, they escorted the five of them involved into their police cars. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the police car, Irene Lynch could not help but freeze when she heard the name Grace told the police. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace? This woman&rsquo;s name was also Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Was that not the name of Young master Reed's deceased wife?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, however, Irene Lynch did not associate Grace with Jason's wife. Jason's wife had passed away five years ago, after all. That was common knowledge in tMason Swansonty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch only thought that the Grace in front of her was utterly ridiculous for thinking that she could suck up to Young master Reed just because her name was also Grace. How dare she shamelessly let a child mistake Young master Reed as her father?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In this world, not everyone was qualified to call Young master Reed their father!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the future, except for the youngest master of the Reed family, Mick Reed, only her daughter, Wanna, would have the right to!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, Jasper was still hung up on the torn half of the photo. That was a photo of her daddy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"C&rsquo;mon, don't be sad. Mommy will take you to see Daddy today. When we do... Uh, you can take your own camera and take pictures of Daddy," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper thought about it, and suddenly, her previous gloom was cleared away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's my daddy, not your daddy! And Daddy doesn't like being photographed the most!" Oriel Lynch said unhappily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hmph, Mommy said that Daddy will like me a lot because I look like Mommy! Daddy likes Mommy the most!" Jasper said defiantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina came up to her friend's ear and said, "Did you really say that to Jasper?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mm." Grace&rsquo;s face could not help but blush a little. Well, she had indeed said such cheeky words to her daughter as she had been obsessing over whether her dad would like her or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It&rsquo;s been five years since I last met you and you&rsquo;ve grown up, huh?" Lina snickered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch coldly snorted. "Shamelessness can really be hereditary. Like mother, like daughter. I would eat a shoe if Young master Reed ends up liking a woman like you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I&rsquo;ll wait for you to eat your shoe, then!" Lina egged her on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Irene Lynch felt like she would explode from anger thanks to Lina. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car drove to the police station in a short time. The group of people got out of the car. Irene Lynch's lawyer was already waiting at the entrance of the police station. As soon as he saw Irene Lynch, he hurried over. "Miss Lynch, you can rest assured that there&rsquo;ll be no problem with this lawsuit. We can definitely&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before he could finish his words, his eyes inadvertently glanced at Grace who got down from the car with Irene Lynch. He suddenly froze. "You are... Lawyer Cummins?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, it's been a long time, Lawyer Li." Grace smiled. When she was still with her mentor, she had met Lawyer Li before at an event hosted by the Lawyers&rsquo; Association in a foreign province.</p></div>
