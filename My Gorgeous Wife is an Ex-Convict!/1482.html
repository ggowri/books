        <h1>Chapter 1481</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Grace wants to have dinner with me on Chinese New Year's Eve. That means she won't leave me, right?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Knock, knock! Suddenly there was a knock on the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Come in," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence walked in and said to Jason, "Master Reed, Lily has escaped!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's expression changed instantly, and his black eyes stared at Terrence. "What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"According to the police, Lily escaped at around three in the morning. The detention center's surveillance system was hacked, so it didn&rsquo;t capture anything at that time. We don't know who helped Lily escape," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was silent. 'Is it the Atkinson family? Or the Stevens family? Or a crazy but competent fan of Lily&rsquo;s? Or&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Keep an eye on the Atkinson family and the Stevens family. See what they're up to. Also, keep looking for Secretary Wang. Whatever it takes, find him as soon as possible!" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could not rest easy until he found Secretary Wang. He kept feeling as if something was about to happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Could Secretary Wang's disappearance have something to do with Grandpa? Did Old Master Reed... order Secretary Wang to do something?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would only know once he <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>found Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Chinese New Year's Eve came, Grace finally saw Jason again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was wearing a black coat. His black hair was combed back, and his delicate features seemed more defined. There was an air of elegance around his tall and straight body, but the scarf and mittens he was wearing seemed to be a little out of place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace recognized the scarf and mittens. She had knitted them for him a year before. She had taken apart an old sweater and knitted them into a scarf and a pair of mittens for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Why are you staring at me?" he asked as he walked up to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No... Nothing. I'm just... surprised you'd wear the scarf and mittens," said Grace. As soon as he approached her, she recalled what she had heard on the stairs that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She told herself to stop thinking about it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You knitted these for me. Of course, I'll wear them," he said as he took off his scarf, mittens, and coat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His hand almost subconsciously wanted to touch her but stopped in mid-air. He hesitated for a moment before pulling it back to his side, saying, "Okay, get some rest while I prepare New Year's Eve dinner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You?" Grace was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The chefs are here too. I'll just be helping a little," he said. Although he could have prepared the entire New Year's Eve dinner himself, his skills could not be compared to the chefs'. He could only help, but he would prepare the dessert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was a little stunned as she watched Jason walk into the kitchen, put on an apron, and roll up his sleeves. He began to prepare and cook with the chefs in the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her eyes instantly reddened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'He's a good husband and will be a good father. Don't I already know that? Don't I?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She sat on the couch in the living room, thinking about the times they had spent together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Jason walked out of the kitchen, he only saw Grace asleep on the couch, covered with a blanket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The couch was large enough so she would not fall off in her sleep. Besides, the caregiver was beside her.</p></div>
