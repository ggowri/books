        <h1>Chapter 1586</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Simona Menzie covered her face and looked at her father in disbelief. "Dad, I was right. I&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How dare you say such things? Who do you think you are to have her explain to you?" Mr. Menzie snapped, thinking that his daughter was going to ruin the Menzie family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, what Jason said next seemed to confirm Mr. Menzie's speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It seems that the Menzie family is indeed getting a little ahead of themselves. I'll have the company reconsider our cooperation." His cold voice rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mr. Menzie went stiff. As if Jason had lost interest in this matter, he said to Grace, "Are your feet feeling any better?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, they are," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then let&rsquo;s get something to eat. You haven't had much to eat tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay." Now that he had brought it up, Grace did feel hungry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason took Grace's hand and went to the dining area. Mr. Menzie gave his daughter another slap and said bitterly, "Great! You've ruined the Menzie family, you dumb*ss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Simona Menzie's cheeks were red and swollen. She covered her cheeks, looking like a mess. She was not as well-dressed and beautiful as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The other members of high society slowly dispersed as if they had enough of the show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, people now understood that Mrs. Reed was not an easy target after the commotion Simona Menzie caused. Even though she had left for five years, she was still the mistress of the Reed family and doted on by Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson appeared to be deep in thought. Then, she looked up at Hadwin Stephenson and said with a slight smile, "It seems that Grace is quite capable. Even after being missing for five years, Jason's feelings for her haven't changed. It looks like the Menzie family will be kicked out from Emerald City's high society."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Katherine Jackson, you don't know what love is," Hadwin Stephenson said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really? If I knew nothing about love, I wouldn't have spent the last five years with you. Or are you trying to say that your feelings for Lina haven't changed?" asked Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was silent. If she knew what love was, she would understand it was difficult to love another if you had really loved someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The person he loved had always been Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His silence only fuelled Katherine Jackson's determination to get him. "Hadwin Stephenson, you'll fall in love with me one day. You&rsquo;ll come to realize that Lina doesn't deserve to stand by your side!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She doesn't deserve it?' Hadwin Stephenson only found it ridiculous. He was the one who did not deserve to be with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was the one who no longer deserved to stand by Lina's side!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On the other side of the banquet, Patrick looked at Brian and said, "I thought you were going to rush over and be a hero who saved the beauty, but you didn&rsquo;t do anything. What's the matter? Have you really gotten over her this time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian smiled lightly. "She can solve it herself without me running over." Grace was different now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Though she was strong, she would not necessarily fight back in the face of other people's attacks. She only got tough when they crossed the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even if Jason had not shown up, she would have crushed the woman who intended to pick on her so hard that she would not have been able to fight back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was now stronger and more courageous than before. It would not be easy for others to bully her even if they wanted to.</p></div>
