        <h1>Chapter 3205</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, do you want it or not?" Jason's voice rang out again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." William shifted his lips, feeling like all the words were stuck in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course William wants to find him too!" Jasper interrupted, then turned excitedly to William and said, "William, when we find that boy, let's listen to him play the piano together so you can understand what I mean by 'flavor'! And then we can play the piano together, it'll be so much fun!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's bright eyes sparkled like stars, and his hopeful expression made William's uncomfortable feeling grow stronger, as if he would lose her if that boy was found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he couldn't bring himself to say no, because he didn't want to see her disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So he could only say, "Um, of course...I also hope we can find him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I knew it!" Jasper raised his chin triumphantly and looked at his dad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason smiled slightly, "Then I'll find this boy and let him play the piano for Jasper and you all again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Dad!" Jasper immediately showed a brilliant smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace looked at her husband disapprovingly and asked when the nanny took the children to another part of the banquet hall, "Do you really want to help Jasper find that boy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why not? Since Jasper wants to hear that boy play the piano again, what harm is there in fulfilling our daughter's small wish?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But William, he..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He just said it earlier, didn't he? He also hopes to find that boy," Jason chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You clearly know that the child is not genuinely willing!" Grace said. She could even see through William's thoughts, and she didn't believe he couldn't see it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, he wasn't really willing, but since he said those things to Jasper, he should bear the consequences, shouldn't he?" Jason said. "If he can't handle this, then there will only be more things he can't handle in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper nodded in agreement, "I understand what you mean. It's important to take responsibility for our words and actions, even if we don't really mean them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason smiled, "Exactly. It's all about being accountable and honest with ourselves and others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace sighed, feeling sorry for William, even though his mother was Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The culprit who once framed her and caused her to be imprisoned, but this child is innocent!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, although this child grew up with Lily, he did not develop any bad thoughts. In fact, he was once bullied because his mother was a criminal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace knows what it feels like to be bullied, so she feels even more sorry for William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, as for the children's affairs, they will solve them on their own in the future. Right now, they are still young, we have to wait for them to be troubled by matters of the heart, at least for another 7-8 years." Seeing the worried expression on his wife's face, Jason started to console her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grace said, 'I hope William and Jasper will be well in the future.' As a mother, she realized that the older her children grew, the more she had endless worries."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason didn't say much. For him, the only things that mattered were Grace and their children. As for William, he was actually insignificant to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first, the Reed family took in William simply because Jasper liked him. To William, he was nothing more than Jasper's toy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, naturally, he wouldn't care about what will happen to a toy in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He just wants his daughter to be well and happy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Jasper ends up liking William in the future, then no matter what, he will help his daughter get him! If Jasper doesn't like William, then he naturally has a way to make William lose interest!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the wedding reception, Philip and William returned to their hotel.</p></div>
