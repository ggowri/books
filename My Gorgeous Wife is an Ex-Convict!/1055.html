        <h1>Chapter 1054</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. A long while passed before she murmured, "I don't..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had only started speaking when he pressed his fingers against her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cool fingers that were pressed against her lips stopped her from going on, and there was a hint of pleading in his phoenix eyes. "Stop it, won't you? At least not in this gown."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace trembled and did not go on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let's go. It won&rsquo;t be easy for you to get a cab here with you dressed like this," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thanked him and walked with Brian in the direction of the gala's exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as they approached the exit, they saw some security guards not far away who seemed to be talking about something. A few of them were talking nervously on their walkie-talkies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if something had happened!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned and asked, "What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Someone&hellip; Someone suddenly cleared the area outside and had people barricade the place," answered a security guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was stunned. Today's charity gala was jointly organized by the Hart family and several other large companies in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If someone wanted to make trouble, their actions were tantamount to making themselves an enemy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those who dared to do this in Emerald City... "Who cleared the area?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The security guards looked at each other, apparently unaware.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of the security guards, who was on the phone with someone else, ended their conversation and rushed over to Brian. With a pale face, he said, "Young Master Hart, it's Master Reed who's clearing the area!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'There's only one person in Emerald City called Master Reed!' Brian's eyes darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason? Jason wants to clear the area?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is Jason suddenly doing this? Could it be&hellip;' Brian's eyes went to Grace who was beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace also heard the guard's words. Her face had turned pale as well. She never expected Jason to be the one to clear the area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The exit was only a few steps away. When Grace got to the gates, she could only see that there were not as many reporters as before. Now, she could hardly see any reporters. There were only a group of people in black uniforms surrounding the area!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's such a big fuss to surround and clear the area. What is Jason trying to do?' Grace thought to herself, but she could not think of an answer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She slowly caught sight of a figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's pupils shrunk as she stiffened. Her eyes were fixed on the figure getting out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's really... Jason!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was wearing a dark gray suit over a thin black turtleneck sweater. His handsome face looked especially cold and solemn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the moonlight, he wore his hair slicked back, revealing his forehead. His tall nose and sexy thin lips were exquisite. At this moment, his bright eyes were looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's looking at me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt as though her blood was freezing little by little.</p></div>
