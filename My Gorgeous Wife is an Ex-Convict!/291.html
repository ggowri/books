        <h1>Chapter 290</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The huge room was as cool as water at night. It was so cold that one could catch a cold!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Evelyn got home, she heard that her mother had been dismissed from her job and that her father was also demoted from a supervisor to a regular employee!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can this be?" Evelyn said in surprise. Both of her parents worked in the public sector, and in this sector, as long as one did not make any mistakes, they would not get demoted at all, let alone fired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she was still Brian's girlfriend! Even if the head of the sector wanted to fire and demote her parents, they should also consider that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you tell your superiors that I'm now Brian's girlfriend?" Evelyn said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We did. Of course, we did." At the mention of this, Melinda Riley became very angry. She had told her boss that her daughter was the entertainment industry's prince's girlfriend and that in the future, she would marry into a rich and powerful family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Melinda Riley&rsquo;s boss ignored her and only said, "No matter who your daughter's boyfriend is, you have to leave today. There's no room for discussion!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It really pissed her off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought there would be more! She never stopped showing off to her colleagues that her daughter was involved with the entertainment industry's prince. When they saw her packing up her things after getting laid off, the colleagues who had once cozied up to her were now making fun of her downfall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of her colleagues, whom she often pressured, even ran up to her and said, "Oh, Cuie, isn't your daughter Brian's girlfriend? Even if you lose your job, your daughter can fully support you! I just don't know how long these days will last. I heard that Brian changes his girlfriends very quickly. If becoming his girlfriend means that one can marry into a rich family, just think of how many wives Brian must have!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, several of her colleagues made self-righteous second opinions, giving suggestions as if they were in her best interests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Ask your daughter to get as much as she can now, Cuie. She may not get the chance after a few months."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it that easy to marry into such a rich and powerful family? Your daughter is not a socialite. The more rich and powerful the family, the more likely the wife has to be of equal social status."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she knew that these people were not making friendly suggestions. They were mocking her! She had shown off too much. How could these colleagues not step on her face now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When Brian marries you, I must go back to shove it in their faces and show them that I can be Brian's mother-in-law! I&rsquo;ll like to see what they&rsquo;ll say then!" Melinda Riley said furiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn felt a pang of guilt. If it had been before, she would have agreed with her mother, but now... She was by no means certain of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days, Brian only talked to her about her sister. It was as if he was not interested to listen to anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been racking her brains to think of all sorts of things to say about her sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even now, she did not understand what Brian saw in her sister! She was just a street sweeper, right? What was there to know?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Tony Cummins said, "What's wrong with our family? I don't think we've offended anyone. How can all our jobs go wrong at the same time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn suddenly shuddered, turning white in the face. She said, "It can't be because of Sis. Dad burned the photo album that day... Could it be that she complained to Jason, so Jason took matters in his hands and attacked our family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more they thought about it, the more likely it was. Otherwise, normal people would have cared that she was Brian's girlfriend and not dared to harm her family.</p></div>
