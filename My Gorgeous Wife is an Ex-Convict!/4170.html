        <h1>Chapter 4168 Buying Hot Searches</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even Tina, who was used to Chandler's behavior, was stunned by his devout prayer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In that moment, she found it almost impossible to take her eyes off him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When Chandler stood up and looked at Tina, she suddenly snapped back to reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What's wrong?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I didn't expect you to kneel and bow. I thought you didn't believe," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler smiled faintly, his smile melting away his usual coldness. "Since it's said that the more sincere the heart, the stronger the bond, let's make our bond even stronger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina couldn't help but embrace Chandler. How could she not love a man like him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After leaving the temple of Cupid, Tina took Chandler to the Marriage Hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Here, various marriage-related merchandise is sold, and many couples come here for good luck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina spotted a string of bracelets made of alternating white crystal and red agate. They looked quite nice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And the meaning was quite good - "Eternal unity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What do you think of this bracelet?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It's nice," Chandler replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Then let's buy two strings and each wear one," she said with great interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It would be nice to wear couple bracelets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He gently said, "Okay." His eyes were full of fondness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina bought two strings of bracelets, and they each wore one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The bracelets were slightly more feminine, and Tina looked at Chandler in his neat suit, wearing such a bracelet on his wrist. It gave off a feeling of mismatch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But Chandler didn't think it was inappropriate at all. On the contrary, his lips curved into a shallow smile. "I hope this bracelet can really make us stay united forever!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Of course it will!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just then, a internet celebrity next to them was filming a dancing video. Many onlookers were taking photos. Among them, someone was taking photos and stepping backwards, about to collide with Tina. Chandler quickly raised his hand to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was already quite tall among girls, but being protected like this by Chandler, her whole body was almost engulfed in his embrace, giving off a delicate feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Be careful!" Chandler warned the person who was stepping back and taking photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Y-yes, sorry," the person quickly apologized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This was originally just a small incident, but Tina didn't expect that it would become a hot topic the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The moment when Chandler protected her was captured and uploaded online, along with the scene of Chandler devoutly kneeling and bowing to Cupid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> At first, people were discussing Chandler's handsome appearance and boyfriend material.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Then someone started digging into Chandler's identity and discovered that he was the CEO of the Hunter Group, and the financial and political power behind him was difficult to estimate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Furthermore, someone pointed out that the woman Chandler protected was Tina, the heiress of the White Maple Group and Chandler's fianc&eacute;e.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Suddenly, the popularity soared and eventually became a hot search.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Of course, Tina also contributed to this hot search. Seeing the popularity, Tina decided to buy another hot search, indicating that the two of them are about to get married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler looked at the hot search Tina bought and couldn't help but cry and laugh, "You bought a hot search?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes," Tina nodded candidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why did you buy a hot search?" he asked.</p></div>
