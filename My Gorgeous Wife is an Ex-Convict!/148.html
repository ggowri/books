        <h1>Chapter 147</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her body trembled continuously as she vomited. Only when she felt as if she had vomited to the point of collapse and could not throw up any more bile did she slowly raise her head to glance out of the washroom.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man's tall silhouette stood right outside the washroom, his handsome face shrouded with a layer of gloom.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His dark eyes stared at her coldly. "Are you that disgusted by me?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her face was pale and she curled up her body as if she were trying to put a thousand miles of distance between them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason pursed his lips tightly. "When have I ever had to desire a woman like this? I'm Jason. What kind of woman can't I have in Emerald City?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And she's just an ordinary woman. Even if she's slightly interesting... I won't lower myself to chasing a woman who is so disgusted by me."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"All right, Grace. Since you're so disgusted, I'll let you leave," Jason said coldly. His beautiful and amorous eyes were cold with frost. "However, that being said, if you regret it in the future, I won't ever want you again. I, Jason, never give anyone a second chance."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he was done talking, he turned to leave the ward.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace propped herself up with her arms over the sink, seemingly using up all of her energy just to not slump to the floor.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Does this mean... I can leave the hospital?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She rearranged her torn clothes and combed her hair, then looked at her pale self in the mirror, unable to help smiling wryly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Grace left the hospital, she was suddenly surrounded by a group of people.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's her! That's the Grace who killed someone!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh my god! She really is staying in this hospital! She killed someone and I heard she was only in prison for three years before being released. Three years for a human life. She got off too easy!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Lily was sad for a long period of time over the death of her sister all those years ago! Lily was sad all because of her! She caused Lily to lose her sister!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not only were they slandering Grace, they were also throwing rotten vegetables and stinky eggs at her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though Grace tried hard to dodge them, she was still struck by a large amount of waste.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Furthermore, there were reporters nearby taking pictures of her as if they were producing a news report.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In a black Bentley parked not far away, Terrence noticed that Grace was in an embarrassing situation. He then turned to look at Jason, who was sitting in the backseat silently with a cold expression on his face, and he could not help asking, "Mr. Reed, should I go help Miss Cummins?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No need," Jason replied coldly. "Since she's not willing to stay by my side then she should understand that she needs to endure this."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"These people must be Miss Lily's fans. They probably saw the news that had been published online about Miss Cummins being hospitalized here. That's why they're here at the hospital entrance intercepting Miss Cummins," Terrence explained. He had looked into the motives of the people staking out the hospital.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This is actually an insignificant matter. I had never even considered that Grace would be unwilling to stay by Mr. Reed's side and try to leave the hospital all by herself.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Everyone knows that in Emerald City, there are many women who would love to stay by Mr. Reed's side, and yet Grace refused him!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence remained silent.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason studied the scene beyond the car windows with a cold expression. A moment later, it was as if he was too lazy to look any longer, so he gradually shut his eyes and ordered, "Let's go!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes," Terrence replied. The car slowly drove away from the hospital entrance. Terrence did not notice his boss's hands on his knees clenching repeatedly until they slowly formed into fists.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's... an extreme amount of restraint."</p></div>
