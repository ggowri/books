        <h1>Chapter 1318</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's my business, Martin Weiss. As long as you promise me these two things, I'll give you Nelson's custody!" She stepped back, putting distance between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you think of Nelson as a burden, why wait three months? I can take Nelson right now," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" She shouted the word from her throat in a sharp voice. It was as if someone was trying to take her life. "Martin Weiss, I only want three months with him. Can't you even give me three more months to be with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Three months?" he sneered, "Since you don't want your son anymore, why are you so persistent in demanding these three months?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lower lip tightly. Moments later, she said, "If you won't give me these three months, then... I'm not giving up custody."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her thoughtfully. "You came here to tell me these all of a sudden. Did you suddenly find someone to marry and want to start a new life? Is that why you've changed your mind and want to give up custody?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was silent and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her silence was tantamount to acquiescence to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he felt as if a thorn had pricked his heart, and it was growing longer and sharper, causing him constant pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you tell me who you've fallen for? Maybe I'll give you some money as a gift because you loved me so much and gave birth to Nelson," he said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, just tell me whether you agree to my terms. The rest are my personal matters. You don't have to bother with them." Kyla Corbyn took two more steps back to distance herself from him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his footsteps continued to approach her. Soon, he drove her against the wall. "Personal? Is the man you've fallen for as good as me? He probably doesn't know about your past and how you used to throw yourself at me in bed, right? He also doesn't know where you're sensitive and where you have moles... Why don't I tell him when I'm free?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Smack! A slap suddenly rang in the room. The air seemed to freeze at this instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face was slapped sideways, while Kyla Corbyn&rsquo;s hand was aching badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I just ... slapped him!' Kyla Corbyn held her hand tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, you wanted to get even with the Corbyn family because my father jeopardized your family, so you got back at me in your own way. I have nothing to say about that. I was silly to have fallen in love with you. I couldn't tell the difference between sincerity and insincerity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't blame anyone but myself for not having seen through you earlier. But I was sincere when I loved you. I loved you with all my heart and soul, so why would you insult me like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, you know what? By saying that, you're not only insulting me but also yourself. You never loved me and wanted to retaliate against me, but you still slept with me. What does that mean? Were you selling your body to get revenge? And I didn&rsquo;t even pay for it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She glared at him and spoke loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes darkened, and his thin lips were almost pressed into a straight line. It was obvious from the expression on his face that he was mad. However, when he heard Kyla Corbyn say, &lsquo;I loved you with all my heart and soul&rsquo;, a complicated gleam flashed in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, Kyla Corbyn's body shook. Her pretty eyebrows furrowed, and her face suddenly turned pale. She covered the upper right part of her abdomen with one hand while she bent slightly. Large drops of cold sweat began to appear on her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's come over you?" said Martin Weiss, recalling that he had seen her like this before.</p></div>
