        <h1>Chapter 3949</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because the game has not been released yet, they played it on the company's internal network.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy even had a special internal network account.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Regarding this, Nancy didn't know whether Mick really trusted her not to leak the game's content, or if he thought she didn't have the guts to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing a game, Nancy stretched her fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you think?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's really fun!" Nancy said, "This battle game can adapt to different levels of difficulty, and has a high degree of freedom. It tests the player's overall level. When this game is released, it will definitely be popular."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wasn't just flattering him, but telling the truth. Based on her gaming experience and the popular games on the market, the game Mick was developing had high playability and some innovative features that could attract players.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was asking about your hand," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Nancy was surprised that he asked this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My hand... um, it's nothing," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me see," Mick said, taking Nancy's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hand was held in his palm, and the size difference between their hands was striking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His hand seemed like it could easily envelop hers completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick kneaded Nancy's palm and fingers, and suddenly a painful sensation surged up, causing Nancy to groan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hadn't felt much before, but after being kneaded like this, her fingers felt a bit stiff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Bear with it," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't... don't knead it anymore, it's okay," she quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If your hands don't get enough relaxation, it can lead to chronic problems that will be harder to treat in the future," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy blinked. Wasn't that a bit exaggerated, chronic problems?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As if he could read her thoughts, he added, "Don't doubt it. Do you know how professional athletes get their occupational diseases?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I'm not a professional athlete," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your speed can rival that of a professional athlete," Mick praised generously, "but the faster your speed, the heavier the burden on your hands. If you don't want to suffer from hand pain when you're older, it's best to start protecting your hands now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned. Although Mick's voice was calm, his words showed that he was... concerned about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll give you a set of hand exercises for health next time, and you can follow the video to do them regularly," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, okay..." Nancy replied, but immediately after, her hands began to ache again, causing her to groan in pain, "Ouch...gentle, please!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He glanced at her with his beautiful peach blossom eyes, and his movements became lighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, despite this, she continued to moan in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he was still helping her, and she couldn't just pull her hand away. So Nancy's voice hardly stopped until the secretary walked into Mick's office with a group of high-level executives behind her, and her voice abruptly stopped.</p></div>
