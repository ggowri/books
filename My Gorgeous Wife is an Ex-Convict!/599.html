        <h1>Chapter 598</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was almost choked by his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not... Not..." she said with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace thought she might faint from lack of breath, a sudden gust of force yanked her out of Brian&rsquo;s arms. The next moment, she heard the pow of a punch in her ear. It was followed by a muffled snort, the sound of heavy objects falling, and the crash of chairs and shelves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath. Then, all she could see was Jason's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Jason who had yanked her out of Brian's arms! Grace stared blankly at Jason who was standing beside her, wondering why he was here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a gloomy face, Jason stared at Brian who had just been punched to the ground by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was now leaning uneasily against a row of shelves, surrounded by the mess from his crash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Blood trickled down the corner of his lips. It was obvious that Jason's punch had not been light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know what you're doing?" asked Jason with a ghastly pale face. His voice was as cold as the bone-chilling wind, and the mere sound of it would make an average person tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian met Jason's eyes with a smile on his face. "I know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know? You still did it when you knew? Do you want to turn the Hart family against the Reed family, Brian?" Jason said condescendingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian wiped the blood from his lips and slowly stood up. "Jason, you know I've been looking for someone, don&rsquo;t you? Grace could well be the one I'm looking for."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's pupils constricted suddenly. He stiffened in an instant. "What are you talking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, instead of answering him, Brian looked at Grace who was beside Jason. "You really don't remember? You once saved a boy while wearing a similar floral dress. You could have left him behind, but you insisted on carrying him on your back and finding him a way to live! You wanted him to trust you, to believe that you could carry him down that hill."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Brian in confusion. She did have a floral dress when she was a child, but she had no memory of what he was saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough!" yelled Jason as he yanked Grace behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Things were getting out of his control, and he was caught off guard by the speed. The man Grace loved right now was not Brian, but...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, are you afraid? Are you afraid she's really the one I'm looking for?" said Brian as he stepped closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together and stared at him with cold eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew Brian was right. He was indeed afraid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid Grace would find out she was the one Brian had been looking for... He was afraid she would find out the truth he had been keeping from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt her hand hurting as Jason was holding her with much force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He held her hand so tightly that it... began to tremble. It was as if he was silently telling her of his panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She never thought that his hand would tremble like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, Grace raised her other hand and grabbed Jason's trembling hand.</p></div>
