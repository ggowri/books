        <h1>Chapter 2249</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fear surged in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the man in front of her had seen through all her intentions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, I... I was just..." Jacqueline Bowman stammered to explain, but Martin Weiss ignored her and rushed out of the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary looked at Jacqueline Bowman with disdain. She had seen many women like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her boss did not care about any of them. The only one her boss cared about was Mrs. Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla arrived outside the company&rsquo;s building and intended to hail a taxi back. She only found her behavior of taking a taxi here today a little ridiculous after coming across that scene in Martin Weiss's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had called, she would not have seen that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was still a tightness in her chest. It was like it was trying to prove something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... it was something she did not want to prove!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A taxi stopped in front of her. She was about to get in when a hand suddenly grabbed the door. "Kyla, wait. Let me explain. It's not what you think."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "I'm not thinking about anything. I just wanted to tell you about the parent-child event. Nelson's classmates know that we're married now. If you don't attend the parent-child event, I'm afraid that people will gossip about our child again. I hope you&rsquo;ll attend if you're free."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes darkened. She made it seem as though his explanations were unnecessary and all she cared about was the parent-child event.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really not care about what I do with other women?" he asked in a murmur.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's heart trembled a little, and the nagging feeling in her chest was screaming something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What should I care?" she asked back, deliberately ignoring the feeling in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, are we going or not? Don't waste my time holding the door open like this!" the driver at the front said impatiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hurriedly said, "I'm sorry. We're almost done!" Then, she looked at Martin Weiss. "I&rsquo;ve already said what I needed to say. Let&rsquo;s not waste the driver's time. You don't have to explain whatever you do with other women to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she got into the car and pulled the door shut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The taxi drove away quickly, but Martin Weiss was still standing there. His body felt as if he had been dunked in ice water. It was so cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that one word from her could make him feel like he was in an ice cellar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that she did not care about him at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haha... Ha..." He laughed bitterly. In the hospital that morning, he even thought that she still cared a little about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all just wishful thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss returned to the office looking soulless.</p></div>
