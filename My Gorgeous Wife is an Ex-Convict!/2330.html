        <h1>Chapter 2328</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla subconsciously stepped back until she reached the wall. There was no more room behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hands were pressed against the walls on either side of her body. It almost seemed as if she was imprisoned in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He leaned down gently, his breath spraying on her face while his cold voice rang in her ears. "Do you regret it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shuddered, her long eyelashes covering her eyes. She had experienced too many things. Moments later, she looked up at him. "I just made the best choice for you and me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The best choice?" He looked at her mockingly. "Who are you to say you and me? Did you ask me? You arrogantly decided without even asking me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." She paused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his fingers to her lips. "You know what? If you had said that you regretted it, maybe I would&rsquo;ve said yes to your request and let Jacqueline Bowman off. Unfortunately, you missed the chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She met his eyes. "You wouldn't say yes to my request even if I did say I regretted it." It was because he was no longer the man who loved her. He would never agree so easily just because she said she regretted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After so many years, she understood how ruthless a man like him could be to someone he did not love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she had hurt him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who are you going to ask for help from if I refuse? Chase Harper?" There was a hint of jealousy in his voice that he did not notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at Martin Weiss in surprise. "Why did you mention Chase?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He asked in reply, "What's the matter? Can't I mention him? Does he mean a lot to you? Kyla, how dare you? One moment, you're begging me, and the next moment, you came back with Chase Harper."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Chase has nothing to do with us. I just ran into him on the street," she said in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ran into him?" He was unconvinced. "What a coincidence to run into each other in L City like that. Tell me, what are the odds of two Emerald City residents running into each other in another city?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had a headache. He probably would not believe her no matter how she explained it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s really a coincidence, Martin Weiss. I'm sorry for rejecting you, okay? Don't take your anger out on Chase," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her explanation irritated him. The mention of &lsquo;Chase&rsquo; made him frown. "Do you want to protect Chase Harper so much? Are you afraid I'll lay a hand on him and take my anger out on him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just don't want innocent people to get hurt!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Innocent?" He chuckled. "So you don't love Chase Harper and have no feelings for him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath. "Even if there are any feelings, it's just friendship. I&rsquo;ve never loved Chase!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then who do you love?" He demanded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her lips together tightly and looked away from his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could she tell him that he was the one she loved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was her first love and the person she wanted to be with all her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that they had experienced so much later on that she thought she had stopped loving him and gotten over him. However, it turned out that... the love remained deep in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed to be deepening bit by bit too.</p></div>
