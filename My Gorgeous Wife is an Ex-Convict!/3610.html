        <h1>Chapter 3608</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, the girls' faces were filled with embarrassment, and one girl's face turned bright red as she stepped forward, "Jasper, we were only concerned about you, why do you have to speak in such a harsh manner!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I think I don't need this kind of concern," Jasper replied, "Besides, when you care about someone, do you always like to unjustly accuse them? Do you think things should be a certain way without even understanding the whole situation? Don't you find that ridiculous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the post made it very clear, and besides, if William didn't have a guilty conscience, why would he hack the forum?" the other person argued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper sneered, "Do you have any evidence to prove that he hacked the forum? If you don't have any evidence, then what you're doing is defamation. I remember that defamation can land you in jail, so tell me, do you want to go to court with the Barlow family's lawyers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girls' faces changed at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One of them quickly said, "We...we were just talking casually, we didn't mean anything else, let's just say we were meddling in other people's business." After speaking, she quickly pulled the others back to their seats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this incident, the classmates in the class looked at Jasper with slightly different eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper, however, didn't pay attention to those strange glances. For her, the only thing she cared about was the person she wanted to care for. As for everything else, it simply didn't matter!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During lunchtime, Jasper once again had lunch with William in the school cafeteria, as usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There would always be occasional strange glances from the people around them, and even quite a few people whispering. Without much thought, Jasper knew what those people might be talking about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about the uncomfortable things my classmates said this morning, Jasper suddenly spoke up, "William, how about we go out to eat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William looked up and his gaze fell on her face. "Do you want to go out to eat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I've had enough of the food in the school cafeteria. I want to try something different," she made up an excuse, not wanting him to become the subject of gossip or hear more hurtful words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She let out a sigh of relief, and the two of them stood up and walked towards the school gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the school, Jasper found a KFC. "It's been a while. Let's have this for lunch today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed lost in thought and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them entered the store and found a seat. "What would you like to eat? I'll go order," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just get me a non-spicy hamburger combo," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William turned around, ordered two combos, and after a while, he returned to their seats with the food, placing Jasper's combo in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper picked up the burger and started eating it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The taste of this place hasn't changed much over the years," Jasper said. "When I was a kid, I used to love their food. My mom would bring me here to eat every week."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But didn't you gradually stop liking it?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, it's still nice to have it occasionally!" she replied. "By the way, why aren't you eating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He brought the food over, but she was the only one eating!</span></p></div>
