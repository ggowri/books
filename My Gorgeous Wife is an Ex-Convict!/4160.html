        <h1>Chapter 4158 Her Purpose</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The gifts Tina brought were all exquisite items, such as fine bone china tea sets, rare embroidered fabrics, as well as delicate trinkets and rare supplements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Thoughtful." Colin Hunter said with a cheerful smile, looking much more amiable compared to the stern face of the elder Mr. Hunter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina had only met Colin and Adele Hunter twice before, counting this time, it was only the third time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Unlike Colin's cheerful smile, Adele remained expressionless and silent, not paying much attention to the gifts. After exchanging a few pleasantries, she excused herself and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Colin smiled and said, "She's not feeling well, so she went to rest. Don't mind her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Of course not." Tina replied with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You dare to come this time, quite brave of you. Aren't you afraid of being thrown out again later?" the old Mr. Hunter said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Then Chandler will have to go back with me earlier." Tina shrugged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The old Mr. Hunter frowned, "In principle, since you haven't married into the Hunter family yet, you shouldn't be allowed in the ancestral home. However, since Chandler wants you to adapt to the ancestral home before marriage, I agreed. But you and Chandler's marriage, you must not change your mind, understand? If you were to change your mind, then it won't just be you, even the Stephenson family..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I know!" Tina immediately interrupted the old Mr. Hunter, "I definitely won't change my mind. If you don't believe me, I can actually marry Chandler right away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Of course, provided they can help her steal the family household register!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Colin and the old Mr. Hunter exchanged a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler frowned and said to his father and grandfather, "You don't need to take Tina's words seriously."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He knew very well that his father and grandfather wanted his marriage to happen as soon as possible, but he still hoped that she would make this decision when she was more mature, and not regret it in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina pouted, she was telling the truth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If the Hunter family could get her household register today, she could register her marriage with Chandler tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, since Chandler said this now, Tina didn't continue the topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'll take Tina to her room first," Chandler said, leading Tina away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Colin turned to his father and said, "Dad, can this child really save Chandler?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "At least she can really ease Chandler's pain," said the old Mr. Hunter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was confirmed by him personally during Tina's last visit to the Hunter family. "It's just a pity that she's still a bit young."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Colin naturally understood the meaning behind his father's words. If Tina were a bit older, then Chandler wouldn't have to wait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The two of them had an age difference of 8 years, and Colin had been waiting for Tina to grow up all these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But Tina has good feelings for Chandler, it's just a matter of waiting for another year or two," Colin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "In these one or two years, who can guarantee that nothing unexpected will happen? Don't forget, wasn't this Tina involved in a scandal with a famous idol before?" the old Mr. Hunter said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When the scandal broke out online, although the Hunter family spoke to the Stephenson family, they were all worried that their engagement might change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Fortunately, Chandler clarified that it was just a misunderstanding, a fabrication by the media, so that matter was resolved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And at this moment, Chandler took Tina to a room, not the guest room she stayed in last time, but a room next to Chandler's room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> There was a hidden door between the two rooms, also known as the so-called couple's room.</p></div>
