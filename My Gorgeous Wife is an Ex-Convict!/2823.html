        <h1>Chapter 2821</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had the urge to have her way with him, kiss him, and...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop!' Valda Theller quickly reminded herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." Brian tugged at the bathrobe again before leaning over and looking at Valda Theller. "Would you like to see the lower part?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The lower part?' Valda Theller turned redder and quickly turned around, saying, "No... No thanks. You can check yourself. You... You can apply the ointment yourself if you've hurt yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stammered, trying to stop herself from overthinking. If she went on, she might force herself upon him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Brian found no injury except a scratch on his arm after checking himself, which was a relief to Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two spent the next few hours in a hotel room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked through his phone, checking for messages. Meanwhile, Valda Theller had nothing to do. Looking at the hotel brochure by the bedside, she found several pieces of white paper and a pen. She picked them up and began sketching Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not the first time she had sketched Brian. She usually drew Brian quickly and smoothly, but she kept pausing today. When she got below his neck, she could not help picturing the way he looked after he took off his bathrobe just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sleek collarbones, sturdy chest, and captivating abs... The image was deeply imprinted on her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she came back to her senses, the piece of paper in her hand showed a sketch of Brian after taking off his bathrobe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared at the paper in her hand, embarrassed. 'I... I can't believe I drew this! Brian mustn't find out, or he&rsquo;ll think I'm a pervert!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hurriedly crumpled up the sketch in her hand and pinched it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Is it a bad drawing?" Brian's voice rang out as his dark phoenix eyes looked toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She met his eyes and replied guiltily, "Yeah, it's... not that good." It was actually too good that she outperformed herself. Anyone who knew him would recognize it was him in the sketch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me have a look," said Brian, slightly curious about what it would be like if she did not draw so well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't. It's not a good sketch." She got up quickly and stuffed the crumpled piece of paper into the bag she had brought with her today. Then, she licked her dry lips. "I... I'm getting a glass of water."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she got up and walked over to the water dispenser.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian went to the water dispenser first. He poured a glass of water and gave it to Valda Theller. "I want to drink water too. You can go first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller raised her hand to take the glass. However, Valda Theller's fingers subconsciously winced when their fingers touched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The glass fell to the floor, breaking into pieces. The water spilled all over as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, I missed it." Valda Theller wanted to crouch down and clean up the mess, but Brian pulled her up when she was halfway down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't pick the shards up. They&rsquo;ll cut your hand. I'll ask the hotel staff to clean it up later," said Brian.</p></div>
