        <h1>Chapter 1195</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know full well whether I'm lying or not." Grace ignored Stella's antics. Her gaze only fell on Brian's face. "Do you believe what I say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The shock in Brian's eyes slowly faded. His long eyelashes fluttered a little and then they were slowly lowered. "Do you want me to believe that you're the little girl who saved my life when I was a child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Grace. She knew it was too sudden for her to say it now, but... she wanted to gamble on his trust. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you remember when we met on the edge of the cliff on the 49th day of your grandmother's death? What did you say when I asked you if you were the little girl?" Brian's voice rang faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt bitter. She had just wanted to give Jason a sense of security. Therefore, even though she had recovered her memory, she still insisted on denying the fact that she had saved him when she was a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "I remember. I denied it back then, but&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But afterward, I still asked you more than once if you are that girl!" Brian's voice was tinged with sarcastic laughter. His phoenix eyes slowly looked up, also full of sarcasm. "But you kept telling me over and over you're not, and now you want me to believe that you are. Grace, don't you think it's a little ridiculous?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly trembled. His words and eyes were like a loud slap in her face that made it sting with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mouth was full of bitterness. She deserved all this! She kept denying it back then, and now she wanted him to acknowledge her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know you may find what I'm saying right now ridiculous, but Bryn..." She called him by the nickname he told her back then. "I really am the little girl you met when you were a child. I can explain why I denied it over and over again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said with self-mockery, "Explain? Grace, I love you, but I don't want you to tell me such a lie for another man. If you're really the girl I've been looking for, why did you deny it every time I asked you? How disdainful are you not to want to have anything to do with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A lie?" Grace stared blankly at the man who would have given his life to save her. He would walk up to her with blood all over his face and asked if she was hurt, but he would not believe her. "Do you really think it's a lie?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The look in her eyes made Brian feel an indescribable pain in his heart. She was the one he wanted to protect, but he felt jealous again when he thought of her defending and trusting Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He tried to ignore the pain in his heart. "What do you think? If it's true, you had too many chances to tell me the truth. But why did you choose to tell me after Chase Harper's incident? Do you want to help Chase Harper that much? You'd even make up such a lie for him?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella, who was beside him, immediately said with a look of grievance, "Grace, you've gone too far! You can't say that even if you want to help Chase Harper win the lawsuit. Have you ever thought about what Brian will think of me if you say this? Brian will just think I'm a liar! Have you thought of what will happen to me?"</p></div>
