        <h1>Chapter 4119</h1>
        <div>.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he stepped out of the nanny car today and looked up to see her, something seemed to slowly spiral out of control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bringing her onto the nanny car and keeping her there was just to prevent her from being photographed today at the film studio, to avoid further rumors from spreading, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kit, are you ready? We're about to start shooting," the assistant director said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit gathered his thoughts. He shouldn't be thinking about anything else right now. All he had to do was focus on the shoot. This was his first step into a new field. He could only succeed, not fail!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Tina was still in the nanny car, watching everything inside. The assistant got out of the car with Kit, leaving only her inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wasn't Kit afraid that she would mess with things inside the nanny car? Tina thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was this... the trust of an idol towards their fan?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The glass on both sides of the nanny car was covered with a special film. You could see outside from inside, but you couldn't see inside from outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Tina could see the outside scene through the glass, but unfortunately, she couldn't see the filming scene outside!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Eugenia called, "Tina, where are you? You've been in the bathroom for too long."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was sweating profusely. So much had happened that she almost forgot Eugenia was still waiting for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Something happened earlier, and now I'm in Kit's nanny car," Tina didn't hide anything from her good friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia was someone she could trust!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Eugenia was extremely surprised. "How did you end up in Kit's nanny car?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina explained the whole situation to Eugenia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "So, he's worried that someone might take a picture of you coming here, and it would make things even more complicated between you two," muttered Eugenia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "That's probably it," Tina said. "But in the nanny car, we couldn't see anything that was being filmed. I really wish I could see it!" Tina felt a great sense of regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was such a rare opportunity to be so close to the filming location, but she couldn't see anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Wait a minute!" Eugenia said, ending the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Before Tina could react, Eugenia called back on video and aimed her phone at the filming location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because it was a long distance, there were many things that couldn't be seen clearly, but at least it was better than just sitting bored in the nanny car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina chatted with Eugenia while watching the "live broadcast" on her phone until the door of the nanny car opened and Kit walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What are you doing?" Kit asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Uh, just having a video call with a friend," Tina said, but she deliberately adjusted the phone camera so it wasn't facing Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia, on the other hand, heard Kit's voice and immediately exclaimed, "It's Kit! I saw him get on the nanny car just now! Can I talk to Kit?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because Tina was using the speakerphone, Kit naturally heard all of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina looked at Kit awkwardly. "My friend wants to talk to you. Is that okay? You've met her before, it's Eugenia. You even took a photo with her and gave her an autograph. She's your loyal fan, and she's here with me today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was afraid that Kit would refuse Eugenia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Eugenia is an even bigger fan of Kit than she is!</p></div>
