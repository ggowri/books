        <h1>Chapter 3703</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why rush? You said you were going to the bathroom, right? It's on the other side. Let me take you there!" Crispin said, grabbing Veronica's hand and pulling her in the opposite direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's steps became unsteady, and her head began to feel heavy. The three drinks she had earlier may not have seemed like much, but they were hitting her hard. Her tolerance for alcohol was average, and she could feel the effects of the drinks rushing </span><span>to her head. She was afraid that she would soon lose consciousness, and that would be dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Mr. Ward in front of her was definitely not a gentleman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I can go by myself. You don't have to take me," Veronica said weakly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why bother? Let me take you!" Crispin said with a lecherous grin. He then pulled Veronica into his arms and whispered, "Your whole family is counting on my deal. If you accompany me tonight, I can sign the contract with your father tomorrow. It's a good deal, isn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crispin dragged Veronica towards the direction of the elevator.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica struggled to push him away, but it was useless. To outsiders, they looked like a couple being intimate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a door from a nearby private room opened, and a few figures walked out. One of them saw the two embracing and paused for a moment, feeling that it was inappropriate. He then spoke up, "Mason, come this way," and led Mason down the other staircase.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason responded with a faint sound, about to turn around, but his footsteps suddenly stopped when he caught sight of that familiar face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The face that was always free of makeup was now adorned with delicate and elegant makeup. Her cheeks were slightly red, her eyes misty as she looked at the short and chubby man holding her. Her lips were slightly parted, as if whispering sweet nothings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wearing a white dress that outlined her beautiful figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was completely different from the woman he saw a few days ago.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people accompanying her seemed to notice that he was looking at the man and woman, so one of them said to Mason, "That man is Crispin, the young master of Toyar Group."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Mason said coldly. Was she unwilling to be just an assistant again, dressing up like this and being intimate with this man?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she find a sugar daddy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of anger that had not yet come over him spread, but then he silently scolded himself for being emotionally affected by such a woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it was she who had pushed him away with her own hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he decided to bury all the past, the relationship between him and her had already been completely severed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason turned around and walked towards the other end of the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica, in her drunken haze, saw those familiar eyes. Whose eyes were they? They made her feel at ease, as if she didn't have to worry about anything as long as those eyes were there.</span></p></div>
