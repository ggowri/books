        <h1>Chapter 1667</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The maid brought out the dinner that Grace had asked to keep aside. Jason took the cutleries and began to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He ate calmly. Even if it was only a simple act of eating, he did it with grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had planned to wait for Jason to finish his meal before talking about today's events, but Jason spoke first, "A flowerpot almost hit you today. Fortunately, you're alright. I'll get more people to protect you after this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace froze a little. Then, she realized that her bodyguard or her driver must have informed him about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay." She did not refuse his proposal. "I was indeed lucky that it missed me. I've gotten the bodyguard to look into the flowerpot incident, but there&rsquo;s no news yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The cleaner threw it," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The cleaner?" Grace froze. "You had someone look into it too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He said, "It's a matter that involves you. Of course, I'd have someone look into it! Fortunately, you're alright." If something had happened to her, then he might lose his mind and destroy the whole building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He put down the cutleries and abruptly grabbed her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her fingers were slightly deformed, and he knew it was because she had gotten injured in prison. Lily was the one who hurt her, while Sean looked on coldly the whole time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason recalled the cleaner's bloody hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No matter how terrible someone else's hands looked, it would not arouse the slightest pity from him. Only her hands could make his heart ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Why are you looking at my hands like that?" Grace said a little uneasily as her fingers twitched. "My hands... don&rsquo;t look very good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She tried to pull her hands away as she spoke. After all, women always wanted to show their good side to the one they loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her hands were ugly compared to the average person&rsquo;s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, his fingers clasped her hand in his. "Your hands are beautiful. They&rsquo;re the most beautiful to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could not help blushing. 'Is... this sweet talk? Does he have any idea how alluring it is when he says that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, I know you're trying to make me feel better. I've already gotten used to the way my hands look after so many years," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I mean it. I like everything about you. I find you simply beautiful, including your hands. No other hands can replace them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He took her hands and pulled them to his lips as he spoke. He pressed his thin lips on her deformed finger bones, planting kisses after kisses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace blushed even more. They were in the dining room. Though it was a little far from the living room, the space was not enclosed. The children and the maids in the living room could see them if they looked in their direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Someone will see us," Grace warned in a whisper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then let them watch." Jason chuckled and gently licked her fingertips with the tip of his tongue. "Grace, we're husband and wife. It's natural for us to be more intimate, isn't it?"</p></div>
