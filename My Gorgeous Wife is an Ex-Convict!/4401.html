        <h1>Chapter 4399: Standing Up for Him</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the agent heard Harley utter the words "secret door," his eyes flickered for </span><span>a moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager had a bitter look on his face. It seemed that all those messy rumors really couldn't be trusted. They all said that the eldest princess of the Hart family had already abandoned Calvert, the popular newcomer.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why quite a few people have set their sights on Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But look at the situation now, it doesn't seem like Princess Hart has abandoned Calvert at all!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this isn't handled properly, even the restaurant might not be able to save itself!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they had known that Princess Hart was going to show up, the restaurant would have never agreed to host Miss. Maldonado, no matter what.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What secret door are you talking about..." The agent on the side hastily said, desperately giving the manager meaningful glances.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley snapped, "I didn't ask you!" Then, turning to the manager, he said, "If anything happens to Calvert today, I won't let anyone involved off the hook!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, both the manager and the agent's faces changed!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The manager quickly pointed to a button on the wall, "This... this is the secret door's switch!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley rushed forward and immediately hit the switch.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hidden door slowly swung open, and from within came the stifled sounds of groaning!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This voice... it's Calvert's voice!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley jolted, abruptly rushing into the room. The scene inside ignited a fury within her, as if all her blood had surged to her forehead.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Calvert's hands were tied up, and more than half of his clothes had been torn off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the bed, all sorts of messy tools were scattered about, and Calvert was continuously moaning and pleading.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let... let me go... don't... stop..." He gasped, struggling to get the words out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This doesn't look like someone who's drunk. It's more like they've been drugged!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miss. Maldonado had her back to Harley, unaware that it was him who had barged in. She thought it was her agent, so without turning around, she said, "I don't know how you train your artists, they don't even know the basic rules. If I hadn't drugged him in advance, I might have been beaten up by him. Come on, help me out here. I'm determined to 'have my way' with him today!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Miss. Maldonado was spewing out a string of obscenities.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley took a deep breath and suddenly shouted, "Come out now and deal with this despicable woman for me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before anyone else could react, two figures dashed into the dark room!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone jumped in surprise. Only then did Miss. Maldonado react, turning to look at the people behind her. When her gaze landed on Harley, her pupils suddenly contracted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is... the eldest princess of the Hart family!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why, why are you here?" Miss. Maldonado asked, somewhat flustered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley didn't respond to her. Instead, one of the two bodyguards who entered the room picked up Miss. Maldonado, who was only wearing her underwear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Put me down, put me down..." Miss. Maldonado pleaded in distress. Harley looked at Calvert on the bed, still suffering from the effects of the drugs, and his anger surged even more.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hit me!" she demanded outright.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time she had so decisively ordered the bodyguard her father had assigned to protect her, to attack someone who wasn't even a threat to her safety!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the room was filled with the wailing of Miss. Maldonado.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The agent and manager looked as pale as death, with the agent trembling all over, constantly breaking out in cold sweat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What on earth is going on? Didn't Miss Hart already dump Calvert?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why is he now standing up for Calvert?!</span></p></div>
