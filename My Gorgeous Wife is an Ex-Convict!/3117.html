        <h1>Chapter 3115</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Don't rush... don't rush! He said to himself in his heart. Now that she's back, he still has plenty of time to let her put aside her hesitation and become the Valda who wanted to work hard to be with him before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't have to answer me right away. Whenever you're ready to give me an answer, you can tell me then," he said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at him, tilted her head back, and kissed his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she couldn't say the word "okay" at this moment, she wanted to kiss him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was both uncontrollable affection and remorse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sadness in his eyes once again pierced her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If possible, she really wishes that he could be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... short-term happiness, she may be able to provide it now, but what about long-term happiness? Can she provide that too?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After three days of staying in the hospital, Valda was finally able to be discharged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because Valda was discharged on a workday, she told Camille that she didn't need to come pick her up. Instead, Brian was the one who picked her up from the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian drove towards Valda's apartment while she sat in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the way, Valda couldn't help but look at Brian. Since kissing him in the hospital room yesterday, although their interaction was still similar to before, she felt like something was different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And as for her, what are her plans for the future with Brian? Valda only feels more confused than ever before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do I really look that good? You're staring at me so intensely," Brian's voice suddenly echoed in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda suddenly snapped out of it and realized that she had been staring at the other person the whole time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, the traffic light ahead turned red, and his car came to a stop. His handsome face turned towards her, directly facing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm just... taking a casual look." She blushed slightly and gave an excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? Feel free to take a look." He seemed to imply something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm just taking a quick look... The light is green, you can go now," she hurriedly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled and started the car again. "Alright then, you can keep looking around as much as you want. I'm happy to be looked at so casually by you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was taken aback and for a moment, she didn't know how to respond. But...is he happy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she sees the curve at the corner of his lips, she also feels happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When you deeply love someone, you will also feel their joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long after, the car arrived at the entrance of Valda's residential area. Suddenly, Valda exclaimed in surprise because she saw Simon at the entrance of her residential area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next to Simon, there was a woman with an elegant and beautiful appearance. She held Simon's hand with one hand, while the other hand hung by her side wearing gloves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first glance, Valda felt strange. After all, the weather was relatively warm and there was no need to wear gloves. However, she suddenly thought of someone and her eyes widened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And at that moment, Brian's words confirmed her suspicion, "How did Simon and Amber end up here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is she really Amber?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I knew that Amber was living and working in Emerald City before, but I didn't expect to see her here." Brian stopped the car and got out with Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And at that moment, Simon and Amber also saw Valda and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda hadn't even had a chance to say hello when Simon suddenly ran towards her and jumped into her arms, hugging her tightly.</p></div>
