        <h1>Chapter 837</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did Martin Weiss come when you were hospitalized?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook her head. "No, I think he must have left Emerald City. I hope he'll stop having such ridiculous ideas after this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pausing for a moment, Kyla's face then showed a dejected expression. "I'm not afraid of his revenge. I'm afraid of getting involved with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had brought her too many injuries and too much pain! Even the sight of his face was painful to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed to be telling her how ridiculous her love for him was back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you going to do?" asked Grace. After all, no one knew what Martin Weiss would do next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe I'll leave Emerald City and move to another place where he can't find me," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they continued to stay in Emerald City, Martin Weiss might discover Nelson if he ever came looking for her on a whim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was the last straw!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked, but she understood Kyla's decision. "If you leave Emerald City, I'm afraid we won't see each other as much in the future, not to mention Nelson. I'll miss all of you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We can have regular video calls. Besides, with the ease of transportation now, we can meet up whenever we want to!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Kyla seemed to say emotionally, "I don't want to live in hiding, but... Maybe after Martin Weiss marries Paisley Daniels and they have children in some other way, he won't have time to deal with me anymore. Then&hellip; I wouldn't have to hide anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, are you sure you don't want me to help you reverse your case?" Grace brought the topic up again. "Martin Weiss may not have meant to hurt you. Maybe he was misled by Paisley Daniels that you pushed her down the stairs and caused her to have an abortion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled bitterly and shook her head. "Whether he meant it or not, it doesn't matter to me now. Even if I get the case reversed, I'll never get those three and a half years back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, when she repeatedly told him that she was framed, Martin Weiss still chose to testify in court and send her to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does it matter... if he did it intentionally or not?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, it doesn't&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss chose to appear in court, thinking that she was a criminal, it had already decided their fate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sighed to herself and did not say anything more. She just told Kyla to take a good rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, the greatest grief was being completely disappointed. She thought that Kyla was severely disappointed in Martin Weiss, so much so that she did not even want to reverse the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace chatted with Kyla for a long time and then asked for Mrs. Corbyn and Nelson's address. She planned to visit Nelson later. After all, she had not seen Nelson for many days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace left the hospital with a heavy heart. Kyla was in this situation because of Martin Weiss, and she had to go back into hiding for Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'By comparison, I'm so much luckier!' Grace smiled wryly and looked at her flat stomach.</p></div>
