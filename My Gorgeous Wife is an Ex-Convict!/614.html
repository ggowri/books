        <h1>Chapter 613</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's brows furrowed as she listened on. Things she never thought of were now suspicious after listening to Hadwin&rsquo;s analysis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The director's wife is a smart person. What's the point of doing these things at the expense of others when it wouldn't necessarily benefit herself?" Hadwin said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was not a fool. When he said this, she seemed to understand it at once. "Is there someone behind the scenes who wants to give Evelyn a hard time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is It Evelyn's rival in the entertainment industry? Brian, or&hellip;' Jason's face flashed across Lina's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's about it," Hadwin said carelessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who do you think is behind this?" asked Lina, looking like she was willing to take advice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I had to guess, it would be Jason," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because there are very few people who can control this. The director's wife probably can't instruct this person. Besides, Evelyn is also Brian's ex-girlfriend. With Evelyn making such a fool of herself, of course Brian's reputation will be tarnished. How many people in Emerald City dare to offend Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was silent. What Hadwin just said made her think that it really was Jason who did it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Jason probably doesn't want to be too secretive about this matter either. He has a lot of tricks up his sleeve to make Evelyn disappear in this world without a sound," said Hadwin. In his opinion, what Jason did was more like a warning to those who had some wits not to have any funny ideas against Grace. Evelyn was a prime example.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it really okay for Grace... To be with Jason?" asked Lina suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was stunned for a moment. Then, he noticed that her face was a little pale and her hand that was holding the spoon was trembling slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened?" He took her trembling hand in his. "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His warmth passed from his palm to hers, making her hand slowly stop trembling. "It's just... I find Jason kind of scary all of a sudden."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could work out such a scandal that Evelyn had no chance of turning things around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was getting justice for Grace, which was a good thing, but was that not what was so terrible about this man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all too easy for people like Jason to destroy someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was in love with Grace now, but what if... With Jason's mind, tricks, and abilities, Grace would not be able to resist at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Scary? Yes, Jason is indeed a scary man. Why? Are you worried about Grace?" said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then just pray that Grace won't betray Jason for the rest of her life," said Hadwin. "After all, he must really love Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was an absolute possession. An outsider like him could feel it just from the way Jason looked at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like a beast keeping their prey in their own sphere of influence without allowing others to go near it.</p></div>
