        <h1>Chapter 2843</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Girlfriend...' He seemed to have gotten used to her presence and closeness without knowing it...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to be more relaxed when she was around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She always felt that he had helped her with many things, but she had no idea that she was the one helping him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was awakened by a phone call from Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, did Brian spend 100 million dollars on your portrait yesterday?" Camille Strickland asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was confused. "H-How do you know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's online, but someone seems to have suppressed it, so it didn't go viral. My colleagues at the magazine told me about it," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller finally sobered up slightly. 'Thank God... it didn't go viral.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But that's too much! He spent 100 million dollars on your portrait. Aren't you going to be rich in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Hart family was going to donate money to charity anyway. He only bought my portrait to donate to charity. Besides, don't you know how much my portraits are worth?" Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anyway, I can see that Brian is really good to you. I think he's serious about you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's eyelashes quivered. "He has always been very serious about me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, Valda Theller sighed and sat up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, Brian has been serious and honest with me since the beginning. He&rsquo;s never lied to me whether in our first fake relationship or in our current real relationship.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller threw back the covers and got out of bed, but she paused after taking two steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not wearing the gown she wore last night but her pajamas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her clothes had been changed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she remembered was falling asleep in Brian's car. Then... She... She had no recollection of what had happened!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did have a few glasses of champagne at the gala yesterday. 'Did I... get drunk, so he changed my clothes?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She instantly blushed at the thought and immediately saw the gown lying on the other side of the bed. The jewelry was on the nightstand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Brian did change her clothes for her, what should she say the next time she saw him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a quick wash, Valda Theller came to the studio with her head in a mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her two assistants had also learned about the portrait that was auctioned off for 100 million dollars. They asked her if it was true when they saw her. They looked envious after getting her confirmation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller answered half-heartedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the afternoon, Valda Theller visited Camille Strickland at the magazine office to discuss the comic fiesta.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My boss said to hold a book signing for you at the company booth at the comic fiesta," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller frowned slightly. "Is it because of Brian?" As a comic artist, she looked forward to a book signing. After all, it meant that more people were reading her comics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she would rather not hold one if it was only because of Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you thinking? The company planned it long ago. I didn't tell you because it wasn't confirmed. I was scared you&rsquo;d get excited over nothing. Isn't the adaptation of your comic being filmed now? Besides, you've been in the business for years. You have a certain amount of work published, so you're fit for a book signing. But I gotta tell you it's nothing big. The company's just going to promote you and sell your comics at our booth at the comic fiesta," said Camille Strickland.</p></div>
