        <h1>Chapter 1687</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A smile appeared on the corners of her lips. She posed for the camera. When the livestream started, Irene Lynch gave the opening lines as she mentally counted down the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as the crowd that had gathered to watch the two kids play the piano began to disperse, a voice suddenly rang out. "Unethical lawyer, give me justice!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">An ordinary-dressed man took out a banner and held it high. The words on the banner were: [Unethical lawyer Grace ruined my family!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, your mentor's a well-known lawyer in the legal world. You colluded with your mentor and ruined my family. Your husband's Jason from Reed group, and he&rsquo;s protecting you. You guys are rich and powerful, but I don't believe I can't clear my name in this just society." Damian Harmon headed toward Grace and Jason as he shouted, hoping to attract the attention of everyone around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As expected, many people around them stopped and looked their way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips tightly together and frowned as he made Grace and their two children stand behind him. The bodyguards secretly protecting them also stepped forward and gathered around them, waiting for Jason's command.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Damian Harmon did not do anything aggressive like last time. Instead, he plopped down in front of Grace and Jason ten steps away from them as he held the banner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm just a nobody. I have no power. Yes, you can throw me out and keep me quiet! Why is it so hard for ordinary folk to seek redress..." Damian Harmon said while sniffling and in tears. One minute, he was accusing Grace, Jason, and Old Lawyer Watts. The next minute, he was saying how things were for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Only then did the onlookers around them realize Jason, the man famous in Emerald City, and his wife were also here at the exhibition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Damian Harmon had been active online all this time, so some people here knew him. They were instantly interested to see how this would unfold. Some even took out their phones to secretly film them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The staff member filming Irene Lynch's livestream spoke upon discovering something. "Gosh, it's Jason! Oh my God, this is juicy news."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, the staff member turned the camera to Jason, Grace, and Damian Harmon, while another staff member apologized to Irene Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch said with an awkward look on her face. "Don't film it. This is bad. Won't this impact the Reed family negatively..." However, she was secretly overjoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Damian Harmon had come as planned. Once Damian Harmon said something shocking in public, rumors would no longer be rumors if everyone talked about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The man would feel as though there was a needle stabbing into his heart if his woman lost her reputation and was deemed guilty. Even if Jason did not care now, he would care in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason wanted to step forward, but Grace pulled him back and said, "Let me do it. This is my problem, after all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not want to just stand behind him and do nothing but be protected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace went up to Damian Harmon. "You said I framed you, and the procuratorate is already investigating it. You want to know the truth? They'll announce the result of the investigation once they&rsquo;re done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who knows if you've bribed the procuratorate?" asked Damian Harmon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You&rsquo;re speaking rashly when the result isn't even out yet. In other words, you're going to assume that the procuratorate was bribed if you lose in the end?" said Grace.</p></div>
