        <h1>Chapter 4255 Discovery</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was completely stunned, she never expected to hear such words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A child? Umbilical cord blood? Life-saving?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't force her..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandfather, I will make Tina fall in love with me," Chandler interrupted the old Mr. Hunter. He knew that if he didn't make a stand now, his grandfather would inevitably hurt Tina, so he had to promise first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure she will fall in love with you? She has lost her memories, even if you want her to fall in love with you, how much time will it take?" the old Mr. Hunter worriedly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, time was what his grandson couldn't afford the most right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of pain only intensified year after year.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did his grandson have to continue to stay by Tina's side for another ten years or more, just so that Tina could fall in love with him again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It won't take too long," Chandler said, "She already has feelings for me, I guarantee that after a while, she will fall in love with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Mr. Hunter sighed, "I hope what you said is true. Don't forget, you are the only bloodline of the Hunter family! I don't want my bloodline to end with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Mr. Hunter said, glancing at the portrait of the woman hanging on the wall. Who could have imagined that the Hunter family would be plagued by such a curse for thousands of years?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even with all the wealth and power, they were ultimately trapped in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand," Chandler said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Mr. Hunter looked at his grandson's appearance and knew that saying more would be useless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I couldn't sleep and pulled you out to chat. Now you should go back and rest," the old Mr. Hunter said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to stay here a little longer," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, the old Mr. Hunter patted his grandson's shoulder, "It's fine for you to stay here for a while, think carefully about whether it's worth it to do all this. Don't make yourself </span><span>miserable."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler lowered his </span><span>gaze,</span><span> he was doing all this because he loved Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to force her to do anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Tina didn't willingly want to have their child, then he would rather do as Tina wished and not have a second child!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if it meant that his life might not last much longer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never thought he would love someone like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now that he did, he realized what a profound feeling it was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For that person, he could sacrifice anything. As long as that person was safe and happy, it was worth more than anything else!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Mr. Hunter left the room, leaving Chandler alone standing in front of the table, gazing up at the portrait.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was young, he used to resent the woman in the portrait. If it weren't for her curse, he wouldn't have to endure such pain!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as the years passed, his resentment gradually faded and turned into another emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for this curse, he wouldn't have met Tina, and he wouldn't have been there for Tina as she grew up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a faint sound came from the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler: "Who's there?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides him, there was someone else in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But there was no response, the air was suffused with a sense of suffocation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Come out!" Chandler said sternly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Under the table, there was a faint sound of sobbing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's body suddenly stiffened, then his face turned pale, and his gaze fell under the table, filled with unease and fear...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like a taut string as if it could snap at any moment.</span></p></div>
