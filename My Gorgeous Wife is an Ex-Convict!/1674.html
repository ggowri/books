        <h1>Chapter 1672</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Reed... It... It was just nonsense... I... I didn&rsquo;t mean it..." the reporter quickly stammered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The others around them dared not raise their phones or cameras anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This was Young master Reed of Emerald City! No one dared to film him. If they did, they could forget about staying in Emerald City starting tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His cold voice rang out. "You&rsquo;re not going to repeat it? Listen here, then. Jasper Reed's my daughter and I know very well what kind of person my wife is. You reporters can cover news, but if you want to slander my wife and my daughter, you're making yourselves enemies of the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was not only talking to the reporter he was stepping on but also the people around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The reporter was being stepped on so hard that his chest ached. He could only repeatedly agree with Jason, while those around them did not dare to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Who would be so stupid as to make themselves enemies of the Reed family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was only when Jason and Grace left that they breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The reporter who was stepped on awkwardly got up and walked toward the parking lot with his tail between his legs. He talked to himself as he walked, "Pfft. What the hell? She's probably just guilty. Just wait for me to write this story!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before he got into his car, two people grabbed him on both sides.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He immediately recognized that the two men holding him were the bodyguards beside Jason earlier. He instantly felt a chill running down his spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He thought the whole thing was over after Jason stepped on him. He thought it was the only price he had to pay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It seemed that he was too naive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, he realized that the man he had just offended was Jason. He was the last person one should provoke in Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the car, Grace said, "I thought you were trying to stop me when you caught my hand. But you kicked the reporter afterward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't want you to hurt yourself for such a person. In the future, let me take care of those troubles for you," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That reporter is clearly a petty person. This incident may be widely reported after this and land you in trouble,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Trouble?" Jason chuckled. "Then I'd like to see who dares to give me trouble. No reporter would dare to cover what just happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was dumbfounded. Well, given his status in Emerald City, it seemed possible. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"By the way, Damian Harmon probably has someone behind him. They told him to sue you and your mentor, or rather... he hit it off with them and decided to work together,&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace frowned. "Any idea who it is?" After all, with her profession, she had offended tons of people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We're still working on it. It shouldn't take long to find out," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Whoever it is, I won't let them off the hook easily!" said Grace. They had crossed her limits by making an issue out of her and her mentor.</p></div>
