        <h1>Chapter 4108</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's lips trembled, "Do you...blame me for deceiving you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina said, "I don't think it's deception. You were planning to tell me the truth in the future, and not to use other lies to cover up this truth, so...um, it can only be considered that you didn't tell me earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The warm current surging in her chest accumulated more and more, as if it was about to overflow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Moreover, I am happy that if we have children, we can save you. You won't have to endure that kind of pain all the time in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina said, a smile unconsciously appeared on her lips, she was really happy about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler suddenly hugged Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina..." His hoarse voice, with a hint of choking, escaped from his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> How could he not love such a woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He had been by her side since she was a baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even though his initial purpose was just to survive in the future, her cheerfulness, her brightness, and her frankness gradually attracted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> To the point where he was addicted and unable to extricate himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If his life was supposed to be dark and painful, then her existence was like a beam of sunlight, shining into his world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm here," she said, raising her hands to hug him back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina...Tina..." he murmured her name over and over again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It turned out that she was really his redemption. Not just because she could keep him alive, but because she made him "want" to live, to spend a longer future with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> That night, Chandler held Tina tightly, even when they went to sleep, they were still embracing each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Of course, for Tina, the regret was probably...they only hugged all night and didn't do anything else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In the following days, Tina felt that since she knew how to relieve Chandler's pain, she should put childbirth on the agenda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Pfft!" Eugenia sprayed her milk tea out of her mouth in the campus cafeteria.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina looked disgusted, "Come on, do you have to be so exaggerated?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia wiped the milk tea stains with a tissue and said, "That's because you're being too exaggerated. You're planning to have a baby with Chandler? How old are you? You're not even married yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "We can take our time with the marriage, having a baby is more important." Tina waved her hand nonchalantly. "Besides, I'm already 20 years old, my body is capable of having a baby!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "..." For a moment, Eugenia felt speechless, as if this friend of hers always made her unable to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "How can we increase the chances of getting pregnant? I read online about the ovulation period and timing." Tina muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Come on, I haven't even had a baby yet, why are you asking me this?" Eugenia rolled her eyes. She had no idea about these things!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Right." Tina nodded in agreement, realizing that she had asked the wrong person. She stood up and said, "Well, I'm leaving now. See you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, where are you going?" Eugenia asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, I'm going to find someone who has given birth to ask," Tina replied.</p></div>
