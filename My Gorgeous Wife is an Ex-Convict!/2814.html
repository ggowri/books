        <h1>Chapter 2812</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she pretending to be asleep to avoid embarrassment? Or does she not want to see me anymore?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her scent seemed to linger around his nose, making his heart feel heavy as if something was blocking it. His body seemed to stiffen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was right beside him, but he became confused. He had no idea what to do with this woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Do I... still love her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What will I do if I can't fall for her or I&rsquo;m able to resist her attraction? Are we doomed to divorce and separate? Or am I going to make a different choice?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the darkness, Martin Weiss slowly turned over and fixed his gaze on Kyla's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could only see the outline of her face in the dim light, but... it made his eyes burn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out even a faint outline could haunt his mind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On Wednesday, Valda Theller prepared the items she needed to pay respects to her parents. She carried a big bag downstairs where Brian's car was already there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw her come out, he opened the car door, took the bag, and put it in the backseat before opening the passenger seat door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two got into the car, and Brian drove toward the cemetery where the tombs were located.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for coming with me today," murmured Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'd like to meet your parents too," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "They&rsquo;ll be happy to meet you. Even if we can't be together in the future, my parents will be happy that I even dated such a great boyfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned slightly. For some reason, he found the words indescribably harsh. "We can't be together in the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think we can't be together in the future?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was silent. Although she wanted to take a chance and make Brian fall in love with her, she knew deep down that the possibility of success was too small.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian still kept his first love in his heart. Besides, could she get him to move on and fall for her when his feelings for his first love were still so deep?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if a woman could do that, it would not be her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she was liking him more and more now, so she could not help but want to keep the dream alive a little longer. At least they were a real couple now. They were in a real relationship and not acting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Listening to her silence, Brian pressed his thin lips and said, "Valda Theller, is this all there is to your love for me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" She blinked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the traffic light turned red and the car stopped in front of a zebra crossing, Brian turned to look at Valda Theller and said, "The more you love someone, the more you want to be with them all your life. But you don't seem determined to be with me all your life, so you don't love me that much, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, that's not true. I... I like you very much. I love you very much!" she said quickly. She suddenly blushed when the words left her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh, what did I say?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You like me and love me very much, but you don't believe you&rsquo;ll be with me in the future?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit heavily on her lip, not knowing how to reply for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The red light changed to green, and the car continued driving.</p></div>
