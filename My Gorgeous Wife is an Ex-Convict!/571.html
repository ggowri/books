        <h1>Chapter 570</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She fell back in three steps, and in a blink of an eye, she was lying flat on the ground. Then, a cry of pain escaped Evelyn's mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was just being kind, Sis. Why did you push me away like this..." Evelyn looked like she was in pain. Her eyes watered, making her look piteous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sudden turn of events drew the attention of fans at the entrance, many of whom began pulling out their phones to take pictures and record.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked coldly at Evelyn. "You know perfectly well whether I've pushed you or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you say that, Sis? I know... You've only been out of jail for a while, so you probably feel wrongfully treated. I... I won't mind it or anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn continued to play the role of a bitter little sister in front of the crowd while making it clear in front of everyone that Grace had been to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For those nosy fans, it was hot gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina panicked. "You're so mean, Evelyn!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn only said with an aggrieved look, "You can scold me whatever you want. You're Sis's friend. I only hope you can persuade Sis not to go on banging her head against a brick wall. I won't blame her this time for pushing me, but it won't be all right if she pushes someone else next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn gave every appearance of a good sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina nearly fainted with rage. She had seen shameless people before but never someone as shameless as her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's manager hurried to help her up and asked with a worried look on her face, "Are you all right? Does it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn bit her lip and frowned as she said, "I think I've sprained my ankle... It hurts so much..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager immediately snapped at Grace. "You're her older sister. How can you do this to your little sister? Is it because she's a star and Master Hart's girlfriend, so you're jealous? How can you be so jealous..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager was just saying this when her voice suddenly stopped and her eyes went over Grace. She was looking at somewhere behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned around and looked over at the entrance. She could see Brian standing there, and Hadwin was beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What combination is this?' Grace was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like Grace, Lina froze when she turned around and saw the two. Then, she felt a little guilty and dared not look at Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she told him she had to work overtime today and that was why she did not have time to meet him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin raised his eyebrows when he saw Lina. He had a half-smile on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A little liar indeed! She lied to him about working overtime and ended up here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to Hadwin's expression right now, Brian's face was horribly gloomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inexplicably, Evelyn's manager thought Brian was looking at her with a deathly icy stare.</p></div>
