        <h1>Chapter 3417</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel couldn't help but furrow his brow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, a teacher heard about the fight and rushed over. Upon seeing some people lying on the ground, the teacher immediately approached and asked, "What's going on? Are you guys okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel gave a bitter smile, "There might be something important."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who did it?" the teacher asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's Mason!" a classmate exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The teacher was taken aback, and his face immediately turned pale. His gaze towards Daniel and his group was filled with worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, that is the second son of the Reed family! Getting into a conflict and even fighting with someone, if the Reed family were to retaliate against these students because of this...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's easy to imagine the consequences that these students, and even their families, will face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After seeing the teacher's expression, Daniel suddenly remembered something. Oh right, the boy who fought with them is named Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The surname Reed...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had heard before that the second son of the Reed family was studying in their school as a sophomore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family refers to the first wealthy and influential family in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, when he heard this gossip, he didn't think much of it. After all, even if he was a rich young master, he had no connection with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, he never intended to curry favor with anyone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He just didn't expect that the other person turned out to be Veronica's "little brother", and they even had a fight today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he thought of the Reed family, Daniel's heart sank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was dragged by Jasper to a secluded spot in the school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where are you taking me?" Veronica asked, feeling the pain in her wrist from his grip. "Mason, stop and let's talk!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His footsteps finally stopped, and he turned to look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She breathed a sigh of relief and said, "Can you please let go of my hand? You're hurting me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hesitated for a moment, then lowered his head and loosened his grip on her hand. He saw the red marks on her wrist, which he had caused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry," he murmured, carefully lifting his hand and gently touching the red marks on her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica said, "You should be apologizing to the people you hit earlier, not me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This statement caused his expression to suddenly change. "Do you think it was my fault?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was your fault. You can't just hit people for no reason," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I didn't like them talking about you dating that guy," he said, his voice sounding muffled and clearly unhappy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They were just joking around. It doesn't mean anything," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if they weren't joking? What if that guy really wants to date you? Would you agree?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" Veronica paused for a moment, she hadn't really thought about this question before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems that from childhood to adulthood, no boy has ever pursued her. During her time in elementary and middle school, he almost completely occupied her time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, she has thought about what kind of boyfriend she would have in the future.</p></div>
