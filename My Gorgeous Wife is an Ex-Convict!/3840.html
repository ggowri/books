        <h1>Chapter 3838</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence approached Jasper, "It's not me who wants them dead, it's Daniel!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper stared at the person in front of her in a daze. Was this really the Lawrence she used to know? The Lawrence who was pure and clean and could play pure music?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, she had regretted over and over again the way they had parted, even without listening to his explanation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And later, when he needed help the most, she didn't answer his calls in time, so he had been missing for so many years, and even when he suffered a great disaster in his own home, she couldn't help him in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She blamed herself, but she never blamed anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she understood right from wrong, she knew that the root of all this was Lawrence's parents borrowing money everywhere under the name of the Reed family, and Lawrence's mother using that money for gambling, which eventually led to increasing debts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So her parents cut ties with the Abbott family, and Jasper didn't feel like they did anything wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The only mistake was that she heard Lawrence and his parents' conversation and thought that Lawrence was only pretending to be her friend for his own benefit, not genuinely, so she ended their friendship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had listened to his explanation instead of ending their friendship right away, at least they would still be friends, and those debt collectors might not have resorted to such extreme measures, and Lawrence's parents might still be alive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Lawrence... wouldn't have lost his parents and disappeared for so many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... have changed!" Jasper murmured, finally realizing this fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who wouldn't change? Do you think I can still be the same after all these years?" Lawrence said coldly, "Do you think I would still be the naive kid who only wanted to please you with a word from you, and practice piano until my fingers almost bled?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I said you have become like Daniel, always blaming others for your mistakes, but never examining your own mistakes, because this way, you can transfer all the guilt and sense of wrongdoing onto others, and you yourselves can become 'innocent', </span><span>right?" Jasper spoke frankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence's face suddenly became very ugly, "What do you mean by always blaming others for your mistakes?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it true? Your parents' death, in the final analysis, was because of your mother's gambling and your father's indulgence towards her." Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was the first time she had spoken so bluntly in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Lawrence suddenly shouted, "The dead should be respected, how can you say such things?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's true, but because the dead should be respected, even though I have known this all along, I haven't said it like this, but the more I don't say it, the more you blame the Reed family for your parents' mistakes, so now I have to say it like this!" Jasper said, "Lawrence, if you want to blame me, to resent me, to retaliate against me, I can understand, but you shouldn't take revenge on my family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence's facial expression was gradually distorting, "Jasper of the Reed family, you speak so righteously, but if I put you in the middle of an explosion to retaliate against you, would you accept it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper said calmly, "It's not about accepting it, it's just that I wouldn't hate you that much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence sneered, seemingly mocking Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper continued, "If it's a meaningful death, I'll accept it, but if it's a meaningless death, why should I accept it? If you want revenge on me, I understand, but that doesn't mean I have to accept death as the price of my fate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she still had her family who loved her, and William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If something really happened to her, how sad would they be?</span></p></div>
