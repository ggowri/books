        <h1>Chapter 2046</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Unlike normal people, I can't hear without the hearing aid, so I'm deaf," Nelson said indifferently. His indifference pricked Kyla's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if her son had been hurt by the discrimination against the disabled that he had resigned to calling himself deaf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then I'll be deaf too, so I'll be the same as Nelson!" the little one said. Her dark eyes were still full of tears, and her face was streaked with wet tears. Even so, she spoke so seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn's heart suddenly throbbed as if something had touched his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one was only three years old and had no idea what it meant not to hear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If he took the hearing aid off, the whole world would be silent and the silence was scary!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if he was the only person left in the world!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't be like me. You'll be looked down on if you're like me," said Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm not afraid. I'll beat people up if anyone bullies Nelson!" Juliet sniffled but behaved domineeringly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two contradictory states strangely merged in her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The irony and frost in Nelson Corbyn's eyes seemed to be melted by Juliet's young voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's eyes were misty as she looked at Juliet. She suddenly felt grateful for the little girl, who was warm and friendly like Chase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, don't worry! Nelson is an outstanding child and will succeed in the future. When he does, no one will discriminate against him because of his hearing," Chase Harper consoled as he patted Kyla's shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you!" Kyla said with a sore nose. She was saying thank you to Chase Harper and Juliet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the four people did not notice that someone was filming them with a phone in the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In Weiss Residence, Martin Weiss silently looked at the photos he received in his email.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Not many people knew this email address. The sender's email address was registered abroad, and every photo they sent was of Kyla and another man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Four people were captured together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides Nelson, there was another little girl. In the photos, they looked like a happy family of four.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss only found his chest feeling stuffy as if something heavy was pressing it, making him a little breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He also knew the man in the photo. He had seen the man named Chase Harper at Kyla's side back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This man seemed so ordinary to him, but he could make Kyla smile and Nelson approach him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In some of the photos, Kyla and Chase Harper were looking into each other's eyes. Kyla's eyes were gentle and warm.</p></div>
