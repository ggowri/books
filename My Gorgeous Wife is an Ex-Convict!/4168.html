        <h1>Chapter 4166: Lina's Persuasion</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Letting out a sigh, Hadwin said, "I always worry that Tina's feelings for Chandler are only because of the agreement made between me and the Hunter family all those years ago. That agreement has bound Tina's emotions from the start, limiting her choices to Chandler. I'm afraid she doesn't actually love him, that she's not clear about her feelings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't think too much, you worry too much!" Lina playfully tapped her husband's nose. "I believe Tina has already thought things through. Besides, love and a good life aren't guaranteed just because you think about it before marriage. In the days to come, it's up to Tina to walk her own path. We can only offer help when she needs it, but we can't control her life. She should make her own choices."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin smiled wryly, "I know, you always manage to convince me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Seeing this, Lina knew that her husband had accepted the fact that their daughter was getting married soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I can persuade you because I know we both love Tina very much. It's because I love her that I can persuade you," Lina said, lowering her head and gently brushing her husband's lips. "But speaking of the past, I can't help but remember that night when I had you pinned down. You have no idea how adorable and beautiful you were back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin couldn't help but smile wryly. Only she would use words like adorable and beautiful to describe him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "And what about now?" Hadwin asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Now, even though you've aged, you're still a handsome and good-looking dad!" Lina smiled and kissed him on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> No matter how old her adorable husband became, she still loved him so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even when they both had gray hair, she would still love him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin wrapped his arms around his wife's waist, matching her passionate kisses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If it hadn't been for her initiative in the beginning, maybe there wouldn't have been their story! And he loved Lina's enthusiasm for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was as if no matter how many years had passed, he was still her favorite man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I love you!" Hadwin whispered. "If Chandler doesn't love Tina as much as I love you, he's done for!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina couldn't help but laugh and cry at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This man, still thinking about that at a time like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, I believe that Chandler will love Tina just as much," Lina said, her hand starting to crawl into Hadwin's clothes, shifting his attention. "Okay, now that they're not here, tonight I want to repeat what we did on our first night together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin was taken aback. Did she mean she wanted to pin him down like they did back then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "By the way, no matter how I treat you, you can't resist, you know, after all these years of pampering myself, I don't have the strength I used to have. If you resist, my arms, my waist, and legs won't be able to hold up." Lina added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin's scalp suddenly felt numb, feeling as if tonight, he might be the one who couldn't hold up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Meanwhile, Tina and Chandler left the Stephenson family. She looked at Chandler's furrowed brow and immediately reassured him, "Don't worry, in my house, if my mom says it's okay, then it's definitely okay, there won't be any problems."</p></div>
