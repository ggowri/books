        <h1>Chapter 1135</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella said what she had planned to say, turning herself into a victim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she was a victim, Grace's incident was not her fault. Grace was just unfortunate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is everything you're telling me now the truth?" asked Brian as he stared at the person in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella immediately said, "Of course. Why would I lie to you, Brian? You know what? The more I thought about it later, the more scared I became. If I had entered the lounge, and since I'm not as smart as Grace, then I'd... have gotten myself into a scandal in Emerald City and be laughed at by now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to throw herself into his arms and seek comfort as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian pushed Stella out of his arms. "Stella, I've told you that I only regard you as my childhood savior, so don't do anything inappropriate or say something inappropriate in case you mislead others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's expression immediately changed at that, and she bit her lower lip hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Also, I hope you're telling the truth today. The police have started investigating this, and it won't be long before they have the results," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella forced a smile. "Yes, I also hope... they'll have the results soon so that I'll know who's trying to hurt me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her heart was beating wildly and uncontrollably. It was almost as if it were about to burst out of her throat. Fear was welled up inside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What if... they find out? What do I do then?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella could not help shuddering at the thought of what might happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over the weekend, Lina asked Grace out to relieve her boredom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina drove Grace to a famous temple in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are we here?" Grace was a little curious. After all, Lina was not the kind of person who liked to pray to Buddha or worship deities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard that the Buddha here is efficacious, so I brought you here to get rid of your bad luck. By the way, you can also make some wishes to the Buddha here if you have any. Maybe they'll come true!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace broke into a smile. "If you&rsquo;re accompanying me here today, don't you need to accompany Hadwin Stephenson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He has gone back to the Stephenson family&rsquo;s house to deal with some things! He won't be in Emerald City recently," said Lina before blushing suddenly. She seemed like she was about to say something but stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Grace, if I say I'm going to marry Hadwin Stephenson in three months and want you to be my maid of honor, will... Will you do it?" Lina was in a dilemma when she said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it would be the event of her life in three months, and she wanted her best friend to be her maid of honor. It was also a deal they had made when they were students. Whoever got married first, the other one would be the maid of honor.</p></div>
