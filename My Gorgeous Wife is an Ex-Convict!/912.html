        <h1>Chapter 911</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The senior executive tried his best to finish the last sentence of his presentation before looking at Jason carefully, fearing that his presentation was not up to standard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The atmosphere in the conference room had become tense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a phone rang suddenly. Everyone in the conference room looked at the two phones lying in front of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Senior executives of Reed Group knew that Master Reed had two phones. One was a high-end limited edition phone that cost more than 100,000 dollars while the other was a cheap phone you could find everywhere in the city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed was usually protective of the cheap phone even though it seemed to never ring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, it was the cheap phone ringing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All they saw was a sudden change in Master Reed's expression as he picked up the phone and answered it in front of everyone. Moments later, they heard Master Reed saying, "Are you begging me... Fine, send me their photos and their last known location. I'll have someone look into it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone was immediately surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Beg? Has Master Reed ever cared if someone begged him or not? Master Reed has a heart of stone. He won't even care even if someone hurt their head kneeling in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now, he&rsquo;s taking the initiative to ask them if they were begging him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who the hell is on the other line?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Terrence knew that the call was from Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because only Grace knew the phone number of that phone and only Grace's number was stored on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However&hellip;' Terrence also wondered what Grace had begged Master Reed for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the call was over, Grace was still staring at the phone in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I begged Jason&hellip; just now! Yes, I had to!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be worth it if all she had to do was beg to find out Kyla and Nelson's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Kyla was the only one who was willing to give her a job despite her criminal record when she was struggling to find one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I heard that it was Curtis Row who sent so many yellow roses to you last time. Is it true?" Andrea Schwartz approached Grace with feigned kindness and said, "I heard that Curtis Row's a playboy, so don't be fooled."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace glanced at her. She did not believe that Andrea Schwartz was concerned about her. Andrea Schwartz probably wanted to find out whether she and Curtis Row were together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's none of your business," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz frowned embarrassedly, grunted, and returned to her seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went on with her work, but her mind was on Kyla and Nelson. It was almost time for her to leave work when she finally got a call, only it was Terrence who called.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla and her son Nelson Corbyn were indeed taken away by Martin Weiss, Miss Cummins. They&rsquo;re now in the hotel suite where Martin Weiss is staying."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you bring them out?" Grace asked hastily. If Martin Weiss was forcing Kyla to stay in his suite, she might not be able to get out at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps... Martin Weiss was forcing Nelson to stay. If that was the case, then Kyla would also be forced to stay in the suite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Plenty of speculations ran through Grace's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm afraid not. Master Reed only gave orders to find out where they are. If you want them out of there, I'm afraid you'll have to talk to Master Reed," Terrence replied respectfully.</p></div>
