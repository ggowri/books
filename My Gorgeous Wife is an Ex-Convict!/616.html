        <h1>Chapter 615</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now it looked more like the room she had before she went to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If there was anything that belonged to her mother... She had previously put her mother's things away in a box under her bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to the bedside and tried to drag the box out from under the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me do it." Jason crouched down and helped Grace drag the box from under the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dust kicked up in the room and soiled his clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry," she said. She knew he always liked things clean, except when he had lived in the rented house with her. He hardly ever let himself be caught in any dust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's there to be sorry about? Isn't it a man's job to help his woman?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'His woman&hellip;' These words immediately made Grace's face turn red. Then, her attention fell on the box in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It contained the clothes and accessories she had left behind, the painting her mother painted with her, and the little toys she bought for her. They were all packed into the box when she was older.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, she was too young when her mother died. Most of her mementos were thrown away. When she got older, there was not much left of her mother's stuff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace opened the box and looked at the familiar things inside. Her eyes could not help turn red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were still here. These things... Were still here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she got out of prison, she tried to take these things out, but her father refused to let her. She only managed to retrieve the photo album of her and her mother when it was almost burnt to ashes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought her father had probably thrown them away. Perhaps she would never get them back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect them to reappear in front of her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tears gushed from her eyes and trickled down her cheeks drop by drop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason frowned slightly and raised his hand to wipe away her tears. "I didn't do this to make you cry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whenever he saw her tears, he felt his heart breaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just happy. I'm happy to see these things again," said Grace. There were tears in her eyes, but the corners of her mouth were raised. Just like she said, she was happy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He put his finger under her chin and leaned over to kiss the tears on her face. "Then just smile. Don't cry. I want you to smile more, Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." She sniffed, trying to hold back the tears. She put her arms around his neck. "Thank you, Jay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you already thank me before?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This time, it's different than before. If it hadn't been for you, maybe I'd never see my mother's things again. You helped me get these back," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just want you to be happy." He said he would do anything for her as long as she was happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm happy," Grace said, taking the initiative to kiss him on the lips. She tried to convey her joy, her gratitude, and her love for him through the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He accepted the kiss passively, letting her get entangled with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He willingly let her take the driver's seat in this kiss while he cooperated with everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the only person in the world who could do that to him!</p></div>
