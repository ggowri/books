        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you deserve to be loved, I don't want to easily give up!" Valda said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the past hardships and challenges have now turned into sweetness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this lifetime, her marriage is very happy, and now, she only hopes that her daughter can also have a happy marriage.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian gently kissed Valda.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after so many years of marriage, his feelings for her have become even stronger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Valda, I love you!" he whispered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't know how many times he had said these words, but for him, it was still the most genuine expression from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted her to understand how much he loved her!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he wanted her to know how happy he was now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I love you too, very much," she responded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when they both have white hair in the future, she will still love him just as much!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valda leaned against Brian's embrace, thinking this way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina arrived at the Hunter Group building and informed the staff that she wanted to see Chandler.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The staff naturally recognized Tina and immediately made a phone call through the internal line.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a short while, the staff personally escorted Tina into the elevator and thoughtfully pressed the floor button.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Tina hadn't insisted that the staff didn't need to accompany her, they probably would have entered the elevator together.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alone in the elevator, Tina looked at the constantly changing floor numbers, and her mood became anxious.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was about to meet Chandler in a moment, and she had something to say to him...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elevator arrived at the floor, and Tina stepped out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary was already waiting at the elevator door and immediately said, "Miss Stephenson, please follow me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the company, some executives and those close to the CEO already knew that he had divorced his wife, so now they naturally referred to Tina as Miss Stephenson.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina followed the secretary to the door of the CEO's office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary pushed open the door, and Tina walked in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler was in his office, and as soon as he saw Tina enter, he stood up and asked, "Would you like something to drink?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, thank you," Tina replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler then asked the secretary to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary closed the door, and there were only Tina and Chandler in the office.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have a reason for coming here? I remember I mentioned before that since we're divorced, I hope we can avoid seeing each other as much as possible," Chandler approached Tina and said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came today to talk to you about something," Tina took a deep breath and said, feeling more anxious at this moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have something to tell me?" Chandler raised an eyebrow slightly, "Is there something we haven't clarified between us?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to have another child with you," Tina said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as this statement came out, even though Chandler had always been very composed, he showed a shocked expression, "What?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, I want to have another child with you!" Tina repeated.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's expression became unpleasant, "Why?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The curse of the Hunter family brings you too much pain, and it's also dangerous to invoke the witch. I've thought about it for a long time, and it seems like having another child is the least risky and relatively safest choice," Tina said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been thinking about this for days, and now that she was in front of him, it meant that she had made up her mind!</span></p></div>
