        <h1>Chapter 3543</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man who had reached out looked embarrassed. "Why reject us like that? If you have any problems, tell us, your brothers, about it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brother? Jasper suddenly sneered, they are not qualified to be her brother!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially since she is in a bad mood right now, she doesn't want to pay attention to these people at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper took a few more sips of the drink, then paid and left, completely ignoring those men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The men felt embarrassed and one of them was even angry, "Who do you think you are? We invited you to drink with us because we respected you. Don't be ungrateful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While he was scolding, he grabbed Jasper's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let go!" Jasper frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just let go, come have a drink with us. We'll call it even for today," the other person said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've already told you, I don't want to drink with you. You better let go now, or else..." Jasper replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Or else what?" the other person taunted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next moment, Jasper suddenly moved his body and twisted the hand that was holding him. The situation was reversed, and the man's arm was twisted behind his back, causing him to scream in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper used a top-level self-defense technique, which was developed by experts in this field specifically for her over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the kidnapping incident, she finally realized that relying solely on others for help was too passive. So she took the initiative to learn some self-defense skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason also had the same idea, and since his daughter was interested in it, they found a top expert to design self-defense techniques for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These techniques were not many, but Jasper has been practicing them repeatedly over the years. Even though the process was tedious, she always remembers the feeling of helplessness when she was kidnapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She also wants to become strong, strong enough to protect those she cares about in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The few men were surprised to see Jasper take action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, soon after, the other men began throwing punches at Jasper. Although she was able to subdue one of them, there were too many of them. In no time, she started dodging left and right. The bar staff noticed the conflict and rushed over to try to stop it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before the staff could reach them, another figure rushed over even faster. In just a few moves, all of those men were knocked down to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The men lay on the ground groaning, while William looked at Jasper with concern. "Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper shook her head. "I...I'm fine. But how did you know I was here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You forgot, we've shared our locations on our phones." William reminded her. On their first day of college, they had bound their locations to each other's phones so they could easily find each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, right!" she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William noticed a hint of redness on Jasper's cheeks. "Have you been drinking?" he asked.</p></div>
