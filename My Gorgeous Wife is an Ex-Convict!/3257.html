        <h1>Chapter 3255</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Amber left, the remaining few gathered together. Lina looked at the number of people and suggested, "Why don't we play cards?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Regarding this, everyone didn't have any objections, "So, two tables then?" It's just right for eight people, with four people per table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's so boring." Lina giggled and said, "Let's just have one table."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"One table?" Grace pondered, while Hadwin immediately sensed trouble upon seeing his wife's smile. As expected, her next words shattered his beliefs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let us women be in charge of playing cards, and as for the men, they can be the bet. The losing side will be responsible for taking off a piece of clothing, um... just the top half will do." Lina added the second half of the sentence sheepishly, under the gaze of her husband.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few men glanced at each other, while among the women, Lina naturally grabbed her best friend Grace and said, "Grace, you don't mind, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace smiled and glanced at her husband's ambiguous expression before stating, "I have no objections."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's kind of funny to think about this kind of bet, and she's starting to become a little interested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's something Kyla and Valda will surely agree with, right? Just think, if it's just about money and drinking as the stakes, it wouldn't be exciting at all. We need that drive to win." Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about the bet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This bet is different. Everyone will definitely try their best to keep their own husband's clothes," Lina said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, you've convinced me with your twisted reasoning," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda glanced at Brian's clothes today, compared them to the clothes of the other men, and blushed as she said to Brian, "Brian, they all agreed, and I feel bad not agreeing too. Besides, you're not dressed too lightly today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, Valda also agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Four men looked at each other, at a loss for words. Since their wives had all agreed, they had no choice but to comply obediently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the four men, Hadwin is the most helpless and pitiful one who is accompanying someone he shouldn't be with. It's because his own wife came up with this bad idea, so he can only apologize to the other guys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason is the most relaxed of the group, with a slight smile on his lips that makes Hadwin seriously doubt that even if the bet was to take off his pants, Jason wouldn't care. As long as Grace agrees, he will agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin looked serious and glanced down at his clothes. He began to care about who Kyla would team up with for a while, after all, this was a game of "Double-Dutch" and having a good teammate was important!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Regarding Brian, he furrowed his brow and leaned in to Valda, asking, "How good are you at playing cards?" He hadn't really seen her play much when they were together.</p></div>
