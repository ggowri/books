        <h1>Chapter 3500</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica freshened up, changed her clothes, and walked downstairs only to find Mason sitting alone at the dining table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where are the others?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They have already had breakfast," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry, I overslept," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Reed family has different breakfast times," Mason said. "What would you like to eat, Veronica?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's good to have someone like you," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason then had the servant bring a breakfast that was the same as his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica sat down quietly and ate, while Mason sat beside her, silently watching her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she had her head down, she could feel his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It made her heart race strongly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't help but tighten her grip on the cutlery in her hand, suddenly looked up and said to Mason, "Mason, can you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" he asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their eyes met like this, and her heart seemed to be even more flustered, beating more violently!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"N-nothing!" She bit her lip and lowered her head to continue eating breakfast in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What's wrong with her? She clearly wanted to tell him not to keep looking at her like that, but as soon as she met his gaze, she became flustered again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I didn't use to be like this before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing breakfast with great difficulty, Mason suddenly said, "By the way, Veronica..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" She looked up and unexpectedly saw his body leaning towards her, his pretty face getting bigger and bigger in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her body instinctively leaned back, trying to create distance between them, but because she leaned back too much, her center of gravity suddenly became unstable and she was about to fall backwards!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" She exclaimed in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next moment, a strong arm had already wrapped around her waist, stabilizing her body and preventing her from falling to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, don't move," Mason's voice sounded low in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," she replied softly, his breath brushing against her cheek and making her face flush. "You, you can move your hand now, you don't have to keep holding me like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, his hand finally moved away from her waist. She breathed a sigh of relief, but then he took out a necklace from his pocket. "I cleaned this necklace, Veronica, do you still want it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is..." Veronica looked at the necklace in Mason's hand. It was the same one that had injured the kidnapper and was also a gift he had given her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I thought I lost it! I didn't expect it to end up back in your hands!" Veronica's face lit up with joy. "If it weren't for this necklace, I might not have been lucky enough to escape from that warehouse. I might have..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice trailed off, and the feeling of humiliation and helplessness that came with being overpowered began to spread through her body again, causing her to tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Mason suddenly embraced Veronica. "Don't be afraid, Veronica. You don't have to be afraid of anything anymore. No one can hurt you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice soothed her, and her trembling gradually subsided, giving her a sense of peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, she didn't push away his embrace, but leaned against his shoulder. "Mason, it's really nice to have you here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she was lonely and anxious as a child, his appearance made her life different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Between her and him, it wasn't that she accompanied him, but that they accompanied each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was him who helped her walk out of the shadows of her mother's death, her father's remarriage, and her stepmother's mistreatment. It was him who made her feel that she was not alone in a family, and that he was by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter what happened, he was by her side.</p></div>
