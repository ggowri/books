        <h1>Chapter 174</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, compared to the nauseating sensation, she was more afraid of losing her luxurious lifestyle. She was afraid of needing to live like a regular person&mdash;working a fixed job from nine to five and becoming prudent when buying any luxury bags.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maria Martin feared to lead that sort of life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For Maria Martin, she thought of herself as someone who should rightfully lead the upper class life while looking down at Grace and others of her kind. Now that Grace had witnessed her currying up to a fatty, the anger in her heart heightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Maria Martin, do you know her?&rdquo; the short and chubby man next to Maria Martin asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yeah. She just came out of jail not too long ago and now works as a road sweeper!&rdquo; Maria Martin viciously revealed Grace&rsquo;s identity before looking at the manager. &ldquo;Since when does Royal Court allow even a road sweeper to dine here?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason&rsquo;s back was facing Maria Martin, so she did not see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, the manager could!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, he was trembling in fear and wished that he could chase Maria Martin out of the restaurant right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;So what if she just came out of jail or if she is a road sweeper. As long as Young Master Reed wants to bring her in for a meal, even a beggar can eat here.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It is not up to you to decide who can come in to dine at our restaurant. I hope that you will apologize to this lady here!&rdquo; the manager said to Maria Martin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maria Martin wanted to explode in a rage that instant. She was supposed to apologize to Grace? What a joke!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to keep your job?&rdquo; She spat angrily before leaning pitifully at the middle-aged man next to her. &ldquo;Mr. Grant, this man wants me to apologize to a road sweeper. How absurd!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Grant was about to say something for Maria Martin when he heard a crisp and cold voice. &ldquo;What is the big deal with an apology? Even if you need to kneel, you should do it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Grant was flabbergasted. When he looked up to see who it was, his expression changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;This is... Jason! President of Reed Group!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Grant had seen Jason once during a dinner gathering. However, because of the difference in status, he had no way of getting near Jason for a chat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Grant had wanted to get near Jason to get acquainted with him, but he was short of the opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would never have imagined that he would meet Jason once again during such an occasion. Furthermore... it was obvious based on the current situation that Maria Martin had offended Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Grant was a man who loved pretty girls, and Maria Martin had been pleasing him very well throughout the times they spent together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a beautiful proud princess like her to clamber all over him, it was something that boosted his ego very much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if compared to the potential chance of offending Jason, Mr. Grant would not mind slapping Maria Martin instead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was looking for trouble when there was none. Of all people she had to scold, she scolded the person next to Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Mr... Young Master Reed, it&rsquo;s just a misunderstanding! A misunderstanding!&rdquo; Mr. Grant quickly explained as beads of sweat formed on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Misunderstanding?&rdquo; Jason&rsquo;s cold gaze swept across Mr. Grant. &ldquo;If misunderstandings are easily formed in this world, then there are going to be plenty of misunderstandings circulating.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Grant&rsquo;s expression turned bad as his fatty flesh trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maria Martin looked dumbfounded. Although she did not know who this man was, she knew that he was not a simple character if Mr. Grant was being this careful with his interaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, she noticed that Grace&rsquo;s hand was interlocked with that man&rsquo;s.</p></div>
