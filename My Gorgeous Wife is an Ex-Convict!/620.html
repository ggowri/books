        <h1>Chapter 619</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know him well?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sort of. There's nothing I don't know about his family, career, life, and personality. Besides, I've been living at Reed Residence for a while," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about his dark side?" Lina blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her friend in surprise while Lina looked slightly embarrassed. "I mean, after all, he's Jason. Don&rsquo;t they always say that he's ruthless and those who&rsquo;ve offended him won&rsquo;t come to a good end?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her eyes slightly. She knew what her best friend meant now. Just like when she was in prison. A lot of people had picked on her because of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... "Lina, if you don't take that step, you&rsquo;ll never know what the future holds for you. I want to take that step because I think no one in the world will love me more than him," said Grace as she looked up at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her best friend's firm gaze, Lina's heart quivered. The two had been best friends for years. She knew Grace's longing for family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was the way people were. The more they lacked something, the more they desired it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're right. Sometimes, you'll just have to take that step. However, no matter what happens in the future, you should always remember that I'm here for you and we're best friends forever," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Grace. However, this simple answer involved too much emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not be here today if it were not for Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In her heart, Lina was already her family! She was someone she would spend her life repaying!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A few days felt like years to Brian. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had sent someone to the town where he and the little girl met to investigate everything about Grace. He was trying to match Grace with the timeline of the girl he remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it had been too long. It would require more effort to check it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's scandal had been making all the headlines these days, but he barely paid any attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whether it be Evelyn or the other women he had been with before, they were merely substitutes for the person he sought. They were just there to consign his longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, substitutes were only substitutes. No matter how many substitutes he found, they could not fill the void in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However&hellip; Only when he held her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at his hands in a daze. Only when he held Grace did he feel as if the void was filled with something. It made him reluctant to let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never felt this way before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, it was her. It must be her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she appeared in front of him in a floral dress that day, he seemed to see the little girl from when he was little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she was not her, how could she give him that misconception over and over again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No woman had ever given him this misconception before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, he felt a pang of regret. He should not have given in to Jason again and again.</p></div>
