        <h1>Chapter 1577</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes... Yes, I understand. I'm not going to spend money that isn&rsquo;t befitting of my status." With that said, Irene Lynch fled the boutique almost in fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At night, Grace went back to the bedroom after putting the two little ones to sleep. She began to search for news regarding Hadwin Stephenson on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although her daughter's single bedroom was already furnished, Jay liked to sleep with Mick these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At night, she would lay on Mick Reed's bed and ask her brother to tell her a story when it was time to go to sleep. Grace did not know whether to laugh or cry at that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, considering that the two children were still young and Grace wanted them to bond, she let them sleep together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Poor Mick Reed. A child who did not talk much was now being forced into becoming a chatterbox by his sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His sister resented the lack of passion when he told her stories, so he would be forced to tell the same stories several times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace expected her son to grow impatient, but who knew her son would tell his sister the same story over and over again without showing a trace of impatience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe it was kinship, and Mick was a good brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The corners of Grace's mouth unconsciously curved at the thought of this. A voice suddenly rang in her ears. "What's the matter? Are you interested in Hadwin Stephenson? Why are you smiling at his picture?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace instantly came back to her senses. Jason had walked up behind her at some point, and what was on her phone screen was news about Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As she had been looking down at her phone, it would make others misunderstand that she was smiling at Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I just thought of Jasper and Mick. Besides, Hadwin Stephenson is Lina's ex-boyfriend. I'm only looking up news about him because of Lina," Grace quickly explained because she was afraid of being misunderstood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stared at her but did not say anything right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't you... know that Hadwin Stephenson is Lina's ex-boyfriend?" she asked when it suddenly occurred to her. After all, he had lost part of his memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even though I don't remember, Terrence and the others would mention some things about Hadwin Stephenson and Lina when they talked about you," said Jason. He remembered Terrence saying that Lina was injured after she left Emerald City to find Hadwin Stephenson. In the end, she was seriously injured by Hadwin Stephenson's half-brothers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If it were not for Lina, he and Grace... might not have gotten married!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace breathed a sigh of relief. At least she did not have to explain much about this matter. "Anyway, I'm not interested in Hadwin Stephenson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?" His thin lips smiled. "Then who are you interested in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His tone was indifferent and spoke with a cold voice, but he had ended his question with a slight rise. There seemed to be seduction in his glittering eyes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace glanced at Jason, her face slightly red. Did he expect her to give her an answer to that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why are you keeping quiet? Haven't you been proactive all along?" he said. His thin lips smiled faintly and she could hardly look away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Alright, there's no shame in falling for him!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She blushed and said, &ldquo;You".</p></div>
