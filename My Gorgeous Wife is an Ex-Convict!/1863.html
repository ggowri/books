        <h1>Chapter 1861</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he kept deceiving himself over and over again. He would rather believe her lies and that what she said was true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When it came to making a choice and running into such a test, the seemingly fragile lie stopped him from lying to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Go home. I want to be alone and not have anyone disturb me tonight," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, a pair of arms instantly wrapped around him from behind. She pressed her face onto his back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He instantly stiffened and heard her say, "I won't plead for Mrs. Watts, but my mentor and his wife are kind to me, Jay. You don't understand how helpless I was when I lost my memory and was struggling in a big city with a child. I had no past and could only fight to keep myself and my daughter alive. It wasn't until I met my mentor and his wife that I finally felt like I could take a break."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a pause, she hugged him a little tighter as if that would give her the courage to continue speaking. "I know you want Mrs. Watts to pay for what happened back then one way or another, so why don't we do it with the law&rsquo;s help? Why don't we let the court decide what to do with her for her negligence in causing you a serious injury and for her actions in causing your father to choose death?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not want his hands to be stained with his own mother's blood. It was not the way it should be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sometimes, hating a person too much also revealed... one&rsquo;s reluctance to let go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason slowly turned around. He looked at Grace and said, "What if I don't want to? It&rsquo;s too easy for her just to be judged by the law. Can her years in prison pay for my father's life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze. She could not help biting her lower lip. "Then what do you want to do to her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Since it's a life, then she should pay with a life, shouldn't she?" he asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her face paled, and under the moonlight, her face was even paler. There even seemed to be fear in her almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do... Do you want her dead?" she asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Shouldn't I?" he asked, feeling a sting in his chest from the frightened look in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is she... afraid of me? Is she going to stay away from me too?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It may seem right to you, but I think we have no right to decide whether another human lives or dies." She shook uncontrollably as she said this. "Jay, don't decide whether your mother lives or dies, okay? And don't get blood on your hands. That shouldn't happen to your hands."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She took his hand as she spoke. They were fair, clean, and defined. The contrast was even more striking when compared to her hands, which had slightly crooked knuckles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, I've suffered... the feeling of having someone else decide whether I live or die. It made me... really miserable. I... I almost died in that car accident that Lily arranged. If I had climbed out of the car a little later, the car would have exploded and I would have died!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her body trembled as her hands shook. He could feel all of it. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's eyes flashed with pain and remorse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The case was a source of great pain for her, and it was the same for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not answer her, and she stubbornly kept him company as they stood at the place his father died. She held his hand tightly as if afraid that he would leave again and not let her find him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason and Grace returned to the car when it got colder.</p></div>
