        <h1>Chapter 3101</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These days, Brian has been staying at Valda's apartment. Although Valda has repeatedly expressed her desire for him to return to his own villa, Brian still remains in her apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And when the old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart found out that Valda had returned, they came to visit her and brought along a large amount of supplements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Regarding Valda's limp, the elderly couple didn't say anything. Instead, they asked Brian to stay in the apartment and take care of Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian readily agreed to this, but Valda looked helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart left, Valda said, "Brian, umm... I plan to buy a new two-bedroom apartment in a while and have Lisa come over to live with me. I will rent out this apartment, so it's really not suitable for you to live with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to switch to a bigger house, I can give it to you. As for bringing Lisa to live with you, I have no objections. She saved your life and I am grateful to her," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have enough money to buy a two-bedroom apartment myself. If Lisa comes over and you still live with me, she might feel uncomfortable," Valda thought for a moment and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So it can be a period of getting to know each other, after all, in the future, I will be with you to serve her until old age," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She is my godmother, it is my duty to serve her until the end of her life, but you don't have to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I am her son-in-law, how could it be unnecessary?" Brian interrupted Valda's words. "Or are you saying that you don't plan to take responsibility for me? Are you going to abandon me in the end?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda almost choked on her own saliva, as she could never outdo Brian in this aspect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, sometimes getting drunk can really cause trouble, even if the person who got drunk is him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Valda took Camille with her to see a house that she had found through an agent online. They had picked out the house online beforehand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of his leg condition and Lisa's advanced age, as well as her preference for village life, she specifically chose a ground floor house with a large courtyard. This would also make it easier for Lisa to indulge in her gardening hobby and grow some vegetables whenever she feels like it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Theller, this house has two bedrooms facing south, with good ventilation and layout. Although it is on the first floor, there are no trees blocking the front, so the sunlight is quite good..." The agent was trying hard to introduce the advantages of the house, and Valda was listening carefully, occasionally asking some questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Camille, who was just a few steps away from Valda, was whispering to Brian, who had come along to view the house with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I mean... why haven't you sorted out Valda yet? I thought you had already moved into the apartment. Valda might not even buy a house and could just move in with her godmother and live in your mansion together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian gave Camille a glare. Whenever he was feeling down, she always seemed to pick on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to as well, but Valda doesn't want to. She insists on buying a house," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When Lisa arrives, what will you do? Just stay holed up in Valda's new house? But then, it might be even harder for you to get close to her. Valda is a shy person, and if an older person comes over, she'll probably be too busy avoiding any intimate gestures from you." Camille said.</p></div>
