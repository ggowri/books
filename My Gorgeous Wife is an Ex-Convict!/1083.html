        <h1>Chapter 1082</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only felt her heart constantly contracting. His certainty made her panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would wager on the rest of his life, but what would she wager on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was having a phone call with Lina and learned that Jason had taken Grace. No one knew where she had been taken to, and they did not know when she would come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, according to Lina, if Grace was able to make a call, it meant that at least Grace was not in serious trouble for now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said, "That's all we can do for now. I'll try to find out where Jason has taken Grace. Also, Kyla, don't worry about your lawsuit. I'll ask Hadwin to find another lawyer for you if Grace still hasn't shown up after a week."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you so much," Kyla Corbyn said gratefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing as long as you and Nelson are okay!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla Corbyn went to the kindergarten to pick up her son in the afternoon, she was still worried about Grace. She did not know whether it was a good thing to be loved by a man like Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'After breaking up, now Jason wants Grace back. What about Grace? Is she as fine as she mentioned on the phone after being taken away by Jason like that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After reaching the kindergarten's gate, Kyla Corbyn immediately came back to her senses and straightened her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every time she came to pick up her son, she would pay attention to her appearance as she did not want to embarrass her son. She did not have the money to dress up nicely when she came to pick him up, but at least... she looked clean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt a little relieved when she thought of how her son would talk about the interesting things he had done in kindergarten after coming home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that Nelson got into the right kindergarten, after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The teachers there took good care of Nelson, and the kids in Nelson's class were also kind. They did not discriminate against Nelson just because he wore a hearing aid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only hoped that her son could grow up as healthy and happy as regular people!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was about to enter the kindergarten to pick up her son, she suddenly stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Past the kindergarten's gates, she saw a figure that was not supposed to be there at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Martin Weiss! Why is he here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was even holding Nelson's hand and seemed to be talking to other parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson obediently stood beside Martin Weiss with his little chin slightly tilted up. He seemed to be watching Martin Weiss attentively. There was an expression Kyla Corbyn had never seen before on the little one's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt her body tense all at once, and even her heartbeat accelerated. It was as if her heart was about to leap out of her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just stood where she was, looking through the bars of the gates at the large and small figures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if feeling her gaze, Martin Weiss slowly turned his head and looked in Kyla Corbyn's direction. Their eyes immediately met in mid-air, and Kyla Corbyn's face turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson also saw Kyla Corbyn and cried out, "Mommy!" However, instead of running toward her as usual, he stood still beside Martin Weiss and gently shook his hand as if urging Martin Weiss to take him to his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss took Nelson by the hand and slowly walked toward Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... are you doing here?" Kyla Corbyn heard herself ask hoarsely.</p></div>
