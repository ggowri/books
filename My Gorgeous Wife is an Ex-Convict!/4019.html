        <h1>Chapter 4017</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't understand, how could you fall in love with me?" Nancy asked. "Is it because I helped Jasper and you mistook gratitude for love?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, I'm not a child. I know the difference between gratitude and love," Mick replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I don't understand even more. You used to hate me, didn't you? You even hated me so much that you didn't want to see me!" Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I did hate you," Mick murmured. "Because I had truly invested my feelings in a woman for the first time, only to be used. That's why I hated you and didn't want to see you. Every time I saw you, the feelings in my body kept reminding me of how much I missed you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick paused for a moment before continuing. "But at that time, I couldn't accept it. I couldn't accept that I still had feelings for you, so I kept denying it. But when you jumped off the cliff, I was overwhelmed by fear. My mind went blank, and my first reaction was to jump after you and save you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for the Reed family's bodyguard catching him, he might have really jumped!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy listened to Mick's confession in a daze, unable to react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the days I spent searching for you, I finally realized that I love you. That's why I risked my life to find you after you fell into the sea. That's why I dreamt of you every night and kept thinking about our past. And every night, I had to hold onto your luggage to fall asleep!" Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Nancy was stunned. Was her luggage still with Mick in Emerald City?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, I love you. You should never doubt that," Mick said with such seriousness and solemnity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, his expression was so sincere and solemn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And his lips deeply kissed the palm of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As if he was making a vow to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's love for her was something Nancy had never expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mind was in chaos, and all she could say to Mick was, "I think... I need to rest and be alone for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After meeting so many people and receiving so much information today, she felt exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Mick said. "Rest well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, he stood up, tucked in Nancy's blanket, and left the hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he stepped out of the room, Jasper hurried over. "Big brother, how's Nancy doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's a bit tired and wants to rest," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about the baby in her belly..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's mine," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His unquestionable tone told his family not to doubt who the father of the child was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If this child wasn't his brother's, there would probably be another storm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hearing his son's words, Jason did not show a relaxed expression, but instead said, "Let's first listen to what the doctor has to say."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Is there another problem?" Jasper felt the seriousness in his father's tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hearing the doctor's analysis, Jasper understood why his father had spoken with such a serious tone.</p></div>
