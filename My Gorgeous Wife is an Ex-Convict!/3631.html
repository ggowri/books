        <h1>Chapter 3629</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William looked at the person in front of her, lost in thought. She understood him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood his feelings towards blood ties and family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like when he returned to the Barlow family, he didn't feel any sense of family there. The only reason he went back was so that he could deserve her in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the little moments of the Barlow family, the care of his father, the love of his grandparents, he felt the warmth of family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gradually became a part of the Barlow family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of this was built through years of daily interactions, not just relying on the word "blood ties" alone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, no matter what decision you make, I will stand by your side!" Jasper said to William. "This time, I will face it together with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes welled up with warmth, and he tightly embraced her, "Alright, I will handle this situation! Trust me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe in you!" She had always believed in him since childhood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the evening, William and Jasper went to the Reed family's place. Meanwhile, Mick had been working with some computer experts to trace the whereabouts of the person who had initially posted on the school forum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they had found the original poster, he was located overseas and William had never met him before. Furthermore, he had no connection whatsoever with the Barlow family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We have located the individual overseas, but upon questioning, it turns out that he was just hired to do the job. The full text of the post was directly printed and inserted under his door, and the payment was made through an anonymous transfer, making it difficult to trace the source of the money," Jason called William into the study and informed him of this outcome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William pondered. It seemed that the person hiding in the shadows was being very cautious, and they were even aware that they would be investigated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, we did find something different regarding your grandparents," Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's expression froze, "What is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your grandparents were originally in Deer Capital. The reason they appeared in Emerald City is because someone told them that you were studying at Stanford University and also mentioned that you were facing difficulties there due to your mother's past," Jason explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was taken aback, "Who is that person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You also know that person," Jason said, handing several photos to William. These photos were actually screenshots from surveillance footage showing a man wearing a bucket hat and a mask conversing with the elderly couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are only a few screenshots, so it's hard to make out the person's appearance. We can only see their general body shape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your grandparents don't actually know the other person because he deliberately concealed his face. So, they didn't get a clear look at him. However, when your grandfather was about to fall, he reached out and grabbed onto the person, leaving his fingerprint on your grandfather's belt," Jason explained, taking out another photo and handing it to William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When William looked at the photo, it turned out to be a picture of Roger, but it was taken secretly, and Roger's gaze was not directed at the camera.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That fingerprint matches his. He is a student at your school, and it seems like both you and </span><span>Jasper know him. There were even some misunderstandings between Jasper and him in the past," Jason said.</span></p></div>
