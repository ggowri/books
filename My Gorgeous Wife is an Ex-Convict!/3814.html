        <h1>Chapter 3812</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, if Mason doesn't charge in, even if he doesn't die, he will probably feel guilty for the rest of his life, if someone like Mason really has a conscience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In any case, no matter what choice Mason makes, it won't be easy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time passed by minute by minute, and Mason stood outside the safety line, looking at the old school building in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, this place will be demolished, but the person who invited him hasn't shown up yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His anxiety was becoming stronger and stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Appear, appear in front of him, and tell him that she is safe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, his phone rang. After answering the phone for a moment, his face changed, and he spoke a few words to the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Daniel saw a group of police officers rushing to the construction site in an orderly manner, surrounding the people there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then they began to investigate one by one!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's heart tightened. What's going on? Is it related to the phone call with Mason just now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, he can't stay here any longer. If he continues to stay here, something might really happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Daniel only planned to deal with the police vaguely for a while, and then quietly leave here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, he has figured out the environment here these days and knows how to leave to avoid nearby surveillance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A police officer stood in front of him and asked for his name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Norton," he said, using the name of the person he replaced. The name recorded in the registration book was also that person's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for his appearance, although he didn't look like the person, there was no photo in the registration book, and the police would not find anything unusual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to his surprise, the police officer shouted his name, "Daniel!" the next moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was suddenly startled, with obvious panic on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure enough, you are Daniel! Tell me, why did you impersonate Norton?!" The police officer scolded him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What impersonation? He...he was sick, and I came to work for him for a day. Does the police still care about this?" Daniel found an excuse and glanced at the foreman. He had given money to the foreman before, so he could replace Norton to work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The foreman also quickly spoke up for Daniel, "Yes, that's right. He came to replace Norton today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Mason's voice suddenly sounded, making Daniel's hair stand on end. "You're just here to replace someone at work today? What a coincidence?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's...it's quite a coincidence to see you here, Mason," Daniel said with a fake smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where's Veronica?" Mason suddenly asked in a stern voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel pretended to look confused. "Veronica? How would I know? Isn't she your girlfriend, Mason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daniel, you don't have to act in front of me. The last call on her phone was from you, and you were the last person she was supposed to meet before she disappeared!" Mason said, not as a question but as a statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel panicked inside. Mason's words meant that he had already investigated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when did he investigate?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Damn it, Mason shouldn't have known about Veronica's disappearance now. He should have waited for Veronica to show up and waited until the moment of explosion to understand everything!</span></p></div>
