        <h1>Chapter 2108</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's voice was indifferent without the slightest fluctuation. It was as if she was just reciting mechanically and these vows meant nothing to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, these vows meant everything to Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss stared at Kyla while he recited his vows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does Kyla know how grateful I am that she's willing to keep the baby?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does she know that today means the marriage of a lifetime to me? And even though we might get a divorce in the future, I can still tell myself that she used to be my wife when I&rsquo;m old and lying in my coffin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It's a great honor to have been married to her in this life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'This marriage is only nominal and a tool for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But... I should be content.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He told himself. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once they came out of tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau, Martin Weiss and Kyla each held a copy of their marriage license.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Let me take you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks, I can take the bus home myself." Kyla rejected him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said bitterly, "Are you still going to reject me even when we've become husband and wife?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You know very well that we only married for the baby," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss was silent. 'Yes, I know this better than anyone!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Without the baby, she would have hated even a moment of his company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh, yes. Let's apply for the baby's birth permission certificate when you're free. I need it for the obstetric record," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, pick the time. I'll go with you whenever you want," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said nothing more, turned around, and walked toward the bus stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss looked blankly at her figure until it disappeared from his sight. Then, he laughed at himself and returned to tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau's photo place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Here, these are the photos we took when you took your vows. Choose seven," the photographer said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The photographer thought that the couple did not want to pay extra for the photoshoot, but the man sneaked over later and asked him to take some photos when they took their vows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Give them all to me. You don't need to print them out. Just email them to me," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"All of them?" The photographer froze and said, "Even if you don't print them out, it'll cost more than 50 dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How much do you want?" Martin Weiss asked readily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The photographer gave him the price, and Martin Weiss paid right away. The photographer sent the photos to Martin Weiss's email address and could not help saying, "You and your wife don't seem to be getting along. You didn't argue, did you? You're newlyweds. You have to work harder! There's no argument married couples can't resolve in the end. Say nice things and be nice to your wife. She'll forgive you in a few days!"</p></div>
