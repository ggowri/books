        <h1>Chapter 3763</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica quickly washed her face with cold water and pressed down the redness on her face. After finishing her morning routine, she walked out of the bathroom and saw some breakfast items on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These breakfast items are..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They were made by the chef at home. I brought them over when I came out. We can eat them before we leave," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica sat down at the table and saw porridge, sandwiches, some side dishes, and heated milk in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that he could be very attentive if he wanted to be. When they were together before, she was always carefree while he was very attentive. He would tuck her in when she slept, put a warm pack in her backpack when it was cold, and bring a thermos for her when they went out...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>(End of text)</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica lowered her head and began eating the breakfast in front of her. It was still warm because it had been brought in a thermos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, he just sat there watching her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, even though they hadn't said anything to each other, it felt like it was enough.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing breakfast, Veronica and Mason left together and got into Mason's car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today there was no driver, Mason was driving himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At 18 years old, he already had his driver's license.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when he drove, he gave off a sense of being an adult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? You've been staring at me." He suddenly asked in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I feel like you've really grown up." She murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I've grown up, otherwise do you think I'll always be a kid?" He said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, you're not a kid now, and I don't treat you like one." Veronica said, "Because you're my boyfriend now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, her boyfriend. Even...if someone asked her who she wanted to spend her life with, only his figure would appear in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because she loved him. In these passing years, she slowly fell in love with him, that's why she felt this way!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car arrived at the parking lot of Stanford University, and Veronica followed </span><span>Mason out of the car and headed towards the location of the campus festival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, in a corner of the Stanford University parking lot, Daniel sat in his car, watching Veronica and Mason leave. As expected, the two of them came together to the campus festival.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems like Veronica and Mason's relationship is getting better and better!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is it that after everything, they can still be together, while his life has become a mess? He is not willing to accept it, how could he be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel picked up his phone and sent a text message, "I'm here too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The campus festival at Stanford University is naturally very lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even many students from other schools come to Stanford University to join in the fun. At this moment, Veronica is walking around the campus festival with Mason, looking at the various stalls selling things, feeling quite intrigued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many of the stalls sell things that students have made themselves, which cannot be found outside, giving people a sense of the joy of treasure hunting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you seen anything you like?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They're all pretty interesting. Oh, by the way, can we buy two of the same thing today?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two of the same thing?" he seemed a bit puzzled. "Do you really like that thing so much that you want to buy two?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not like that. It's just because I like it," her face turned red again. Actually, she wanted to buy something for couples, like clothes, shoes, or something else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having the same thing as each other makes it feel like they are closer to each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, she didn't think too much about these things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, at the campus festival, seeing many couples wearing matching clothes, this idea has become stronger and stronger for her.</span></p></div>
