        <h1>Chapter 3262</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But your parents..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you not understand my parents? They thought I would never get married in my lifetime. Now that I am marrying you, they are grateful. So don't worry too much," Brian said as he took Valda's hand and held it tightly. "Valda, I know what is most important to me. You should know that you are the most important thing to me, and nothing can compare to you in my heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt a slight tingling sensation in her nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A prestigious family like his would certainly value their offspring, so it's surprising that he said such words to her. This man's love for her is actually more pure than anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, you are also the most important person to me," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, the results of the blood test are out. When Valda saw the values of those two indicators, even though she hadn't asked the doctor yet, she knew for sure that she was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The previous worries and anxieties have now turned into joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda lowered her head and stared somewhat dazedly at her still-flat belly, where a little life was now growing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Brian, naturally understood the values on the test report, and joyfully hugged Valda, saying "We're going to be parents!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Uh-huh," Valda smiled, but tears couldn't help but well up in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is her dream of a family of three finally coming true? What will her and Brian's child be like?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was so looking forward to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she started crying, he immediately became flustered and said, "Why are you crying? This is a good thing, don't cry, don't cry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... I know it's a good thing, I... I'm just too happy, that's why I'm crying," she choked out, trying hard to stop her tears but unable to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if those are tears of joy, he can't bear to see her cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lifted his hand and wiped away the tears on her face. "Okay, don't cry anymore, don't cry anymore," Brian said softly. As he spoke, he lowered his head and gently kissed away the tears on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Valda had calmed down, the two of them went to see the doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since this is only the first blood test, it can only confirm pregnancy. However, whether the values are good or bad will depend on the results of subsequent blood tests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">We need to draw blood again the next day, and then we will start prenatal check-ups every week.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they returned to the villa, Brian said, "I'll accompany you to your next prenatal check-up. Do you have a preferred hospital for the check-up? If not, I can arrange it. Now that you're pregnant, you should reduce your workload a bit. Also, do you have any cravings or nausea? Would you like to try some sour plum juice? Is there anything else you'd like to eat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A series of questions came out of Brian's mouth, which surprised Valda. Then, Brian directly called his subordinate and asked them to go to the bookstore to buy various books related to pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, Brian called the butler over and said to him, "My wife is pregnant now. Please make sure that the meals prepared by the chef are suitable for pregnant women. Also, if there are any drinks or snacks that can help with morning sickness, please provide them. Additionally, please find a few experienced caregivers who specialize in serving pregnant women, preferably with professional licenses, to take care of Valda's daily life..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda listened, stunned by the exaggeration. Is it really necessary to be so dramatic?</p></div>
