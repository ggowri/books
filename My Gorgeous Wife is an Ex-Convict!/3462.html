        <h1>Chapter 3460</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But isn't Veronica Mason's sister? Even if they're not related by blood, Mason has been living with the Barlow family for so many years and has always called Veronica 'sister'. If Veronica asks Mason for help, he will surely agree," said the elderly Mr. Cross.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel laughed, "Promise what? Promise to help us pay off our debts? That's impossible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, we can't mention the debt issue. Let's just say that we have relatives who supply furniture and we want to discuss business with the Reed family. We just need Veronica's help to make the connection," said Mr. Cross urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel found his father's words laughable. After all, Veronica and Mason were just high school students. Could they really have such a big influence on the business?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Daniel, you must save your father! If we can't pay back this money, I'll end up in jail. The amount is so large that I might even get a life sentence! Do you want to never see your father again?" pleaded Mr. Cross.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old Mrs. Cross, who was crying before, now looked at her son with tears in her eyes and said, "Daniel, regardless of whether things will work out or not, go and plead with Veronica first! If you really try your best and it still doesn't work out, then we...we will accept our fate!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at his parents' expression, Daniel couldn't bring himself to refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment of hesitation, he said, "Okay, I'll give it a try."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He used to believe that love was just about two people loving each other, but now it seems like there are too many other factors involved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Zixi really helped him, is he using Veronica?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Can he and Veronica still have a future together?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Daniel is extremely confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The fifth day of the lunar new year was the day that Daniel and Veronica had agreed to meet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica arrived, Daniel could tell that she had dressed up for the occasion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked especially beautiful today, but there was a hint of weariness and sadness in her expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Is there something that's bothering you?" Daniel asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing, just these past few days, I don't know why, but I keep thinking about things from when Mason and I were kids, and then I feel like now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hesitated and didn't finish her sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about now?" he asked, pressing her for an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing," Veronica pursed her lips. The old her used to think she understood Mason well, but now she's finding it harder and harder to read him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She doesn't understand what he's thinking, and doesn't know his likes and dislikes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel looked at Veronica's expression and hesitated. "Did you have a disagreement with him before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not a disagreement, I just feel like I shouldn't rely on him so much in the future. In the past, my family always relied on our relationship with him to make some money, but we can't do that anymore! I just want to be a simple sister to Mason!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel's body stiffened, feeling like the speech he had prepared for today was stuck in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica doesn't even want the Barlow family to use Mason anymore, so what about his relationship with them? The so-called relatives of his family want to do business with Reed Group, and he has to ask Veronica to talk to Mason about it... how can he even say it out loud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they talked, the two of them had already arrived at the temple.</p></div>
