        <h1>Chapter 3745</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want me to have your company's leader fire him tomorrow?" Mason asked after a moment of contemplation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's body stiffened as she stared at the person in front of her. His words reminded her of what he had done to the Cross family in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Daniel's father's embezzlement was not Mason's doing, he had used it as an </span><span>opportunity to break up with Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This incident became the catalyst for their eventual separation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a deep breath, Veronica said seriously, "No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it because he's your ex-boyfriend?" Mason narrowed his eyes, his expression showing a hint of displeasure. "Do you still have feelings for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, my feelings for him had already ended when we broke up years ago," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Was it out of pity?" he asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it wasn't pity," Veronica continued to deny.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why do you want to work with him?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that I want to work with him, but rather I can empathize with his helplessness," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Helplessness?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe you don't have this feeling, but as an ordinary person like me, I experience it quite often. Sometimes, even if I haven't done anything wrong, I still have to bear all the blame and be forced to accept the other person's demands just because they have a higher status, position, or money. Mason, I just don't want you to use your wealth and status to oppress innocent people," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her with a heavy gaze. "Do you often get treated like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze made her heart beat faster, as if all the blood in her body rushed to her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wouldn't say often... but you know, I work at a talent agency now, and people there are under a lot of pressure, so sometimes they can't help but get angry and blame others," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, how about leaving the company? If you want to work, I can help you find another job," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I've finally adapted to my current job, the salary is good, and I'm about to start my senior year. I can continue to intern at the company and gain work experience. It will make it easier for me to find a job after graduation," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused and looked at him in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why choose a more difficult path? There's no need for that," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Veronica's mind flashed the conversation she had with Daniel before leaving the company today. She licked her dry lips and said, "I just hope that my abilities can become stronger. I don't want to be a parasite. And...I hope that in the future, when I stand by your side and someone introduces me, they won't just say, 'I am so-and-so from Mason,' but can say my name!"</span></p></div>
