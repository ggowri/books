        <h1>Chapter 249</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Evelyn was full of disbelief. What Jason meant was... "You want me to kneel in front of her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there a problem?" Jason asked, raising his eyes lazily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn choked up, and her face turned red. However, she could not utter a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace watched as Evelyn choked up. Was Jason standing up for her? Or was he telling her even though Evelyn had Brian as a backer, he could still get her down on her knees if he wanted to?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, there was another commotion at the entrance of the shooting site.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director turned and looked, not knowing whether to be nervous or relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that the two VIPs would be here today? What the hell was going on today?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He saw a tall figure approaching. The man was dressed in a dark grey overcoat, matching his handsome but indifferent face. If it was not Brian, who else would it be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She did not expect Brian to turn up today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly in surprise at Brian's appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian saw Jason and Grace, he looked calm. It was as if he already knew that they were here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that Evelyn saw Brian, she immediately looked like she had found something to rely on. She rushed to Brian's side, put one arm around his arm, and said in an aggrieved tone, "Brian, why don't you talk to Mr. Reed for me? Mr. Reed&rsquo;s asking me to kneel and grovel as a demonstration for those extras. I followed his wishes and demonstrated it once, but he&rsquo;s still not satisfied. I'm not an extra. I can't keep doing that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn tried to complain as stealthily as possible as she faked being aggrieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not respond to Evelyn but slowly walked over to Jason. He looked at him with those dark eyes. "What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I came to visit someone. Grace is here as an extra today. I heard that your girlfriend complained that the extras were not performing properly previously. She asked Grace to kneel and grovel as a demonstration last time. I just want your girlfriend to show me what the standard movements should look like," Jason said with a half-smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn, looking rather aggrieved, slightly bit her red lip. Her eyes seemed to be covered with a mist. "Brian, Mr. Reed asked me to perform and I did, but Mr. Reed isn't satisfied and keeps asking me to do it all over again. Isn't he just picking on me? If Mr. Reed really dislikes me, then what does it matter if I&rsquo;m in this film?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was trying to retreat for the sake of advancing. The more she showed her weakness at times like this, the more embarrassed people were to suppress her. It could even trigger a man's protective behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to her surprise, Jason simply said, "Alright, then you quit this film."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was dumbfounded. She had no idea that Jason would say that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she turned her eyes to Brian, hoping that her prince could help her. She was just saying she would not do the film. She did not actually mean it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A drama with a production team like this had the potential to become a sensation. Once she acted in it, it meant that she would get a free ride to stardom.</p></div>
