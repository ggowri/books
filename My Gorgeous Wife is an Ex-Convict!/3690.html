        <h1>Chapter 3688</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica instinctively tried to dodge and stepped back, but Angelica threw the pasta with great force, and there was a lot of sauce in it. She closed her eyes instinctively as she saw the sauce about to splash onto her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next moment, she didn't feel the hot sauce splashing on her face. Instead, she heard a gasp from the people around her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly opening her eyes, she saw a broad embrace in front of her, someone had stood in front of her and blocked the sauce that was thrown at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A familiar feeling swept over her, even though she didn't lift her head and didn't know who was standing in front of her, her intuition told her that it was him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... could it be possible? Could it really be him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stiffly lifted her head, and the handsome but cold face came into her view.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was really him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She stared at the face that was so close to her, her eyes filled with shock and disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was he here, and why did he help her block the sauce?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Most of the pasta had splashed onto Mason's expensive suit, and the people around them were surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the perpetrator, Angelica's face showed a hint of panic, but then she saw that Mason was a stranger and said aggressively, "Who are you? I was teaching my assistant a lesson, what are you doing here? Do you want to play the hero and save the beauty?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason ignored Angelica and only looked at Veronica, his gaze deep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even he himself couldn't explain what his behavior was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw that she was about to be splashed with sauce, he didn't even think twice before rushing over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This behavior wasn't something he had thought through, but rather a...instinctive reaction, or you could say it was instinct!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body instinctively protected this woman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he had used hypnosis to diminish the feelings he once had for her, even if he could ignore her when he saw her, when she was in danger, he would instinctively protect her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was that?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica's voice woke Veronica from her shock. She looked at Mason with concern and nervousness, "Are you okay? Did you get burned?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the pasta had been bought for some time, it had been kept in a thermal bag before, so the sauce should still be quite hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Mason replied stiffly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica was furious that she was being ignored, "Who are you? This is the backstage area, not just anyone can come in here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason turned his head and looked at Angelica with a cold gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This glance made Angelica's heart tremble, not just because of the man's handsome </span><span>appearance, but also because of the dead and cold chill in his eyes, which was terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who is this person...?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he a celebrity? Or someone related to the entertainment industry? Angelica desperately tried to think, but she had no impression of this man at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this man was really someone in the industry, with such looks, there was no reason for him not to be famous. At the very least, she should have some impression of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a voice rang out, "Mason!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine had just met her idol, but they had to leave the room so that the idol could fix their clothes and makeup. As they stepped out into the hallway, Jasmine saw her own Mason standing not far away, surrounded by a group of people.</span></p></div>
