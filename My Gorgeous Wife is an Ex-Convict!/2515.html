        <h1>Chapter 2513</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A large reason why she was staying alive was to help Herman catch his killer rather than getting justice for herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's examination report was officially released one week later. The hospital also did a consultation on Grace's current condition. The conclusion was that the pregnancy could go on for now, but they had to monitor it closely, especially the baby's nutrition absorption and the placenta's location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the placenta was not in place, immediate termination might be required.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The results were much better than Grace had expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Jay, don't say anything about my pregnancy until the placenta grows." If the placenta was not in a good position, the pregnancy would have to be terminated as soon as possible. Otherwise, if the placenta ruptured, the baby would die, and so would she.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she wanted to keep the baby while she had the chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," said Jason as he gently took her hand. "Grace, I'm sorry for putting you through this all over again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. "It's nothing. I told you I wanted to give you a home and many children so that our family can be lively and happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only wished for God to have mercy on her and let her deliver the baby safely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've given me everything you promised me," he muttered, pulling her hand to his cheek and gently rubbing it against her palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Reed family was no longer as cold and cheerless as before. There was laughter every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their family would only grow bigger and bigger, becoming happier as well. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What the old master had predicted was wrong after all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reason why humans were humans was that they had weaknesses. One would only have something one cared for and have the chance to experience joys and sorrows if one had weaknesses!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One would only be a machine if one had no weaknesses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, you make me happy. All I'm asking of you is to not take my happiness away, okay?" He murmured, pleading and hoping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't do that. We have to accompany each other for a lifetime!" Grace said as she hugged Jason back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since Kyla was still in the hospital's inpatient department, the two returned to the inpatient department.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked much better than before. She could get out of bed and walk now. She could have a normal diet too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not feed the newborn because of her medication, but she had gone to the neonatal care unit to see her baby through the transparent glass walls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tiny baby looked much weaker than regular babies, especially with tubes attached to her body. The sight of it made her heart ache.</p></div>
