        <h1>Chapter 4378 His Embarrassment</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley took Calvert and left the scene, leaving the film crew and a bunch of people on-site in a daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rumors were circulating in this circle before, suggesting that Calvert got into the modeling industry thanks to Harley. Some even claimed that Harley was the power behind Calvert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people are somewhat skeptical about this kind of statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Calvert himself was quite outstanding even in the modeling world, and he was rapidly growing. Recently, the praise he had received in this industry showed his ever-increasing strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other hand, Harley was a princess in the entertainment industry! Moreover, she was currently the only child in the Hart family. Unless something unexpected happened, the entire entertainment empire of the Hart family would be controlled by Harley in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Such a person had seen too many handsome guys since she was a child. Although Calvert was handsome, he was not the most handsome man in the entertainment industry. In addition, Calvert's family background was not very good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could someone like this really have caught Harley's eye?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that scene just then really dispelled many people's doubts. Calvert truly was someone who could catch Harley's eye!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially the princess of the Hart family, who just recently broke off her engagement!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, a certain thought couldn't help but surface in everyone's hearts: The princess of the Hart family has broken off her engagement, could it be because of Calvert?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was taken to the hospital by Harley to have his facial injuries checked out. Luckily, the injuries weren't severe. It was estimated that it would take about three days for the bruises to completely fade.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank goodness there's no problem." Harley breathed a sigh of relief. After the hospital had given him his prescription, the two of them left the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you..." Calvert said softly, "It's such a coincidence to see you today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, he didn't want her to always see his embarrassing side. If possible, he hoped she could see his better side!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's quite a coincidence," Harley said. Of course, this could also be a result of Lornell's deliberate arrangement. "I was in the coffee shop right across from your filming location. When you guys were shooting, I was at the window on the second floor of the coffee shop, with a perfect view of your set."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Calvert was taken aback. If she had been watching the shoot from the second floor of the cafe earlier, did she also see him kissing other models on set?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, his face suddenly turned pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong, are you feeling unwell?" Harley asked, looking at Calvert's suddenly pale face with some concern. "Maybe we should go back to the hospital for a check-up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said this as she took his hand, intending to go back to the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need," Calvert quickly said, "I'm just a bit embarrassed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Embarrassed?" Harley blinked in confusion. His face was pale at the moment. Rather than looking embarrassed, he seemed more like something had happened that made him worried and scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> what exactly are you feeling embarrassed about?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gently bit his lip, his head bowed, not saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter, can't you talk to me?" Harley suddenly leaned in, staring at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His originally pale face suddenly flushed a shade of red, and even his ears started to turn slightly pink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those ink-black eyes of his, seemed as if veiled by a thin layer of gauze. And the way he was </span><span>slightly biting his lip, he looked just like a pitiful little puppy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley suddenly felt like teasing him!</span></p></div>
