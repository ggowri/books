        <h1>Chapter 540</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he could, he hoped that she would never be sad or cry for the rest of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Little by little, Jason kissed the tears on Grace's face while she stiffened and dared not move. She was feeling only the heat where he had kissed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the end of the film, Grace was a little dizzy. She watched 80% of the film carefully, but in the last 20%, because he was kissing her tears, she did not have the heart to watch that part.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just remembered the scene from the finale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson looked like he wanted more after finishing the film. It was as if he wanted to continue beating the bad guy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace touched the little one's head and thought she had made the right decision to bring him to the premiere today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to meet the actor in the movie with me later? He's the main character who beat the bad guy just now," said Grace as she also signed, explaining to the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," Nelson's mouth clearly uttered this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was once again relieved. Nelson would speak more and more in the future. Maybe it would not be long before he could communicate like ordinary children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace took Nelson and followed Jason. They were led by the staff to the actors' lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They called it a lounge, but it was actually a big room that was like a small hall. Almost all the actors were in the lounge, and Howell Webb was of course among them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director had already spoken to Howell Webb, so he knew that Jason would bring his girlfriend over to take a photo with him and ask for his autograph.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, Howell Webb thought he had misheard the news when he first heard it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The famous Young Master Reed in Emerald City had a girlfriend? This girlfriend was even his fan? Howell Webb had mixed feelings about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never had the chance to meet someone like Jason up close, but now, thanks to a fan, he was going to meet the famous Young Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're Mr.Reed, aren't you? Hello, I'm Howell Webb." Howell Webb smiled as he stepped forward, then he turned his eyes to Grace. He said, "I heard Director Stevens mention that you're a fan. It's really my pleasure. Hello."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, I... I've seen the TV series you starred in a long time ago. Uh, it was when you first debuted. I didn't think one day I'd be able to talk to you like this," Grace said, suddenly a little nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, someone she had only seen on TV and the big screen was suddenly right before her eyes. It was hard not to feel a little nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, thank you!" Howell Webb said with a smile, "Why don&rsquo;t we have our photo taken first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," said Grace, then she conveniently handed her phone to Jason who was at the side. "Take some photos for me, Jay. Uh, take a few more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, the people around them, especially some actresses, felt a little jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Young Master Reed as the photographer? She even said it so naturally?! If it was some other women, they could not wait to please him! Was she not afraid of making Young Master Reed angry?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason just grabbed her phone and... Started taking photos!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, the actresses felt even more jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people looked at Grace and did not find her attractive. She was at best comely, easy on the eyes, and just comfortable to look at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the entertainment industry, there were so many prettier women than Grace!</p></div>
