        <h1>Chapter 3692</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... comics are comics, and Mason isn't... Anyway, he doesn't want to kiss Chandler, but if they did, it would look pretty good..." Tina muttered to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two women thought they were whispering quietly, but they didn't realize that the two men could hear them clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was relatively calm, still looking cold and indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Chandler was speechless, wondering what they were talking about. And what kind of book did Tina show Jasmine?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the concert ended, Tina had planned to chat with Jasmine a bit more, but Chandler immediately pulled her into the car. "Alright, I'll take Tina home first. We can talk another time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, I'm not in a hurry to go home. I still have things to talk to Jasmine about," Tina protested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever you have to say, you can say it another time," Chandler replied, closing the car door and driving away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine then went back to the car with Mason and asked, "Mason, should we say goodbye to Veronica?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason replied coldly, "No need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, do you really not like Veronica anymore?" Jasmine asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her memory, when she was still young, she vaguely remembered that Mason liked </span><span>Veronica very much. Many times when Mason came to their house, Veronica would come along, and Mason would smile at her, even though he didn't smile at others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Mason always liked to hold Veronica's hand. Wherever Veronica went, he followed her like a tail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, when Mason faced Veronica, he was so indifferent that it made her feel unreal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I don't like her anymore," Mason replied flatly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of hypnosis?" Jasmine asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was somewhat surprised and glanced at her. "How do you know?" After all, in his opinion, his little sister was still young. Although he had no intention of hiding anything, he didn't expect his little sister to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard my sister and brother-in-law talk about it," Jasmine said. "Mason, can hypnosis really make a person go from liking to not liking someone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason pursed his thin lips. Chandler had asked him the same question today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it were in the past, he could have answered "yes" without hesitation. But today, the word "yes" seemed to be stuck in his throat and was difficult to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in his mind, he flashed back to the scene where he instinctively rushed to Veronica's side today and blocked the bowl of pasta that was thrown at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did he still have such instincts when he clearly no longer liked her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason?" Jasmine spoke again after not getting a response for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason snapped out of his thoughts. "I have no feelings for her anymore, so don't mention her in front of me again in the future," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence was like he was talking to his little sister, but it was more like he was talking to himself. Yes, he had no feelings for that woman anymore!</span></p></div>
