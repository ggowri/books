        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the contrary, Harley had a clear affection for Lornell, but it seemed like he couldn't get a </span><span>response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he is not interested in the feelings of others and has no desire for gossip, Tina seems to be quite concerned about Harley, and part of Lornell's engagement with Harley is due to his relationship with Tina, which is why he said so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about the relationship between Harley and me, "Lornell said</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just getting married because of this? "Chandler frowned slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise? "Lornell chuckled lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, exploring medicine is much more interesting!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the person in front of him, Chandler knew that Lornell and he were different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His love for Tina grew over time, and he never resisted it, so it grew stronger and stronger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lornell, he didn't fall in love with Harley!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> if one day Harley doesn't like you, then your engagement will be meaningless, "Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell said lightly, "I don't care if she likes me or not. For me, the Hart family is just a good marriage partner, let alone the Quentin family's engagement, it's not something that can be broken at will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if she doesn't like you, do you still have to marry her? "Chandler asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell thought for a moment and said, "That's not true, but I don't intend for her to easily repent. After all, since we have made an agreement, we must abide by it, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Quentin family values the agreement, and Chandler is also clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's just a matter of emotions, not something that can be bound by an agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if Harley insists on breaking his engagement with you? "Chandler asked, after all, Harley is the youngest daughter of the Hart family and is highly favored. If he really wants to break his engagement, the Hart family will probably do everything possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as the Hart family can afford it, so can it, "Lornell said casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at the person in front of him and said, "Lornell, no matter what, you take Harley seriously. I hope in the future, you won't have any regrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Lornell casually smiled and said, "I have always taken her seriously, but I don't have that kind of affection for her. However, I will do whatever my </span><span>fianc&eacute;e</span><span> should do, so naturally there won't be any regrets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler listened to his answer and didn't say anything more, then turned around and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell playing with the medicine bottle in his hand, regret it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he just said, he feels like he has done everything he needs to do, so what is there to regret?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the fact that Harley likes him and has loved him for so many years is all too clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he doesn't really care if she likes him or not, it would be better if she liked him, at least to ensure the stability of this engagement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The existence of her </span><span>fianc&eacute;e</span><span> has indeed helped him fend off many troubles.</span></p></div>
