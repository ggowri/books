        <h1>Chapter 648</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, Grandma did not finish her last words. Her eyes and her mouth were still open, but she was no longer breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly as tears fell from her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctors and nurses beside them determined the time of her grandmother's death and said to Grace, "Our condolences, Miss Cummins."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Condolences&hellip;' The only family who loved her was gone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly let out a yell and laid beside her grandmother's still-warm body while crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body... Was still warm, but she was not breathing nor did she have a heartbeat. She could no longer hear Grandma calling her Grace and she could not see her smiling at her anymore...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace cried while Jason stood by in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew that she had too many tears to let out right now. Her grandmother was a spiritual support to her. She was her protector after the loss of her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she would never see her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He understood the pain of losing a loved one. When his father was frozen to death in front of his eyes, he only felt as if he was left alone in the whole world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even later when he acknowledged his biological family and was accepted back into the Reed family, he never had a sense of belonging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps death was a relief to his father who loved his mother so much that it was painful for him to live after losing his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he forgot that he still had a child and gave all his feelings to the woman. What he left to the child was just a suicide note&mdash;A suicide note indicating his identity and how he wished he could return to the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace cried for a long time. Eventually, her tears seemed to have dried up, leaving only tearless crying and choking sobs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let your grandmother leave in peace, Grace," Jason finally said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sobbed, her eyes red and swollen. "Yes, I must let Grandma... Leave in peace..." she said. Finally, she reluctantly covered her grandmother's face with her hand to close her eyes and mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grandma loved me very much," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know," he said, gently pulling her into his arms. "Me too. I'll love you and protect you more than anyone else in the world, so don't cry, all right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her red and swollen eyes, he felt a pang in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would give anything to keep her from crying if he could, but he had no idea how to stop her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know what? Your tears make me feel as if it hurts to breathe." Jason lowered his head and gently kissed Grace's red, swollen eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop crying. I'll heal all your wounds.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how long it would take her to heal, he would be there for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would keep her safe all his life&mdash;As he had promised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p></div>
