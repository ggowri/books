        <h1>Chapter 818</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin's face paled as he immediately lunged right in front of Lina, saying, "Master Reed, Lina's just doing this for her friend. If it has irritated you, I'll bear the consequences for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin, I don't need you to help me. I can bear the consequences myself!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How are you going to do that?! What do you think you can bear?" Hadwin said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll just let him beat me to a pulp! I'm mentally prepared for that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, are you trying to piss me off?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin found that his temper, which had always been under control previously, would always go haywire when it came to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared coldly at Lina, clearly not intending to let her go that easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace, who was so drunk that she had fallen asleep, suddenly rubbed her head against Lina's shoulder. She said in a mutter, "Lina... Don't be afraid... I'll protect Lina..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's eyes reddened immediately. 'She still wants to protect me even if she&rsquo;s drunk?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared intently at the drunk Grace. A moment later, he turned around and left without saying a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence, who was next to him, quickly followed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina felt a layer of cold sweat on her back when she was blown by the cold wind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You were lucky just now. You might not be so lucky next time," Hadwin said to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip. 'I know I got lucky. Jason only let me go because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If it weren&rsquo;t for Grace's words, I&rsquo;d probably have to face tragic consequences!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, get in the car first," said Hadwin. The pair helped Grace into the car before driving in the direction of the rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they arrived at Grace's house, Lina helped her best friend to change into her pajamas. After tucking Grace in, she left the rental house with Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they got into the car, Lina spoke up first before Hadwin could speak. "I know I was reckless today, but I just couldn't help it. When I think about how much pain he caused Grace, I just... really want to beat him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But he's Jason, Jason of Emerald City!" said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Grace's my best friend!" Lina's voice was a little muffled. It was as if this stood for everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin's eyes flashed with shock. He always knew that Lina and Grace were very close. When Grace was in prison, this girl could give up the opportunity to study abroad and run back to work on Grace's case. This sacrifice was not something any friend could do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought that was the limit of the friendship between the two women, but it turned out to be more than that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you willing to do so much for her?" Hadwin's voice cracked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because Grace chose to trust me when I was at my most helpless," said Lina. The scene of that year seemed to appear before her eyes.</p></div>
