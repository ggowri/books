        <h1>Chapter 1752</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Late at night, Secretary Wang was taken to a room in the detention center, where the only source of light was a lamp that shone a bright yellow glow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was sitting on a chair in front of a table, staring at Secretary Wang with cold eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The prison guard who brought Secretary Wang here left the room and closed the door, leaving only Secretary Wang and Jason inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You seem to know I would come," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I didn&rsquo;t, but you must have something to ask me if you&rsquo;re here to see me, Young Master," Secretary Wang said with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mason is my and Grace's child. Who else besides you knows about this?" asked Jason as he stared straight at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If an ordinary person was stared at like this by Jason, they would probably feel some pressure. However, Secretary Wang looked relaxed. "I don't understand what you're talking about, Young Master."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You don't?" Jason got up and approached Secretary Wang. He raised his hand and grabbed Secretary Wang's head before slamming it against the table. "Who else knows that Mason is my son? What were you up to when you took Mason away? Did you play a part in Mason's kidnapping today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A series of questions escaped Jason's mouth. His cold voice had become ruthless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang looked like a mess right now, but he burst into laughter. "What's the matter? Was the child kidnapped? But you're wrongly accusing me, Young Master. Everything I&rsquo;ve done has been for the Reed family.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"For the Reed family? You&rsquo;re doing this for the Reed family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You can't put all your eggs in the same basket. Young Master, you must know that, don't you? That's why I separated the three children. But don't underestimate the boy I took away, Young Master. I spent a lot of time and effort teaching that boy. He&rsquo;s cruel, cold-blooded, and has no regard for life. I made him kill a lot of small animals when he was as young as two years old."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Jason felt a surge of anger when he heard this. He rarely got angry in recent years, but he was now furious. "And you say everything is for the Reed family? Who told you to do it for the Reed family? Who are you to do that to my child?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was only then he understood why Mason, who was only five years old, was so different from other children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What had Secretary Wang done to the boy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The Reed family needs a strong heir who&rsquo;s ruthless and tough enough to make the Reed family more powerful. Old Master will probably like the child too if he met him&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason interrupted Secretary Wang, "That's enough! Old Master is dead. I'm in charge of the Reed family now, and it's up to me to decide what kind of heir the Reed family needs! Everything you&rsquo;ve done is pointless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang said, "Young Master, you wouldn't have said that before you knew Grace! Back then, you were someone who would do anything for profits. Otherwise, how could you have let Grace go to jail knowing that she was innocent?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once he finished, Jason pulled Secretary Wang out of the chair and banged him against the wall nearby. "If you say one more word about this, I'll make sure you can't speak another word for the rest of your life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This was something that had always bothered him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang chuckled. "What's the matter? Young Master, are you still uneasy even now? Now that Grace has returned to you, why are you still uneasy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's thin lips were pressed into a straight line. "I'm just asking you who else knows that Mason is my son. You&rsquo;ve always been cautious. You probably wouldn&rsquo;t have told too many people about this. Is it the doctor who performed the C-section on Grace? Or someone who has been working for you and is now hiding somewhere? Or... Lily, who conspired with you back then?"</p></div>
