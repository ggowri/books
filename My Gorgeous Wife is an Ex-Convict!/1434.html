        <h1>Chapter 1433</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you... hate me that much?" he murmured, wishing he could hear her say no.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, what he heard was... "Yes, I just never want to see you again.."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If... I hadn't forced you to kneel and grovel to Paisley Daniels in front of the Daniels family the other day, would it still have been possible for us to turn things around? Would you have been willing to forgive me?" His voice was utterly hoarse, and he felt as though there was a lump in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she just looked at him coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I'll make up for the humiliation you&rsquo;ve suffered. I only ask that you forgive me. At the very least, don't reject my liver!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As he finished speaking, his knees hit the ground and he knelt in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn's eyes widened immediately as she looked at the person in front of her with surprise. She gasped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She never expected Martin Weiss to kneel like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, she watched him lower his head and grovel at her. One... Two... Three...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He kept hitting his head on the ground and the sounds continuously rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although it was past three in the afternoon and few people were walking around in the neighborhood, there were still people who passed by occasionally. They could not help but stop to watch and speculate after seeing Martin Weiss groveling to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn had no idea how many times Martin Weiss had hit his head on the ground. She would be lying if she said that she was not shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, it seemed almost impossible for a proud man like him to do something like this in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the impossible was happening in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Every time he looked up, she could see that his forehead was injured and blood was oozing from the wound slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was more and more blood!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn took a deep breath and said slowly, "Even if you do this, you still can't afford to make it up for me. If you do feel guilty, just don't bother me anymore. Don't argue with me for Nelson again. I'll entrust Nelson to Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His body suddenly stiffened, and he looked up at her blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You'll have other children. You can have as many as you want, but Nelson is the only one I have. I want him to grow up happily, so I don't want to give him to you," she said as if she were just calmly stating a fact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, every word seemed to cut his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I'll never have another child in my life! I'll only have one child, which is Nelson. I'll seek famous doctors from all over the world and find a way to restore Nelson's hearing. There must be a way!" Martin Weiss said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Nelson was the only connection between him and her. "I know I hurt Nelson with some of the things I said previously, but... I don't dislike him. I actually like... I like Nelson a lot. I've loved him since the first time I met him when I didn't even know he was our child. I feel differently for him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe it was the father and son bond. Even though he had no idea Nelson was his flesh and blood back then, he still had compassion for Nelson and wanted to be kind to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Whatever happens between you and Nelson in the future is between you and him. I won&rsquo;t be there to see it, but&hellip; just don&rsquo;t hurt him!&rdquo; Kyla Corbyn paused. Her red lips had gently uttered the cruelest words to him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Also, don't show up at my funeral after I die and don't come to my grave. I don't want to see you whether I'm alive or dead!"</p></div>
