        <h1>Chapter 116</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once he was done talking, he ended the call.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Reed stared at the phone in his hand for some time before passing it to the attendant nurse.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I shouldn't worry? It would be great if it were true and yet sometimes, his lack of self-awareness is the most terrifying thing. Just like my son all those years ago who promised me: 'Dad, I will never forgo the Reed family's responsibilities for a woman.'</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And yet, ultimately, my son abandoned the Reed family for a woman. He didn't even want his life!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Look into it and find out who that woman is. I want to know every single detail about that woman," Mr. Reed ordered calmly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes," said a man wearing a black suit and gold-rimmed glasses who was sitting in the corner of the hospital room, his fingers rapidly flying across the laptop keyboard.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace lay in the hospital bed, her mind still in a mess. After all, plenty of things had happened within the span of a day and she could not come to her senses.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The doctor and nurse had just visited to run some basic tests on her, taking some of her blood and conducting some examinations. Only in the afternoon, after the blood test results had come out, could they determine her condition.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, someone gently knocked at the door to her room and then pushed it open to enter.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace studied the young man dressed in a suit and tie who looked fair and gentle. "He's probably only a few years older than me."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man looked at Grace with a smile and said, "Nice to meet you, Miss Cummins. I am Terrence... 'Jason's' secretary. This is your phone and bag. Can you please check the items in your bag and confirm that nothing is missing?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he spoke, he put her things in the storage space at Grace's headboard. Just as he was about to leave, Grace suddenly called after him. "Who... who is 'Jason'?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence respectfully replied, "You'll know when you have to, Miss Cummins. I'm just a secretary."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace changed the topic of conversation and asked, "Then do you know the situation at my family's old residence?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence did not avoid her question. "Your uncles and aunt, as well as their spouses and children, have been temporarily detained. Originally your grandfather was also detained by the police but due to his advanced age, and in order to have someone by your grandmother's side to take care of her, he was released on bail."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was surprised. "I didn't know that suddenly so many people would be detained. At home... the only person who actually stood up for me was Grandma."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Grace recalled the scene of the previous night, bitterness flashed through her heart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Furthermore, the Miller family is also currently being detained at the police station," Terrence added.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Terrence left the ward, Grace looked around the spacious room. "A high-class VIP ward and a personal secretary. Moreover, there was more than one doctor who came to check on me just now. There were several of them and they were all chief physicians.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Furthermore, there were signs of them taking great care and showing respect in their attitudes when they were treating me.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm sure they weren't respectful because of my identity. They only did so because I have the support of 'Jason'.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Who the hell is Jason?!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace felt as if her mind was even more muddled. She then picked up her bag that had been placed at the headboard and remembered that it had been left at her grandmother's house.</p></div>
