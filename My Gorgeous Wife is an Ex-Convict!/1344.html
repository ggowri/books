        <h1>Chapter 1343</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could imagine how much determination Kyla had to make up her mind to give Nelson&rsquo;s custody to Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla would not have made this decision if she were not suffering from an illness that was extremely difficult to cure!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A look of surprise flashed in Jason's eyes. "What's wrong with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace muttered, "Stage three liver cancer. Only a liver transplant can save her, but Kyla has a unique blood type that makes it difficult to find a suitable liver."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she sniffled and looked up at Jason. "Jay, can you look up one more thing for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at the red eyes of the woman in front of him and the layer of tears in them. "Sure, I'll do anything you want, but don't cry, okay?" Her tears only made his heart ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he knew she was shedding tears because she was worried about Kyla Corbyn, but... But it still made him jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want her to shed tears for others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sobbed a little and calmed herself down before saying, "I just found out Kyla has donated her bone marrow before, but it was an anonymous donation. Kyla doesn&rsquo;t know who she donated her bone marrow to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a glint in Jason's eyes when he heard this. "Do you suspect that Kyla Corbyn donated her bone marrow to Martin Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, he could read her mind without saying much. Grace nodded and said, "Yeah, I do suspect that. After all, it's too much of a coincidence. Paisley Daniels donated her bone marrow, Kyla also donated hers, and Paisley Daniels's ex-boyfriend happened to be a doctor at the hospital where Martin Weiss was treated."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The series of coincidences forced her to overthink it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "Okay, I'll look into it. Now, you can relax. Stop feeling upset."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he raised his hand and his fingers caressed her eyes. "You have a check-up later. Didn't the doctor tell you to keep a happy mood during the pregnancy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace replied. She only hoped it was just what she suspected with Kyla. If so, then... Kyla might have a chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the hospital, Grace had a routine check-up before getting another progesterone shot in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After receiving injections for some time, the three babies in her belly were currently developing well, but her stomach had too many injection wounds. Her belly was even a little bruised from the injections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he had seen her receive injections many times before, he would still get nervous and his body would stiffen. His hands would sweat every time he saw the long thin needle prick into her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never felt nervous no matter how dangerous the situation was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... it was only when it came to her. He would get nervous whenever it came to her.</p></div>
