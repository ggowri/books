        <h1>Chapter 2932</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of a head hitting the door made the family of three in the hospital room turn towards the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The door opened a crack, and a head slowly poked out from the gap, revealing Valda Theller, the main character that Madam Hart had mentioned earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry... um, I didn't mean to eavesdrop," Valda Theller said, looking embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had just returned from Camille's hospital room and happened to overhear them talking about her. She didn't want to intrude, so she stood outside the door, planning to wait until they finished talking before going in. But then she heard Madam Hart say something about offering herself, and she stumbled, hitting her head on the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller," Brian Hart called out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing her son's words, Mr. and Madam Hart immediately recognized who this woman was, even though they had known of her existence for a long time, this was their first meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Madam Hart said, "Since you're here, come in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller pushed the door open and walked up to Mr. and Madam Hart, politely saying, "Uncle and Auntie Hart, hello."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not okay. My son was injured for you, and you broke up with him. How can I be okay?" Madam Hart retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, whether to break up or not is a matter of the children's feelings. As for my son's injury, Brian Hart said it was willingly done," Mr. Hart said, trying to smooth things over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The couple were both scrutinizing Valda Theller at the moment. The woman in front of them had a slightly timid expression on her face, with a small round face and round eyes that made her look both delicate and cute, but she was completely different from Grace in appearance and temperament.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Originally, they thought that their son had found a woman who looked or had a similar temperament to Grace. After all, their son had loved Grace for so many years. But who would have thought that the woman who broke up with their son and made him willingly get hurt would be this little woman in front of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Speaking of which, why did you break up with my son?" Madam Hart asked Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the eyes of a mother, her own son was always the best. In fact, their son was tall and handsome, with outstanding education, family background, and abilities. No matter how you looked at it, he shouldn't be the one who got dumped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um, Brian Hart and I... um, are not very compatible," Valda Theller found a more dignified way to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not compatible...," Madam Hart murmured, "then what's wrong with my son? Is it because he's not good-looking? Or is he not gentle and considerate enough to you? I have to say, although my son has the potential to be a playboy, he is definitely not one. And once he truly cares for someone, he will treat that person very well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I know that Brian Hart is very good, and he's very good to me too, it's just..." Valda Theller hesitated, she couldn't tell his parents that her feelings for him were far less than what he had for Grace.</p></div>
