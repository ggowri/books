        <h1>Chapter 1774</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But I don't like them," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why not? They're good people," Veronica Barlow said in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"They'll separate me from you, won't they? Then I can't be with you anymore. I don't like them, and I don't want them to be my daddy and mommy." Mason stretched out his hands and hugged Veronica Barlow as he spoke. He buried his little face in her chest, full of attachment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He seemed to have gone back to being a docile kitten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Mason said this, Veronica Barlow looked sad. She looked at Jason and Grace, asking, "Uncle Reed, aunt Cummins, are you going to take Mason away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mason is our son. He&rsquo;ll naturally have to acknowledge his biological family and return to the Reed family, but you can meet anytime you want," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't want to return to the Reed family. I just want to be with Sis," Mason said sternly as his hands held Veronica Barlow tighter. The eyes he used to stare at Jason and Grace grew more hostile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">To him, his so-called daddy and mommy were just enemies trying to separate him from his sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then we'll think of a way to achieve the best of both worlds. For example, Veronica can come and live with the Reed family. Then you can be together every day," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason's black eyes lit up immediately, while Veronica Barlow looked a little dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Am I going to the Reed family to be with Mason every day?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mason, Daddy and I are not your enemies. We&rsquo;ll be the ones who love you the most. We'll protect you and let you grow up well," Grace said to the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason was silent, but his eyes fell on Grace's hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He did not remember seeing her hands wrapped in so much gauze the last time he saw her. Now, her hands had the same white gauze and bandages as his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Did this woman get hurt saving me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is this... my mommy?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace came out of the inpatient department, the He family eagerly came up to her as if they wanted to get some credit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said coldly, "You should be glad that the He family still has Veronica Barlow. Otherwise, do you think you can still stand here and say nonsense?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Well... We're still Mason's adoptive parents at the very least. Even if we can&rsquo;t claim credit, we still made an effort!" muttered Rosalind Bush. Her wrists were still in casts, but instead of resting in the hospital bed, she waited here to meet Jason and his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Effort?" Jason sneered. "What effort did you make? You were paid to raise a child. You received enough money to hire a nanny to wait on him 24/7, yet you beat my son up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It was... It was for Mason's own good. We were just afraid he would get into trouble," Rosalind Bush said in defense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason ordered his subordinates, "Besides Veronica Barlow, none of the He family are allowed to enter this hospital during Mason's hospitalization!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Reed, you're..." shouted Archer Barlow.</p></div>
