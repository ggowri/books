        <h1>Chapter 3056</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she heard a hoarse shout coming from the shore, it was Brian's voice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked towards the shore and saw a figure that she was extremely familiar with, the person she loved more than life itself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian saw Valda toss the baby into the cradle, he understood Valda's decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She intends to sacrifice herself to save Jasmine!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, how could someone like her possibly give up someone else's life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But he doesn't want to! He doesn't want her to make this kind of choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, he would rather have her give up Jasmine and choose to save herself! He wants her to live! He wants her to live!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he has to face the Reed family's accusations and Grace's pain in the future, he still wants her to live!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost instinctively, Brian ran towards the river, intending to jump in and swim towards Valda!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't!" Valda saw Brian's intention and shouted sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as he was about to jump into the water, the police suddenly tackled him and brought him down to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't go, the water from the reservoir is about to rush over, you won't be able to swim back!" The head of the police said. At this point, even the baby would probably only be able to barely make it back to the shore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was simply no time left!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda saw Brian being held down on the ground, she finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Out of the corner of her eye, she could see the surging water rushing towards her, about to reach her any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But the choice she made was the best she could do right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was an orphan with few friends, and even if she really died, it wouldn't cause too much pain to those around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But if something happened to Jasmine, it would be a permanent shadow for Grace and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let go of me, let go of me, I need to save Valda!" Brian struggled desperately, his phoenix eyes turning a deep crimson, his handsome face contorted with anxiety and worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's eyes were filled with tears as she looked at Brian from afar. It was enough that he was so worried about her. Enough! It was really enough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before, she always wished that he could fall in love with her earlier, thinking that if he really loved her, she would be the happiest person at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now, she still feels that if he didn't fall in love with her and only liked her, then when she dies, he will be sad for a while but eventually he can move on from that sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, thank you for liking me, but please don't be sad for me! One day, you will definitely meet someone whom you will truly fall in love with again!" At that moment, she almost shouted these words at him with all her might!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hopes that one day he will find his own happiness and live a good life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her intensely, even though he was being held down by someone else. His fingers were still trying their best to move forward, wanting to use all his remaining strength to get closer to her and save her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if there is no hope at all, he still wants to save!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If something really happened to her, how could he not be sad? And how could he possibly meet someone he could truly fall in love with again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I don't know! He won't meet that person again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because he had already met her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no one else but her!</p></div>
