        <h1>Chapter 2483</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't do humiliating things if you&rsquo;re afraid of being humiliated." George Gregory walked to the desk and sat down. "Did you come to my office at this particular time to ask me to help the Mitchell family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm your wife, and we have a son together. Isn't it natural that you help the Mitchell family and me?" Louise Mitchell said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing in this world is natural, just like how it wasn't natural when I married you," George Gregory said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's expression changed. "Are you blaming me for using my pregnancy... to get you to marry me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory did not answer the question but said indifferently, "The Gregory family won't do anything to help the Mitchell family now that you&rsquo;re in such a state. It won&rsquo;t be good for the Gregory family if we make a move.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Listening to his cold voice, he only seemed to be analytically talking about the pros and cons of the matter! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell felt a chill in her heart. 'Does the man have to be so indifferent even at this time? If the woman who married him had been Amber Mitchell, would he still be so indifferent if the Mitchell family was in trouble?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Louise Mitchell eventually swallowed her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If the Mitchell family is in trouble, it&rsquo;ll affect the projects that the Mitchell and Gregory families are working on. The Gregory family will also suffer huge losses," said Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory said nothing, apparently having anticipated the losses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell said, "So, you don't care about Simon either? If he has a mother who has been to prison, do you think he&rsquo;ll still be able to remain in Deer City's high society? Everyone will probably laugh at him behind his back! Having an ex-convict as a mother will be a stain he can never get rid of!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's eyes narrowed, and the chill in his eyes intensified. "It&rsquo;s true that the Mitchell family sent Amber Mitchell to a mental hospital when she wasn&rsquo;t mentally ill, then?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Louise Mitchell admitted it truthfully this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" he asked sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis held 35% of Mitchell Group's shares. If my sister took over the company, how could my father, my mother, and I be able to live a good life? You know how much she hated us!" Louise Mitchell said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's heart sank. He knew this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it just because of the shares?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's also because I love you. But even though Amber Mitchell broke your heart, you still didn't break off your engagement. I wanted to give you a way out and give myself a chance," said Louise Mitchell. It even seemed as though she did everything for George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." George Gregory got mad. "I didn't ask you to give me a way out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you have married Amber Mitchell if she wasn&rsquo;t admitted to the mental hospital? Would you have married someone who betrayed your feelings?" Louise Mitchell asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory was speechless. Even he was not sure whether he would have married Amber Mitchell if that incident had not happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he hated Amber Mitchell's betrayal, he loved her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell paused before saying, "The doctors who diagnosed Amber Mitchell are unreachable. Others might have already gotten to them, just like what happened with the attending doctor. There might be more evidence online against the Mitchell family. If the investigation goes on and I&rsquo;m sent to prison, Simon will have a criminal mother. Do you have the heart to do that to him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory was silent as he pondered it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell did not urge him. She knew how much the Gregory family valued Simon. If George Gregory still did not do anything, she would go to the Gregory family's elders. They probably would not want their grandson to have his mother be convicted and go to prison. </p></div>
