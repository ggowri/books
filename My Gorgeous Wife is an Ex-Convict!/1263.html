        <h1>Chapter 1262</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his hand was still clutching Grace's hand, and his grip was getting increasingly tighter. It was when she cried out in pain that he immediately came back to his senses and quickly let go. "Does it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright. What was on your mind?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gaze fell on her face. What should he tell her? He had been wondering what she would think of him if his grandfather told her the truth about the accident. Would she still say she would never leave him as firmly as before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his hand, and his cool fingers touched her cheek. He pressed her face into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You said you'll always stay with me, and if you can't do that, then I'll... probably choose to die with you," he muttered. There was a hint of uneasiness in his hoarse voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only smell Jason's scent in her nose. What she could hear was not only his voice but also the beating of his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was unusually intense!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had not expected him to say such threatening words to Old Master Reed. However, watching him defend her and the babies made her feel warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed to have not experienced this warm feeling for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's not going to happen because I'm not leaving," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For an instant, he only felt the unease in his heart fading gradually because of what she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps only she could give him peace of mind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's birthday party was nothing short of bustling despite her hideous appearance trending online yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the invitations had already been sent out long ago. While many people in the trending post&rsquo;s comments section speculated whether Stella and Brian had fallen out, Brian did not clarify anything so everything was still undetermined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, those who received the invitation attended. Many were here to see if Brian would come to the party and if Stella had fallen out of favor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella hired a top makeup artist and applied lots of powder to cover up the bruises on her face, but the swelling had not gone down overnight. Even a skilled makeup artist could not make her swollen face look like it was not swollen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was nothing Stella could do but clench her teeth in anger at the thought of Grace and Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was wearing a custom-made purple gown. Since purple was Brian's favorite color, she would naturally cater to his taste.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The guests Stella invited today were all top celebrities, directors, and owners of film and television companies, making the party a star-filled event that naturally attracted many journalists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was what Stella wanted. She wanted to clear her humiliation at her birthday party today and let everyone know that she was the woman Brian cared about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The guests would deliberately mention Brian and ask if he would be here when they talked to Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Faced with such questions, Stella could only fake a smile and say calmly, "Of course, he will. How could Brian not come to my birthday party? Brian even organized the birthday party today for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as time went by, Brian never appeared, and Stella's smiling face grew stiffer and stiffer.</p></div>
