        <h1>Chapter 3648</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper felt like he had a nice dream, dreaming of her going back to her childhood and playing games with William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them played for a long time, and when they got tired, they slept together just like when they were kids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, wake up." Familiar voice sounded in her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm... let me sleep a bit more, I'm so tired, just another half an hour..." Jasper muttered, turned over, and didn't even open her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, wake up first." That voice seemed to become more helpless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mmm... this voice is William's voice!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's groggy head finally started to react a little bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how did William's voice come to her at this moment? Right, last night, for some reason, she couldn't fall asleep, so she went to the guest room to check on how William was sleeping, and then...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper suddenly opened her eyes and indeed, she saw William's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it was early in the morning, with his slightly messy hair, this face gave Grace a sense of great beauty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the expression on his face at the moment seemed a bit strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper yawned and said, "What's wrong? We just slept together for one night, it's not like we haven't slept together before. Mmm... I still want to sleep a little longer. After all, I have a break from school, I don't have to rush to class."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she actually intended to close her eyes again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A voice suddenly sounded, "If I were you, I wouldn't say that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's body suddenly stiffened, this voice... her big brother?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat up abruptly and saw Mick standing right in front of the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what made her sweat even more was that her parents were standing beside her big brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was instantly at a loss for words to describe his feelings, it was like a mix of emotions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Dad, why did you come here so early?" Jasper chuckled nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that early, we were just waiting for you to have breakfast." Jason said, "We couldn't find you in your room, and then we found out that William came yesterday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he said that, Jason sniffed and glared at his daughter and William, who was sitting next to her with a blanket covering him, not in a good mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although William was a child he had seen grow up since childhood, and he was optimistic about both children, it did not mean that he would be happy to see this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Jason felt that the cabbage he had worked so hard to raise was being stolen by someone else's pig before it could be harvested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper awkwardly said, "It's because William came here too late yesterday, and his health wasn't very good, so I let him in, had him eat something, and then let him sleep in the guest room for the night."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about you, why are you sleeping in the guest room?" Jason asked angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I just couldn't sleep in the middle of the night, so I came to check on William..." Jasper licked his dry lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Check on him?" Jason raised an eyebrow, "And while checking on him, you ended up sleeping together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We didn't do anything! Both of us were wearing our pajamas just fine!" Jasper defended herself. But as she spoke, she still felt a bit guilty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she hadn't really done nothing. She had kissed him last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she said that, Mick, who had been silently watching the scene, burst out laughing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, everyone in the room turned their gaze towards Mick.</span></p></div>
