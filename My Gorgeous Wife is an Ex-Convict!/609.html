        <h1>Chapter 608</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the study, the photo of Brian holding Grace in his arms was on the computer screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes were fixed on the photo on the screen. In the end, he did not say anything about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had not asked her why she did not tell him about it that day, why Brian hugged her, and why Brian cried in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he afraid that the answer he would hear from her would be something he did not want to hear?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason unconsciously gave a wry smile at the thought. When had he become so timid?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like today, when he stepped into the clothing shop and saw Brian holding Grace. His body trembled uncontrollably as he listened to what Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The last thing he wanted to see was Brian recognizing Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having known Brian for so many years, he knew how persistent Brian was when it came to matters regarding the girl he was looking for. He was persistent to the point of paranoia!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was scared because he cared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, in the future, the more you care about someone, the timider you become." In a trance, his father's voice seemed to ring in his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Timid?" He had not understood why back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, you'll become timid and you'll be afraid of losing it. That's when you have the so-called weakness," his father said, stroking his head with his big hand. "However, life is pretty boring if you don't have anyone to care about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Must we&hellip; Have a weakness?" he asked back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wish you'll have one, if possible," his father said, "Just like how your mother is my weakness too, but I've willingly made her my weakness. Just being looked at and loved by her gives me a thrill of excitement and joy. I hope someone will give you that feeling someday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that point, his mother had not abandoned his father. Although they were driven out of the Reed family and were living a poor, difficult life outside, the way his father spoke of his mother with a face of enthusiasm and happiness was still vivid in his memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was in sharp contrast to his father's depression later on and the misery he experienced when he died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Weaknesses... Could be deadly. When he was young, he learned this lesson from his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he never wanted to have any weakness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone he cared about... He did not need someone like that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought he would be like this for the rest of his life, but now Grace seemed to have become his weakness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His emotions seemed to be manipulated by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the phone Jason left lying on his desk rang. Jason pressed on the answer button and Terrence's voice sounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We got it, Young Master Reed. The person who sent the emails to the news media is Evelyn," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Evelyn took the trouble and used a foreign IP address to send the anonymous emails, an expert could easily check it out if they took the trouble to look it up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was still too naive.</p></div>
