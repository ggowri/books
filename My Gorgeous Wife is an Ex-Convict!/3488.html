        <h1>Chapter 3486</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper responded with a nod, watching as Mason quickly ran away into the distance. However, he felt a strong sense of worry rising in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, even if Mason is skilled, those kidnappers are several grown adults and they also have weapons in their hands!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, the only one who can save Veronica is Mason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyway, she needs to contact her father and the police as soon as possible. Only by involving more people can we ensure the safety of Mason and Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper kept running down the mountain with only one thought in his mind: "Save the person!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica ran desperately, knowing only that she had to run as fast as she could. Even if she was eventually caught, she had to buy Jasper some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This way, Jasper will have more people who can come to Valda's rescue!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she stumbled on a tree root and fell hard to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she was trying to get up, the kidnappers had already rushed towards her. One of them even lifted his foot and stomped hard on her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Run, why aren't you running?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt a sudden pain in her back, and now she feels completely weak and powerless, as if her body has given up on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why is she the only one here? Where is the other person?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Damn it!" With these words, Veronica was suddenly pulled up by someone. "Quickly, where did Jasper from the Reed family hide?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I don't know!" gasped Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, a slap fiercely landed on her face. "Don't you know? How could you not know? Speak up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her cheeks burned with pain, but Veronica remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Veronica remained stubborn, one of the men looked at her with malicious intent and said, "This girl looks good, no wonder Lao Wu couldn't resist. Since she won't talk, let's strip her naked and see if she changes her mind!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as this idea was proposed, it immediately received the approval of the others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's body trembled and her face turned pale. She knew that these people wanted to use this humiliating method to make her speak out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... she can't speak!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now at least Jasper still has a chance to escape safely. If we speak up, Jasper's chance of escape will decrease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These people looked at Veronica with her mouth tightly closed, becoming increasingly impatient. One of them started tearing Veronica's clothes directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She struggled hard, but it was completely useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she watched her clothes being continuously stripped off, her face grew even paler and her whole body trembled with extreme fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't... don't..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her struggles were completely useless. The other person even pressed her down onto the ground, which was rough and full of weeds, intending to do something inappropriate to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was already the second time she had faced such a situation in a short period of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The last time, she was able to use the necklace that Mason gave her to injure the other person and escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time, she didn't have a second necklace in her hand, and she was facing not just one kidnapper, but several young and strong men!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica almost closed her eyes in despair, ready to accept the cruel fate that was about to come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And at this moment, strangely enough, Mason's face flashed through her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why, at a time like this, was she not thinking of her father or Daniel, but of Mason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was he the person she missed the most in her heart, or was she hoping that Mason would come to save her?</p></div>
