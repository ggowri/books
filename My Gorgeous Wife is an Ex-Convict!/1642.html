        <h1>Chapter 1640</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mom, don't worry about the future. I'll find a boyfriend and introduce you to him when this is over," Lina said jokingly, not wanting her mother to worry too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her parents had already worried too much for her. If only her marriage could give her parents peace of mind, then... she would try her best to marry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace received a call from the kindergarten teacher saying that something had happened to her daughter and wanted her to come over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace instantly felt a thump in her heart. "What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Here's the thing... Jasper got into a fight with another child, and they... got a little injured..." the teacher said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace learned from the phone call that Jasper and Oriel Lynch had gotten into a fight in kindergarten. Oriel Lynch was slightly injured as Jasper had ripped a patch of her hair out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Girls valued their appearance. When Oriel Lynch saw a bald patch on her scalp, she instantly cried and insisted on pulling Jasper's hair too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As one was the adopted daughter of the Reed family while the other was the heiress of the Reed family who had just returned, the class teacher could not offend either side. Hence, they could only make this phone call with caution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace hurried to the kindergarten. However, before she could walk into the teachers&rsquo; office, she heard Irene Lynch's shouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you have any manners? How has your mother taught you? You and Oriel are sisters, after all. How could you pull Oriel's hair like that? Did you do it on purpose? You... You're so mean for your age..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"She's not my sister!" Jasper Reed's childlike voice replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What did you say? Oriel's your daddy's daughter. Why is she not your sister?" Irene Lynch's voice had gotten sharper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No! I only have a brother!" the little one retorted bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Did your mommy teach you to say that? How long have you been back? What will happen when you grow up if you're already shunning your sister?" scolded Irene Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What happens to my sister when she grows up is our family's business. It has nothing to do with you, Aunty Lynch." Mick Reed's childlike voice was cold. "Also, you slandered my mommy. You have to apologize to her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace happened to reach the office door and saw her son's tiny body in front of her daughter as he defended her and her daughter. Her heart could not help but melt at the sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick was a reliable child even though he was usually quiet! As long as he started becoming concerned about someone, he would treat them really well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Apologize? Mick, Oriel's your sister too. Don&rsquo;t you like Oriel? Why don&rsquo;t you treat Oriel as your sister anymore? Your mommy must have said something to you, right? Did she tell you to stop being nice to Oriel?" Irene Lynch spoke aggressively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch was also looking at Mick Reed with pitiful reddened eyes. "Mick, I... I'm your sister too. Why are you only helping her and not me?"</p></div>
