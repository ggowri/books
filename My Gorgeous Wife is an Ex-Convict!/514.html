        <h1>Chapter 513</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was more ruthless than passionate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did someone like him have anything important to him? As soon as the thought flashed through Grace's mind, she somehow remembered Brian's silver bracelet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because of the silver bracelet that she knew Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bracelet was obviously for children, but Brian treated it like it was a piece of treasure. What exactly was the story behind the bracelet?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who are you looking at?" A low and elegant voice suddenly rang in Grace's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately came to her senses, and when she turned around, her lips narrowly missed Jason's. Then, she realized that his face was so close to hers that she had almost kissed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's thin lips parted as he whispered, "No matter who you're looking at, the person in your heart can only be me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he looked past her to the figure standing at the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was a childhood friend. Jason did not expect that one day they would be interested in the same woman. The only difference was that now he had gotten Grace's heart, but Brian did not know that the person he had been looking for was actually Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, if he could, he would never let Brian know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason looked at Brian, Brian seemed to sense something. He shot his gaze to Jason&rsquo;s direction and they made eye contact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A moment later, Brian took Evelyn and walked slowly toward Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The moment he saw Grace, Brian was struck with awe. She looked different than before. Her black hair was plaited in a style that was both elegant and lively while her refined makeup made her look so attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Under the lights, her bright almond-shaped eyes seemed to glow with a gleam. They were bright, yet they seemed to have a certain fortitude. In a trance, he vaguely saw the little girl's eyes again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That same little girl had looked at him with the same look in her eyes before saying, "Don't be afraid, I'm here. I'll get you out of here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That little figure eventually did it. She led him step by step away from the dangerous place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he sprained his ankle, he thought she would escape without him, but she carried him on her back and insisted on taking him with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was given hope amid despair, and it was a feeling he would probably never forget.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian," Evelyn cried a little uneasily when she saw Brian looking at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had taken Evelyn by surprise today. She thought her outfit would be enough to make her the focus of the banquet today. After all, it was not cheap and was a lot better than many of the dresses on the socialites present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, looking at Grace's gown, Evelyn felt jealousy brewing within her. What made her even more uncomfortable was that the Grace today made her feel like she was seeing the same person she used to be&mdash;the radiant, promising female lawyer. On the other hand, she was just a small actress.</p></div>
