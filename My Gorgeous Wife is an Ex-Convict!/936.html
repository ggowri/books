        <h1>Chapter 935</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she praised a male celebrity, he would not look at her properly. In the end, she would have to coax him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she did not do so, he would tell her parents about her underground bar trip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she could only be subservient with her tail between her legs during this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, if she were to put aside Hadwin&rsquo;s jealousy, everything else was pretty good. For example, when she watched TV, he would automatically give her snacks. When she had a backache, he would give her a massage. When she wanted a celebrity's signature, he would get it for her. Of course, this was limited to female celebrities only.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the sweetness on her best friend's face, Grace hoped her best friend's relationship with Hadwin would be smooth sailing till the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... As she thought of Hadwin's family background and the Stephenson family, she could not help feeling worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The Stephenson family is complicated. Hadwin became the Stephenson family's patriarch with the identity of a b*stard. How dangerous would that be? Mrs. Stephenson and her two sons are still alive and well. Would they be willing to put Hadwin in charge of the large Stephenson Group?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or are they thinking of something else? After all, members of a rich and powerful family often fight each other for fortune to the death!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only hoped Lina could be happier than her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina deserved the best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina chatted with Grace for a while again before leaving Grace's rental house when it was getting late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The night in Emerald City in September was not as hot and stuffy as in the daytime. It was comfortable when the cool breeze blew on one&rsquo;s face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lina felt depressed as she thought of how Grace was entangled with Jason again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not do anything for Grace and could only watch her best friend get stuck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina drove to Hadwin's mansion in Emerald City instead of driving home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin had been spending most of his time in Emerald City now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she arrived, the servant hurried over to open the door. Hadwin was stunned when he saw Lina. "It's late, why are you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before he could finish, Lina had rushed forward and grabbed Hadwin's waist before burying her face in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her sudden embrace startled Hadwin. The girl had seemed on edge whenever she saw him lately. When had she ever taken the initiative to do such things?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you been drinking?" he asked. After all, she would grope him every time she got drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," she said, her head continuing to rub against his chest. 'Mhm, my man smells so good.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then what's going on with you? Which of your favorite celebrities have let you down?" He thought of a second reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." She continued to rub, her hands slowly reaching toward his waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was speechless. "Lina!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes!" She quickly withdrew her hands, lifted her head, and looked at him with her round eyes. "I came to see you because I wanted to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, he felt lost in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Come to think of it, I've seen many beautiful women, but only she can tantalize and seduce me this easily.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, Hadwin came to himself. He looked at the clock on the wall. "You want to see me at this hour?" It was already past 10 PM.</p></div>
