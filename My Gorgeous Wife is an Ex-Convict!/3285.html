        <h1>Chapter 3283</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was beaten today because those people were getting impatient. She would think of a way to get the money back!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Wilona glanced at her son and said, "After you recover from your injuries, try to get on Jasper's good side. You need to work hard to please her. As long as she's happy, all our problems will be solved! Maybe she'll even give you money if she's happy enough!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't want to please Jasper just for money," Lawrence said, biting his lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What did you say?" Wilona was angry. She was already upset from being beaten today, and now her son was defying her, making her even more furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't want to please Jasper just for money," Lawrence repeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona slapped him directly, and Lawrence's little face immediately swelled up on one side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want our whole family to accompany you to the grave? If you can't stay by Jasper's side properly, then we'll all be left out in the cold! Listen carefully, no matter what, you cannot let Jasper be dissatisfied with you, understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence felt a burning sensation on his cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, he also wants to win Jasper's favor, hoping that Jasper will like him more and that he can always stay by Jasper's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he doesn't want these things, he's only in it for the money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he is still young, he knows that money is very important, but... if he were to only please Jasper for the sake of money, he would feel like something would be destroyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other side, William was waiting in Jasper's room and handed him a gift, saying "This is a Christmas present. I won't be able to come on the day itself since I'll be in Deer Capital, so I'm giving it to you in advance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper opened the gift and saw a beautiful doll dressed in fancy clothes with hair accessories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she is still young, she has spent several years with the Reed family and has seen many valuable jewelry pieces with her parents. Therefore, she can recognize that the gems embedded in the dress and the diamonds on the hair accessories of this doll are all real.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This doll is very pretty, but it must be expensive," said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," said William. "Don't you like it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I like it, but... Mom said I can't accept very expensive gifts from others," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But... I'm not someone else, aren't we really good friends? Besides, I bought this gift with my own pocket money. I just thought it looked really nice, so I wanted to give it to you," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper thought for a moment after hearing this and seemed to find it somewhat reasonable. As a result, a happy smile appeared on his face again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William breathed a sigh of relief and felt happy seeing her smiling so happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, I have prepared your Christmas gift, so I'll give it to you in advance," Jasper said, walking over to a nearby glass cabinet. He opened the cabinet, revealing a row of neatly arranged boxes of various sizes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Each box has been packed and at the knot of the box's string, there is a paper tag hanging with the name of the recipient written on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper took out a box and handed it to William. "This is my gift for you, but it's not as valuable as yours."</p></div>
