        <h1>Chapter 1149</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending her conversation with her best friend, Grace looked at the online buzz, and sure enough, the video was trending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were many comments below. One person even named her the woman who took the crown prince on the bus!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know whether to laugh or cry when she saw some of the netizens' comments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such gossip would calm down after a few days!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not expect someone to come to her when she returned to her rental house, just to ask about the trending news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you dating Brian?" Patrick asked Grace as he rushed to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She had met the man in front of her before. He was a friend of Jason and a socialite in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it true?" asked Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's personal. I have no comments," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was having a headache. He was dumbfounded when he saw the trending news this morning. He had seen how much Jason cared about her before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's secretary, Terrence, told him Jason had already split with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason had been going to Tianxiang Pavilion every night. It was so unusual! He figured it was because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, Brian was involved with Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick dared not imagine what kind of reaction Jason would have when he saw the video!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Or... had he already seen it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he called Brian at noon, Brian had also replied with the words &lsquo;No comment&rsquo;, which made Patrick feel like fainting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that she was about to leave, Patrick stopped her again and said, "Grace, I just want you to give me an answer. Are you and Brian dating? If you are, I'll keep your video today on the trending list and make sure it'll trend for a month so that the whole country knows you're dating. If you're not, then take what I just said as nonsense!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was the one suffering a headache now. As Patrick looked like he would keep his word, Grace could only reply, "We're not dating."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the video trended for a month, the whole country would know her by then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Patrick's phone suddenly rang. After listening to it for a while, his brows suddenly furrowed. He looked at Grace, who was about to leave, and immediately ended the call. He strode to Grace's side. He grabbed her and said, "Come with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Before Grace could react, Patrick had stuffed Grace into the car. He started it and swiftly drove forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately asked, "Where are you taking me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll know when we're there," Patrick said with a grim face. He only hoped they could make it in time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager of Tianxiang Pavilion had called him and said that Jason was now in Tianxiang Pavilion, but... One of the guests went a little too far and offended Jason, then things became a little messy.</p></div>
