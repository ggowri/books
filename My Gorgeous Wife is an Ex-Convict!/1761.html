        <h1>Chapter 1759</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jason had shown up in front of her and the entrance of the house was crowded with people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why... Why are you here? Why is the image on the surveillance different?" Lily asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There are many things you can fake, like how you got yourself a fake identity and used a fake son to trick Sean. So why is it surprising that I&rsquo;m here?" Jason looked at Lily coldly. "We've also caught your two helpers. Lily, your game is over. I'll settle the old and new debts with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily's heart sank. Her two helpers were huge fans of her, and one of them was also a wanted criminal online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They had planned this with her. If those two had been arrested, then she...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Everything ends here!" Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's men immediately subdued Lily with little difficulty. They also handed Jason the remote control for the explosives and the phone Lily was using to talk to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason spoke into the phone, "Grace, can you hear me? I'm sending someone up the hill to pick you and Mason up. You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before he could finish, there was suddenly a loud boom from the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The sound did not only come from the phone. The noise came from the hill, and they could hear it inside the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason almost dropped the phone to the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, Grace!" He kept shouting, but there was no answer from the other end of the line. Before long, he heard the busy signal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hahaha... Jason, so what if you caught me? Grace is still going to die. Did you think the explosives could only be detonated with this remote control? No, those explosives were timed too. They&rsquo;ll explode regardless when the time is up!" Lily burst into laughter and said, "Even if I have to go to hell, I'll take Grace and your son with me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was waiting... to see the man suffer from the pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was waiting to see the look on the man's face when his men told him Grace was dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The man was expressionless when he learned of her sister's death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He did not even care about her sister's death back then. It was as if her death meant nothing to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her sister was his fianc&eacute;e then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">To Lily's surprise, Jason rushed out of the house to drive to the hill where the explosion took place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence immediately stopped Jason and said, "Young master Reed, it's too dangerous! We don't know how many explosives Lily planted in the mountain. If you rush over, what if..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll kill anyone who tries to stop me!" Jason said with scarlet eyes.</p></div>
