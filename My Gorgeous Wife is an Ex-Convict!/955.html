        <h1>Chapter 954</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to hit me without finding out the truth first?" Grace asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the point? I&rsquo;ve caught you red-handed! You have no shame. He's got me already, yet you're in a hurry to hook up with him. What dirty tricks have you used to seduce him?" You Keer said bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not interested in your boyfriend!" Grace said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row was having an intense headache. He was already frustrated enough, yet You Keer came meddling in this. He was extremely regretful that he had found a girlfriend like her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I shouldn't have looked past You Keer's appearance!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough!" Curtis Row pulled You Keer over. "Have you had enough? Apologize to Miss Cummins now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Apologize? You're asking me to apologize? You want me to apologize to such a shameless person? How many times have you slept with her? Were you impressed by her skills in bed?&rdquo; You Keer was harsh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, she would not get into fights with others so often!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row panicked! 'Sleep with her? How could I sleep with Grace? If there&rsquo;s such a thing, Jason and Brian would have killed me by now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shut up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Never! This woman may look dignified, but she has the cheek to do such a shameful thing. Fine, I'm going to expose her and show others her true color!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">You Keer pulled out her phone as she spoke. She planned to use it to film Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row was about to faint. 'Does she have a death wish? If You Keer films Grace and posts it on the internet, then I can forget about staying in Emerald City!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you crazy?" Curtis Row grabbed You Keer's phone and slapped her in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">You Keer was a little stunned by the slap. It took her a moment to come to her senses. "Did... Did you just hit me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you even know what you're doing?" snarled Curtis Row.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why wouldn't I know? I'm confronting a homewrecker! You're defending her, aren't you?" You Keer lunged toward Curtis Row.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man and woman fought each other in such a way that it was almost a farce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The colleagues watching the scene were dumbfounded, and so was Andrea Schwartz. 'This is... a little different than what I expected. Shouldn't You Keer continue fighting with Grace? Shouldn't she be embarrassing Grace instead?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace is probably just a breath of fresh air to Curtis Row. You Keer is much better than Grace, regardless of figure and looks! Why is Curtis Row defending Grace instead of You Keer?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz only felt that the current situation could not be explained with common sense!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row and You Keer tussled for a while, but the result was a tie. On the one hand, Curtis Row had feelings for You Keer and could not bear to be heavy-handed. On the other hand, You Keer tore, bit, pulled, and tugged... She used everything and behaved like a shrew, yet Curtis Row only managed to fend her off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked like an outsider instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The ruckus drew some of the senior lawyers out of their respective offices, and they all frowned at the sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter had also left his office. He was about to ask about what was going on when, out of the corner of his eye, he saw a figure walking into the office. He was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No way. How could he be here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, You Keer suddenly broke away from Curtis Row and was about to hit Grace who had turned around to walk toward Lawyer Carter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter quickly shouted to Grace, "Watch out!"</p></div>
