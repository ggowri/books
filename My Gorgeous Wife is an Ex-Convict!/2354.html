        <h1>Chapter 2352</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes grew darker. Moments later, a mocking laugh rose from his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought about the unborn baby and her friend Amber Mitchell even in her dreams. What place did Martin Weiss occupy in her heart, then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He probably meant nothing to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he mattered to her, she would not have chosen to separate from him so ruthlessly. She did not even give him a chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was funny that he had forgotten his feelings for her, but he still seemed to be under her influence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, if you have the slightest affection for me, then I&hellip;" he muttered before turning away to walk out of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Staying in this ward and listening to her call out to other people would only make him more aware of how big of a failure he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, right as he opened the ward door, her voice flooded into his ears again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin... I'm sorry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly came to a halt, turned his head, and looked blankly at Kyla, who was still asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she... apologizing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she apologizing to me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Is she dreaming about... me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'So, does that mean she still has feelings for me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pressed his thin lips together and hesitated slightly before finally letting out a slight sigh. He closed the ward door again and went to the bedside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He ran his fingers gently across her lips. "Do you feel sorry for me? Have you thought about what you can do to make it up to me, then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was still sound asleep, and what answered him was the silence of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had a long dream. She dreamt of her unborn baby and was left in fear as something tried to snatch her baby from her. She did everything she could to keep her baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she dreamed of Amber Mitchell. Amber Mitchell was wounded all over and wailing in pain. She tried to get close to her but was stopped by one dark shadow after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, she dreamed of Martin Weiss and everything that had happened in the past. Finally, Martin Weiss looked at her expressionlessly and said, &lsquo;Kyla, do you regret it? I'll forgive you if you apologize.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not regret it, but she wanted him to forgive her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want him to resent and hate her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla slowly opened her eyes, what she saw was the darkness outside the window, the light in the room, and Martin Weiss... who was sitting on the couch by the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla could not tell whether it was a dream or reality for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss got up, walked over to her, and said, "You're awake." She immediately came back to her senses. "What... What are you doing here?"</p></div>
