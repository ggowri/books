        <h1>Chapter 2800</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she began stammering as she went on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, it was enough to shock Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not expect her to answer so directly. He had only been mildly interested in seeing what she would say. Now, he was the stunned one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yeah, the woman liked him, so she wanted to kiss him. Her eyes were clear and pure as if telling him plainly that she only liked him and did not have any other agenda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to kiss me again, then... alright," he replied to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was stunned as she blinked stupidly. It was as if she was in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You don't want to?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" she answered almost subconsciously. Moments later, as if she had come to her senses, she blushed and said, "Well... Can I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why not?" He smiled. The usual indifference in his eyes seemed to have melted away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller nervously licked her dry lips. 'He agreed. Does this mean he has some feelings for me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'At the very least, he's not against kissing me. Will he slowly fall for me, then?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller put down her pencil and held Brian's face in her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hands were warm, and her face looked nervous and earnest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian only thought Valda Theller looked adorable. Many women wanted to kiss him, but it was the first time a woman showed such an expression when she tried to kiss him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... inexperienced. I hope you... uh... don't mind if I don&rsquo;t do so well," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Laughter flickered in those phoenix eyes. "It's okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took another deep breath before carefully walking up to kiss Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips were just as soft as she remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they were also as cool as she remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to warm his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller kissed him and seemed to forget the time. She finally stopped the kiss when his cold lips finally had some warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what she saw when she opened her eyes were his deep phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She instantly froze as she blushed again. "Did... Did I kiss you for too long just now? Well... I'm sorry, I... I'll pay attention to the time next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He chuckled. She seemed to be able to make him laugh easily. "Are you hoping to do it again next time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller blushed harder. "No... That... That's not what I meant... Uh... No, I... I wish I could do it again. Well... Well..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She became more flustered as she spoke. She was even stammering hard.</p></div>
