        <h1>Chapter 881</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When his phoenix eyes saw the dress in Stella&rsquo;s hands, his expression immediately changed. "What are you doing with the dress? Put it down!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice was so cold that Stella was startled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Weren&rsquo;t&hellip; Weren&rsquo;t you going to give me this dress?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she said this, Brian's expression changed again. 'Yes, but no.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had planned to give it to the little girl who saved him when he found her because he once promised her that he would give her a purple dress with tiny flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he was unable to link Stella with the girl from his childhood when he finally found her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person he yearned for felt so unfamiliar when she appeared in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want a dress, I'll give you another one later," he said as he took the dress back from her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella's expression immediately froze, but then she said with feigned nonchalance, "Alright. Thank you, Brian. By the way, I took some money out of the card you gave me today. It doesn't matter, does it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since I gave it to you, you can use it whenever you want," Brian said lightly</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't use it. I planned to give the money to Grace since she has broken up with Jason, so she might not be doing as well financially. However..." Stella bit her lip as if she was wronged. "These tens of thousands of dollars are probably nothing to her. She won't accept it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Brian stared at Stella, making her feel guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I think so. What kind of life did Grace lead when she was with Jason? Besides, she once suffered in prison. It&rsquo;s natural even if she&rsquo;s a little vain now. I just don't know if she would deliberately find excuses to get close to rich men to live a better life. I'm really afraid she'll be cheated!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella continued to make these slanderous remarks. She intended to make Brian think that Grace was a vain woman. Therefore, if Grace did tell Brian something, she could make Brian think that Grace made up a lie to get close to him after breaking up with Jason as she did not want to live a hard life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was Stella's plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She did not want Brian to believe Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, as she spoke, she realized that Brian was not even listening. His phoenix eyes were now looking at the purple dress he had just taken back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'The purple dress... Brian probably prepared this dress for Grace!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella's eyes flashed with envy! 'It feels as if Grace would snatch Brian away at any moment. Even if... Grace doesn&rsquo;t tell him the truth, Brian may accept Grace anyway!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'No, I must not let this happen!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the weekend, Lina came looking for Grace. "Are you free today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I guess so," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, what about going somewhere to relax? I'll take you to a nice place later," Lina said mysteriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A nice place?" Grace raised her eyebrows. "Don't you have to accompany Hadwin today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We&rsquo;re going to a nice place. Hadwin doesn't fit in there," said Lina.</p></div>
