        <h1>Chapter 843</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove to the hospital entrance, and Jason carried Grace all the way into the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was treated by the same doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After examining her knee, the doctor said, "It's probably because you&rsquo;ve suddenly stopped taking your medicine, so it&rsquo;s now causing you physical discomfort. Also, you&rsquo;ve caught a cold, which is causing your knee to ache from time to time. Treatment for joint problems like this is long-term. If you stop taking the medication, sometimes it'll make things worse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Give her a prescription. I'll have her come in every week," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I don't need any long-term treatment. Just give me something to relieve the pain," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor looked at Jason as he was put in an awkward predicament.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do as I say," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the doctor prescribed the medicine and sent his assistant to fetch it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just when Jason was asking the gynecologist, the same one who previously treated Grace's uterine problems, to see her, Grace suddenly said, "There's no need for that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason frowned slightly and was about to say something when Grace suddenly smiled. "I was treating it in hopes to get pregnant and have a child. Since I'm no longer planning to get pregnant and have a child, is there any need to treat it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together. After a moment, he raised his hand and asked the gynecologist to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sat down on a couch in the VIP room and started rubbing her hands against her knees again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was still experiencing some pain in her knees. According to her experience, a pain like this would go on for two to three hours if it was going to last a short while and seven to eight hours if longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Jason suddenly squatted down in front of Grace. Then, he placed his hands on her knees and began to massage them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was instantly stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His beautiful long fingers were massaging her knees through her long dress as he exerted just the right amount of pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her knees were feeling hotter and hotter as if they were going to burn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you feel better?" His voice had always been melodious, and that cold tone sounded particularly clear in the quiet room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at the face close at hand. He was squatting, so their line of sight was almost at the same level. His bright eyes seemed to be filled with worry for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But how could he possibly worry about me? At best, he&rsquo;s probably just feeling a little bit of residual sympathy after our breakup....'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll do it myself," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raising his eyebrows, he said, "What's the matter? You don't like me massaging your knees for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We broke up," she said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's hands stopped what they were doing. 'Is she so eager to get away from me after saying that she&rsquo;s going to forget me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He then suddenly recalled her drunken kiss at Drunken Days' entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That silly smile of hers and the way she said, "Jason, I'm going to forget about you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What she said and did are normal reactions to a breakup, but why do I feel so uncomfortable?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since we&rsquo;ve broken up, why did you hold me and kiss me that day?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned as she did not expect Jason to ask that question.</p></div>
