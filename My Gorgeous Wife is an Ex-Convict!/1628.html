        <h1>Chapter 1626</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, when he walked out of the bathroom, he saw Katherine Jackson sitting on the couch with a meaningful smile on her lips. "It seems you still can't get over your sweetheart. You saved her today, but it's a pity you can't be with her no matter how reluctant you are."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I just happened to be passing by and helped her out. Now that I've decided to marry you, don't worry about it," Hadwin Stephenson said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That would be best." Katherine Jackson got up and walked over to Hadwin Stephenson. "You should know how much I've done for you. I helped you regain control of the Stephenson family and persuaded my parents to let you keep your position as president after we marry and merge our companies. Lina can never do what I've done for you. She can never have your back or help you with anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was the only one who could help him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson put her arm around Hadwin Stephenson's neck as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's body stiffened slightly, and his eyes glimmered a little. However, he did not push her away this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Satisfaction flashed through Katherine Jackson's eyes. 'I'll eventually conquer him...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin, only I can help you. I can get you to the top, fight with you, and won't let others look down on you. Lina will only get in your way," Katherine Jackson said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Lina, Lina... Can she wait for me a little longer? If only she&rsquo;ll give me some time, just a little more time...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace and Jason went back to Reed Residence and cleaned up the filth all over their bodies. Grace also thoroughly checked Jason's body to make sure there was nothing wrong with him before feeling relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't defend me so recklessly next time. Fortunately, what they threw today were only eggs, vegetables, and joss paper. If they had thrown sulfuric acid, the consequences would be unimaginable," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She still shuddered at the thought of what had just happened. Especially when he desperately protected her in his arms to prevent those things from hitting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had felt helpless at the time. He was protecting her, but she could not do anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not a good feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "Even so, it&rsquo;s better for those things to hit me than you. Grace, I'm your husband, and it's natural for a husband to protect his wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You and the kids are the only people I'll protect, so no buts. If one day you can protect me, will you stand by and do nothing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace paused. She knew she would not stand by and not do anything. She would protect him with her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's with that man today? Does he have a legal dispute with you?" Jason asked, digressing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He was the defendant in one of the lawsuits I handled. He was charged for assault, and his lawyer was my mentor," she said.</p></div>
