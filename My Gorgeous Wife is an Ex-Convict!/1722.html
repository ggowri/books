        <h1>Chapter 1720</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But coming home later... Relax?' Jason's mind flashed back to when Lina took Grace to watch a &lsquo;performance&rsquo; in the underground club.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Did they go to one of those places again&hellip; to relax? Is that why Grace is coming home late?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, Lina had a bad record.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason thought about it and took out his phone to dial Grace's number. Before long, Grace answered the call. Apart from Grace&rsquo;s voice, there was also a commotion at the other end of the line. They seemed to be in a bustling place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, I can't go home yet. It's probably going to take a while. I'll call you when I&rsquo;m going home," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Where are you right now?" Jason asked grimly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before she could tell him where she was, Lina's voice came from the phone. "Grace, hang up. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of money to hire these handsome men. Which one do you think... Hiccup... Which one&rsquo;s the most handsome..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was speechless. 'Jay heard everything Lina said! God knows if Jay has gotten the wrong idea.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, it's not what you think. Lina and I are just&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason interrupted and said, "What am I thinking? Tell me where you are at once!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was speechless. Though she could not see his expression, his voice sounded a little... angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, Grace had to obediently tell Jason where she was and shared with him her live location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll pick you up later." Jason ended the call after saying that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace put away her phone and took another look at Lina, who was drinking with several of the nightclub's male escorts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina had called and asked if she could keep her company today, so she said yes right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, the two met up and had dinner. She learned from Lina that after the matter regarding Lina being a homewrecker subsided, she unexpectedly had a few encounters with Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, why do you think it's so hard to get over someone?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace thought of how Lina had ordered wine during dinner earlier. As she drank, she spoke with agony. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What she could only say was, "Lina, since you can't get over him, why not give Hadwin Stephenson and yourself another chance? Both of you are single. It's not necessarily impossible for you two to get back together." She did not want to see her best friend in agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I&rsquo;ve thought of it too, but... the thought of getting back together with him makes me scared and worried. I'm scared of being dumped again. Grace, would you dare to get back together with someone who once dumped you?" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was silent. She understood the feeling of being dumped. It was just like how Sean had dumped her back then. Even if she never met Jay, she would probably disagree if Sean asked her to get back together with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace and Lina were supposed to go shopping after dinner. However, when passing by the nightclub, Lina suddenly thought of going in to have a look. She even said, "I heard there are a lot of handsome men here. I don't believe that I can't get over Hadwin Stephenson after seeing so many attractive men!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace knew her best friend was a little drunk but did not stop her. After all, it would be good for her best friend to vent out some of her frustrations.</p></div>
