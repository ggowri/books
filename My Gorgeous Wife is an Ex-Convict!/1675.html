        <h1>Chapter 1673</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then you can make him pay whatever price you want!" said Jason. He would do anything for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace froze. The man in front of her seemed to spoil her a lot. It was as though he would give her whatever she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It seems you'll agree with everything I do. Aren't you afraid I'll do something bloody and violent? What if I want to kill the man?" quipped Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll do it for you if you really want that to happen," he said earnestly. He could spill blood for her if that was what she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No!" she quickly said as she looked back at him sternly. "I'm just kidding, Jay. I don't want you to do these bad things for me. Don't ever do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His lashes quivered a little as his dark eyes glistened with a soft light. "Sure," he answered in a soft voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was in a good mood. After all, due to Damian Harmon's lawsuit, the gossip about Grace and her mentor had been trending these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although the Reed family had taken the news off the trending list, Damian Harmon continued to stay active online. He had a bunch of keyboard warriors supporting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Today, Damian Harmon posted another sadfishing post to win the netizen&rsquo;s sympathy, stating how hard his life had been after the case. He also implied that Grace had colluded with her mentor so that Old Lawker Kang would deliberately lose the case to have his apprentice gain some fame.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch saw the post two hours ago. He had just posted it and there were not many comments below.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She waited two more hours to see what the netizens were commenting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She would feel better seeing those comments criticizing Grace! Then, she just had to find a way to build the momentum. Even if Damian Harmon lost the lawsuit in the end, Grace's reputation would be damaged and a grudge would be planted in her and Jason's hearts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As long as she made good use of this opportunity, she would be the final winner!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch turned on her phone with a smile on her lips and looked at the post, only to freeze when she read the comments. They were not what she had expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Water Faucet: [With a husband like Jason, who would want an old man? Do you think there's something wrong with Grace's eyes?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Spring And Autumn Stage: [Lawyers have analyzed the case. Only an idiot would think there's something wrong with the case. You know full well what you've done. It's only a matter of course that you lost the case!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A Tub Of Rice Official: [You're the one who tricked Old Lawyer Watts. If the evidence hadn't proved you guilty, would he have lost the case? You should go to his house to kowtow and apologize!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">King Of The World: [Damn, you're amazing. You alone have caused public outrage in the legal world. They're probably going to blacklist the name &lsquo;Damian Harmon&rsquo;!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch looked confused. 'What happened? Why did the course of events change all of a sudden? It wasn&rsquo;t like this before. Public outrage in the legal world? What's going on?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch quickly looked through the news portal again. After 15 minutes, she finally understood what was going on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">L City's bar association was siding with Grace and her mentor. Moreover, many well-known lawyers of the association had analyzed the case with reasonable grounds and finally reached a unanimous conclusion that her mentor did not deliberately lose the case. It was because of the solid evidence that the defendant was declared guilty!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even the judge who presided over the case posted a statement online, saying he had made his decision based on the evidence and that he had a clear conscience.</p></div>
