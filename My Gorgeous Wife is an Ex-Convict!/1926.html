        <h1>Chapter 1924</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The Reed family deliberately kept the two little ones from finding out about the accident. They also brought the children back to the mansion and asked Mick Reed, Jasper Reed, and William to stay there for a few days. They said the kindergarten had to close for renovation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even if the kindergarten did not need any renovation, the Reed family had ways to make them renovate their premises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Mick Reed got past the firewall that the mansion had set up to stop them from accessing certain news. He found out about the explosion and his parents were now in hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed could not accept it anymore and insisted on going to the hospital to visit his parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper also insisted like Mick Reed after finding out about it. She had already packed her backpack, wanting to go to the hospital to take care of her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two little ones gave Uncle Kwan a big headache. Eventually, he asked Jason if he could bring the two little bosses to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason looked at Grace, asking for her opinion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let them come, or they&rsquo;ll keep making a fuss," said Grace, who was now able to hold a conversation by speaking instead of typing on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she could not talk for too long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After ending the call, Grace looked at Jason and said, "I don't want the kids to see us like this and get scared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"They should be aware of the dangers outside. Even if they&rsquo;re the heirs of the Reed family, it&rsquo;s impossible to avoid all potential harm," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Aren't you afraid the kids will cry?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Isn't it normal for children to cry and make a fuss? There's nothing to be afraid of," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when the two little ones were in front of them, Grace saw how Jason&rsquo;s words came back to bite him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As soon as Jasper saw that her parents were injured, especially at the sight of her father still on a drip, she sobbed until she was out of breath. She constantly shed tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason, who was calm at first, was at a loss when he saw his daughter in tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The head of Reed group had always been calm in the face of big decisions. Now, facing his daughter's tears, he had no idea how to stop them. All he could do was wipe his daughter's tears away while saying that these injuries were nothing and he would be okay soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Their daughter looked so much like Grace. Looking at the little one's face that was full of tears, Jason felt his heart twist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason was finally relieved when the little one stopped crying. Then, he looked at Mick Reed, who was now in Grace's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed was never this affectionate. Before Grace came back, Jason rarely saw his son being affectionate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he did not think there was anything wrong with it before. After all, he was a boy and would also be the heir of the Reed family. Being affectionate was useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, after Grace returned to Emerald City, Jason found that his son would sometimes act affectionately. He was only like that with Grace, though.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For example, he would give the occasional hugs and kisses or pester Grace for a story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In Jason's opinion, his son's affectionate acts seemed awkward, especially since his son had a face similar to his own.</p></div>
