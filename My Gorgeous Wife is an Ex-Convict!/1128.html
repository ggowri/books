        <h1>Chapter 1127</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, some of the people around who heard what Wu Mincui had just said were now looking at them in some sort of way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone even asked, "You've... been to prison? But how can you be a paralegal... if you've been to prison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were naturally referring to Grace! Wu Mincui looked at Grace with jealousy. 'How could this woman still be a paralegal after getting out of prison?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, she was not doing so well outside compared to her time in prison. In prison, at least she was able to show off in front of the other inmates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was used to the strange stares around her and did not bother explaining anything, but Stella unexpectedly helped her out by saying, "It's just a couple of years in prison. It's nothing." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Stella looked at Grace with feigned kindness and said, "Grace, we're cousins. I don't care if you've been to prison. If you have any difficulties, you can tell me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A glint flashed across Grace&rsquo;s eyes. Was her cousin trying to show others her sisterly affections again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, some of the people who usually flattered Stella said, "Oh, Stella, you're so caring."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Although being caring is a good thing, you still have to be careful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's right. You must be careful. Some people will come out of prison a different person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, another actress who disliked Stella suddenly said, "Hey, she has a relative who has been to prison. I wonder if the crown prince would mind? the Hart family is a distinguished family, after all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Another person immediately said, "What are you talking about? It's only Stella's cousin who has been to prison. What does it have to do with Stella?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's right. Besides, Young Master Hart is so nice to Stella that he doesn't care if Stella's cousin has been to prison or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, people started commenting on Grace about her imprisonment, treating Grace like air. They completely made her fodder for conversation. No one cared about her feelings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at everything in front of her coldly. Feigning kindness, Stella said, "Grace, please go to the lounge and wait for me for a while. I'll get back to you after I&rsquo;m done with my makeup and tell you some ideas on the follow-up of the case."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips together at that. However, she chose to head to the lounge to wait for Stella anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, work was work, even though she did not want to linger any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she reached the lounge, Grace sat down. The room was empty at the moment. Grace sat down on the couch and waited for Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not long before she heard a man's gasps in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. Before she could think it over, a figure suddenly popped out from behind a curtain in the lounge where people could change their clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a closer look. It was Robert Brewer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's ex-husband!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Robert Brewer seemed a little unusual. His face was red, and he was wearing only a pair of boxers. There was something ferocious and impatient about his countenance. His eyes seemed like he had lost his mind. They did not have the clarity of a normal person!</p></div>
