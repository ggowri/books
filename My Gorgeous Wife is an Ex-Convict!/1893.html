        <h1>Chapter 1891</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">15 minutes later, Grace squatted at the gate and ate the breakfast the security guard brought&mdash;flower rolls, porridge, and some side dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was the breakfast served in the mansion today, and the security guard got another set for her. The security guard said it had taken him a lot of effort to get the food from the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Madam, go home. Young master Reed must already know that you&rsquo;ve been standing here all night but he hasn&rsquo;t asked us to let you in. Aren't you just suffering by standing here? Why don't you go back first? You'll see Young master Reed when he wants to see you," the security guard advised kindly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">While eating her breakfast, Grace shook her head and said, "No thanks. I'll continue standing here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had a feeling that if she gave up and went home, perhaps it would be harder for her to see him then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, what she needed to do now was to preserve her strength and not let herself collapse. If she still could not see him today, maybe she would ask Uncle Kwan to have someone send her a tent. She would just set up a tent outside the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The security guard had a headache when he heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Rumor had it that Young master Reed doted on Young Madam the most. Although she went missing for five years and suddenly returned with a daughter, Young master Reed still treasured Young Madam. There was even a video of Young master Reed shielding Young Madam from vegetable leaves and rotten eggs with his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, for some reason, Young master Reed was turning Young Madam away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does this mean... Young Madam is falling out of favor? But last night, the phone call from Terrence did not sound like she's about to lose favor.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The security guard had another headache at the thought of Terrence's phone call last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Remember, make sure nothing happens to Young Madam. Pull yourself together and treat her well. Give her whatever she wants, but... don't give Young Madam the impression she's getting any special treatment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But that's so hard to do!' the security guard complained to himself, only hoping Grace would go home soon so that it would be easier for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As she ate, Grace simply chatted with the security guard, casually asking about the weather these days, then some information about the old mansion. Finally, she asked who had come in and out of the manor these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The security guard answered her questions respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just as Grace asked if Jason had left the old mansion these days, the mansion gates suddenly opened and Jason appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace just stared blankly at Jason, not even swallowing her flower roll.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had been at the gate all night. She had even prepared herself for a long fight, planning to stay here for an eternity to do whatever it took to see him, but now... he had shown up in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'That's quick!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason glanced indifferently at Grace's half-eaten flower roll that her chopsticks were holding before looking at her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her cheeks were bulging, looking a little like a hamster. The dark circles under her eyes and the exhaustion between her brows more or less showed that she had been outside all night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was silence all around, and now it seemed as if there was only the sound of their breaths. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"J-Jay, why did you come out?" Grace's words were slightly slurred because she still had the flower roll in her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then it seems I shouldn't have come out," Jason said coldly and then turned to go back in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No!" Grace quickly said as she reached out to grab Jason's wrist. She also tried to swallow the flower roll in her mouth, but she swallowed too fast that she choked and coughed.</p></div>
