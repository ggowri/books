        <h1>Chapter 2231</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">" Tina is the heir of the Stephenson family, after all. Many people have their eyes set on Tina as they want to marry into the Stephenson family,&rdquo; Hadwin Stephenson said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said, "Are you really going to let Tina inherit the Stephenson family? What if Tina is bad at doing business? Aren't you afraid she'll bring down the Stephenson family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When I pass her the Stephenson family, she can do whatever she wants with it. It's up to her if she wants to bring the Stephenson family to a higher level or destroy it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was surprised. Her husband spoke as if he was only giving their daughter a toy, not a huge company worth tens of billions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about I give birth to a few more children? We&rsquo;ll see which one of them is suitable to inherit the Stephenson family," Lina asked thoughtfully. After all, one could not put all of one&rsquo;s eggs in one basket. It was good to have more options.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Hadwin Stephenson's expression changed as soon as she said that. "No!" The word escaped his mouth quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked at him in surprise, only finding his reaction a little aggressive. "Why not? Didn't you think it was a good idea to have more children?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson pressed his thin lips together tightly. Then, he raised his hands and pulled Lina into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them were standing in the middle of the banquet hall, and their embrace instantly attracted many people's attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, there are people around us..." Lina whispered to remind him. However, halfway through her sentence, she suddenly stopped speaking because she could feel Hadwin Stephenson's arms trembling as he held her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's... trembling!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina quickly said, "Hadwin, what&rsquo;s come over you? Are you feeling unwell? If you're feeling unwell, then... Then we'll find an excuse to leave. I'll bring you to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could ask Grace and Jason to host the full moon party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson muttered, "I'm okay. I'm just... scared. Lina, Tina's enough. Let's not have any more kids, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina paused. She knew what he was afraid of. He thought he was prepared for everything, but her water broke sooner than expected. She had a narrow escape during labor and was even in a coma for several days after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... that was because I was injected with poison. It's not like someone will hurt me every time I give birth. If we&rsquo;re a little more careful next time..." she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "But I'm not taking any chances. I'm happy with Tina alone. Really. She's the best gift God could give us. One child is enough. Really! Lina, I don't want to go through that fear again. I was so scared when I saw you lying in the hospital bed with your eyes closed. You showed no reaction aside from breathing..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would still be awakened by the despair he felt back then after dreaming of it at night. Then, he would stare at her for a long time before coming to his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina instantly felt her nose turn a little sore. He had never told her these. She thought everything was over after she woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it turned out he was still afraid.</p></div>
