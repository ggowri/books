        <h1>Chapter 885</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Hadwin spotted Lina who had climbed onto the table and was frantically waving her hand to the five men on the stage. Her hand... Um&hellip; Seemed to be swinging a vest. It looked like a man's stage costume!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace seems better than Lina.' Hadwin concluded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was actually not any better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was now standing on a chair, waving both her hands and occasionally cupping them around her mouth as she shouted to the five topless men who were dancing vigorously. "Go on! Go on! I'm with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was rendered speechless. Grace was a little different from how he remembered her to be!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin looked at Jason's expression. The light in the bar was dim, so it was hard to see how dark Jason's face was at the moment. However, judging from that expression... Hadwin sympathized with Grace a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had no idea how Grace would end things with a man like Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had broken up, but judging from the way Jason looked right now, it seemed that... something else was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stepped forward, reached out, and carried Grace into his arms from the chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To his surprise, instead of struggling, she put her arms around his neck and said with a smile, "Jay..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her calling him Jay made Jason tremble immediately. Now that she was smiling, she looked drastically different from after they broke up when she would keep him away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, his gaze met her tipsy almond-shaped eyes before glancing at the empty beer cans laying on the table. He immediately knew that she had been drinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only when she was drunk would she smile and call him Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing here... Are you here to see them dance too... They dance very well! Just looking at them... Hehe&hellip; Makes me excited! However... I didn't get their clothes. Lina had better luck... She got it!" she stammered, seemingly sounding somewhat reluctant at the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pursing his thin lips tightly, Jason carried Grace and decided to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina, who was still waving a vest on the table, shouted, "Hey... Where... Where are you taking Grace? We're not done here. They&hellip; They're going to take off more clothes later..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. I wanna watch&hellip; I wanna watch!" Grace joined in. "Jay... Let's watch together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face darkened as he cast a cold glance at Lina. 'If she's not Grace's best friend, I'd have surely made sure this woman regrets being alive! How dare she bring Grace to watch such nonsense?!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin quickly carried Lina down from the table and said to Jason, "Master Reed, Lina probably brought Grace here&hellip; out of kindness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kindness? What sort of kindness is it to bring her to watch such a show?" Jason snorted coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Although... their performance is a bit over the top, they have some musical talents," Hadwin said reluctantly. 'God knows how much I want to dismember the men on the stage, but now I have to clean up Lina's mess so Jason wouldn't bear a grudge against her.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin felt so aggrieved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always been the one to make others feel aggrieved, but ever since falling in love with Lina, he kept feeling aggrieved because of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Keep her under control, or I may do something to her one day!" Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do something to her?" Hadwin held the struggling person in his arms and sneered at Jason, "Master Reed, believe it or not, if you lay a hand on Lina, I'll take you on with the whole Stephenson family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men looked at each other again.</p></div>
