        <h1>Chapter 1405</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The doctor's voice sounded, and after the doctor explained the purpose of the call, the voice Martin Weiss was familiar with finally rang out. 'That's... Paisley Daniels's voice!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, what Paisley Daniels said was, "Sorry, I don't want to donate my bone marrow. I just registered my name in the bone marrow bank for fun."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But a young man is waiting for you to save his life. You&rsquo;d only have to rest for some time before recovering after donating your bone marrow. There won't be much damage..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The doctor tried hard to persuade her by saying all sorts of things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Paisley Daniels, who was on the phone, still refused. "I don't want to donate my bone marrow. What does it have to do with me whether he dies or not? Do I have to donate my bone marrow just because it matches him? You're ridiculous, and who's gonna be responsible if something happens to me after I donate my bone marrow? You? Or that poor half-dead creature waiting for the bone marrow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Every word Paisley Daniels said made Martin Weiss's face darker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It turned out that his death was nothing to Paisley Daniels, and she even saw him... as just a poor creature waiting to be saved by her bone marrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Daniels, are you sure you won't reconsider it? After all, the man is still so young. He has a lot waiting&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm warning you, stop calling to harass me or I'll sue your bone marrow bank for guilt-tripping!" Paisley Daniels's voice was impatient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, the call ended and a beeping sound came from the audio recording.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes stared darkly at the laptop screen before him. He suddenly began to laugh. Paisley had said Grace probably got someone to impersonate her voice even if there was a recording of the phone call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... was the voice really fake?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had been with Paisley for years. How could he not recognize her voice? The habit of her raising her tone at the end of her speech sometimes was clearly reflected in the audio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The audio seemed to have shattered the image of Paisley Daniels in his eyes that he had built up over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps the Paisley Daniels in the audio was the real her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The &lsquo;Paisley Daniels&rsquo; he thought he knew was nothing more than a figment of his imagination, embellished by his subconsciousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps, ever since he thought she was the one who donated him the bone marrow and saved his life, he began seeing her through rose-colored lenses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now, he finally saw the reality of it for what it was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes fell on another audio recording on the screen. His fingers trembled again. After a while, he finally clicked on the audio file.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Kyla Corbyn's voice sounded, his body instantly stiffened and his breathing seemed to have stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really? I&rsquo;m a match for that person? What a coincidence. But maybe this is fate as well. With so many people in the world, they happen to have a unique blood type and my bone marrow can help them. Of course, I'm willing to save them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That voice that was as melodious as a silver bell stated her agreement readily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You will? Really?" The doctor who called was stunned by her readiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, why else would I register with the bone marrow bank? I made up my mind when I registered."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's great! I thank you on behalf of the patient! But since it's a bone marrow donation, you also need to do a series of preparations in advance. You'll need injections, and you may experience some pain and discomfort when we extract the bone marrow..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm aware of that. I've read up on the relevant information when I registered. It'll be fine. I can endure the pain! If it doesn't work out the first time, I can donate a second or a third time just so I can save the patient."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The melodious voice was full of sincerity and kindness.</p></div>
