        <h1>Chapter 2073</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Chase Harper started sweating from working, Kyla handed over a tissue. "Wipe off your sweat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you." Chase Harper took the tissue, wiped off his sweat, and removed his coat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla took the coat. "I should be the one thanking you, or I would have had to find a repairman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You'll need to pay the repairman a door-to-door service fee of 100 dollars. Why spend that money? Just let me know if you ever need anything fixed. I'll fix it if I can, and you can save some money," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's too much trouble," Kyla said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper said, "We've been friends for years. It's no trouble. Besides, Juliet likes Nelson. I'm afraid I'll have to bring Juliet over and disturb you often."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "Juliet's adorable. My family likes her very much. If you're busy with your shop, you can leave Juliet with me. I can help you look after her. Juliet's very cute. I'll just think of it as having another daughter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had once wished that she could have an adorable daughter too, but now, she could never have one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper looked blankly at Kyla when he heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As if realizing something, Kyla said somewhat awkwardly, "I'm sorry. I don't mean anything else. I just find Juliet cute. After all, I don't have a daughter. So when I look at Juliet, I think..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla found that the more she explained, the more complicated it became. In the end, she could only say, "Anyway, I really... wasn't implying anything, so don't overthink it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper smiled and resolved her embarrassment. "I know you only think of me as a friend, and I won't overthink it. But it's difficult for you to take care of a child alone. If there's anything I can do to help, just let me know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper had an honest smile and an ordinary face, making people feel comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked at him. Men like Chase Harper were great. Sometimes, she even thought that if she had fallen in love with Chase Harper, then she could live a peaceful yet sweet life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, a car suddenly pulled over at Kyla's store. A woman got out, ran toward Kyla, and suddenly raised her hand to slap her across the before anyone could react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla instantly felt her face burn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're shameless! Why did you seduce someone else's man?" the woman shouted, drawing the glances of some of the neighbors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper quickly dropped the tools and pulled the woman away. "What are you doing? Are you out of your mind?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The woman said with hatred, "Chase Harper, you said you were busy when I asked you out. And now you're courting this woman? What's so good about this homewrecker? You should at least find someone younger and more beautiful than me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Samantha Dean, shut up! I just don't want to see you. It has nothing to do with Kyla. Kyla's my friend. I forbid you to talk about her like that!" Chase Harper snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Forbid? What's the matter? You're trying to find a stepmother for my daughter, yet I'm not allowed to talk about her? Did you divorce me so readily because of her? Let me tell you, Chase Harper. If you want to get rid of me, give me your shop in the market or everyone will suffer!" Samantha Dean roared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper instantly turned ghastly pale. "According to our divorce agreement, I've given you the house and most of my savings. I haven't even asked you for any child support. Samantha Dean, ask yourself who's the guilty one!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Guilt flashed across Samantha Dean's eyes. However, after seeing how Chase Harper defended Kyla, she immediately said as if she did nothing wrong, "Are you going to give it to me or not? If you refuse, I'll reveal the dirt on you and this woman. I heard her child is studying in the primary school here. Let's see who gets humiliated!"</p></div>
