        <h1>Chapter 197</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me, what will Grace think if she finds out the truth someday?" Master Reed said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason suddenly smiled, but his eyes were cold. "She'll never know the truth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed grunted. "Do you think that's possible? Now that I know, I'm sure one day, she'll also..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not get to finish his sentence before he was interrupted by Jason. "She'll never know. Right, Grandfather?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His cold voice spoke at a volume that only the two of them could hear. Master Reed saw a threatening flash in his grandson's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This grandson of his even dared to threaten him for the sake of a woman? An uneasy feeling welled up in Master Reed's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would it be true that in the future, his grandson would not be controlled by a woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could things get worse?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">-</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over the weekend, Grace rode the bus to the hospital where her grandmother was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grandmother's ward, however, was crowded with relatives. When they saw Grace, their faces were filled with all sorts of expressions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially her first uncle, second uncle, third aunt, and their families. They looked at Grace with fear and hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not bother to know what was on their minds. All she cared about was her grandmother's illness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace," her grandmother looked at Grace and called out with some difficulty. "Come here, let me take a good look at you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked over to her bedside and took her by the hand. "Grandmother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know, I'm sorry you had to go through all that." Grandmother's eyes began to moisten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just want you to get better, Grandmother," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her third aunt, who was beside them, could not help but complain, "Mom, just what did she go through? We're the ones who had to go through all that, okay! We were locked up for so long..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're the one to talk!" Her grandmother glared at her third aunt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her third aunt seemed to refuse to obey and wanted to say something else but was stopped by the other relatives. Several other relatives helped ease the mood. The topic was over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her grandmother took Grace by hand and talked a lot. However, since she was still ill, it was not long before she felt a little tired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse came in and told everyone to leave so that the patient could rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Outside the ward, some of her relatives left first. Grace's grandfather, Old Mr. Kelleigh, said, "Although your grandmother's illness is just dragging on, the medical expenses still cost a lot of money. How about this? All of you spread it out, and everyone can just contribute a fraction of it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her first uncle, second uncle, third aunt, and their families seemed to have known about this all along. They all looked at Grace at once.</p></div>
