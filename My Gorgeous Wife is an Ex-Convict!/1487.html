        <h1>Chapter 1486</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason raised his hand and turned off the faucet. He put on his bathrobe, walked to the mirror in front of the sink, and looked at himself in the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His wet hair clung to his cheeks, and the water was still dripping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The water droplets on his face looked like tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grandpa, the day you spoke of will never come. I'm not going to kill myself, and Grace's not leaving me. She and I are going to have a happy ending!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His deep voice carried firm determination!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">For the next few days, Grace and Jason stayed in the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace was free during the day, she would video call Lina, Kyla Corbyn, and Nelson. When Lina and Kyla Corbyn found out Grace and Jason had reconciled, they both gave her their blessings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn had no idea what happened, but Lina did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina privately asked Grace, "Are you really over it?" After all, she was involved in the case from the beginning to the end. She knew how much her best friend had suffered in prison and how much the case had affected her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was even tortured to the point of almost committing suicide when she was in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, I'll... try to get over it," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's good." Lina was finally relieved. "My parents also said they would like to visit you and Jason during Chinese New Year. They've always wanted to thank you for saving my life! I would have died if it weren&rsquo;t for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Your parents have thanked me enough already. Besides, I would&rsquo;ve been dead back then if it hadn't been for you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Friends need not talk much. They both understood each other well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After arranging the time for the Chinese New Year visit, Grace finished the call just to see Jason walking toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"By the way, Lina says she wants to come over tomorrow with her parents to visit us for Chinese New Year. Will you be at home?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Tomorrow?" Jason frowned slightly and said, "I may not have time tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you have something to do? Then I'll talk to Lina and take a rain check," said Grace. Then, as if remembering something, she said, "Jay, can you remove some of the bodyguards and security personnel in the house? There's no need to have so many people following me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It felt like she had a bunch of people following her everywhere she went.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was all right if she was indoors. If she went outside, she would be surrounded by a large group of people even if it was still within Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He hesitated a little before saying, "I can't remove them." He even wanted to have more men stationed by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why are you getting so many people to follow me? Do you... still think I'll leave you?" she asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He pressed his thin lips together tightly and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So you don't believe me?" She stared at him with wide eyes. "You don't believe me when I say I won't leave?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I..." He stiffened slightly and said, "I believe you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At the very least, he wanted to believe she was letting bygones be bygones and was going to stay by his side forever... However, his heart was still swollen with unease.</p></div>
