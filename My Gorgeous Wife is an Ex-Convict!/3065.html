        <h1>Chapter 3063</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. and Mrs. Hart, who are elderly, also arrived in Deer Capital. However, no matter how much they tried to persuade and advise, it had no effect. Even though everyone had come to a conclusion, Brian was still convinced that Valda was alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He doesn't even allow anyone to say the words "Valda's death" in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, after three months, the police announced that they had stopped searching. Only the Hart and Reed families were still searching for Valda's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace arrived with Jasmine in her arms and Jason to visit Brian, she could hardly associate the man in front of her with the Brian she knew from her memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person has messy hair, stubble on their face, and a thin body. Even standing up, they give off a feeling of being unsteady.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It looks like he's a beggar, who would think that he was once the entertainment industry's prince?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart saw Grace and Jason approaching, and said, "You should also talk to Brian and advise him to stop behaving like this. Although we really like Valda and hope she can become our daughter-in-law, but... no matter what, the living must continue to live well. Brian cannot continue like this, it's not good!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We will persuade him," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. and Mrs. Hart, who were elderly, have passed away. Grace approached Brian and said, "Brian..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian slowly lifted his head and said with a miserable expression, "So, are you really planning to listen to my parents and persuade me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." Grace faltered. At this moment, the gaze from those phoenix-like eyes looking at her felt so unfamiliar. This kind of expression was something she had never experienced before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want to advise me? To stop looking for Valda? Or to encourage me to pull myself together? Or maybe to suggest that I forget about Valda, and just consider her as a passing figure in my life?" Brian's voice was hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This series of questions left Grace speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How should she persuade these words?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although others may offer advice, she is not qualified to say these things!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, I know that no matter how many times I say sorry, it won't change anything. But I think if Valda knew that you've become like this because of her, she wouldn't be happy either. What Valda wants the most is for you to be well and happy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Am I okay?" Brian said with a smile that seemed to be mixed with tears. "I'm okay, but what about her? Why isn't she okay? Why did she risk her life to save your child, but lost her own life in the process? Why...why..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice grew louder and louder, while his phoenix-like eyes stared straight at Jasmine, who was being held in Grace's arms, with a strong hatred in his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He believes Valda shouldn't have saved the child! He should be the one to bear the guilt and regret! At least then, she would still be alive and with him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Brian jumped up and rushed towards Jasmine in Grace's arms, his hands reaching out to strangle her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason quickly stepped in front of his wife and daughter, asking, "Brian, what are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian replied fiercely, "Valda shouldn't have saved her! If it weren't for this child, she wouldn't have died!"</p></div>
