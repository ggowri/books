        <h1>Chapter 3574</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could this be considered a case of good luck coming from an unexpected source?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper couldn't help but smile wryly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyway, perhaps she can use this tissue to find out if Roger is actually Lawrence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back in the dorm room, Jasper packed the blood-stained tissue in an antibacterial bag and handed it to William the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not sure if this can still be used as a sample, since it wasn't immediately placed in the antibacterial bag after being collected," Jasper expressed his concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's have the staff check it first. If it's not usable, we'll figure out a way to obtain a qualified sample next time," William suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Jasper replied. "Thank you for your help, William."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No problem," he said. He would never find her requests troublesome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Holding the sample, William went directly to the most authoritative DNA testing center in Emerald City during his free time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when he got off the car and walked up the steps, his footsteps couldn't help but pause.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Based on the testing time, the results would be available in about a week.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Roger is really Lawrence, what would Jasper's reaction be when he finds out?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps he would do everything he could to make up for Lawrence. And if Lawrence asked Jasper to date him, Jasper might not refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he thought of this, his heart sank. If it was really like that, then... would he still have a chance?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And if he wanted to prove that Roger wasn't Lawrence, it was as simple as can be. All he had to do was switch out the specimen in his hand, and the result of the identification would naturally be different!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As this thought flashed through his mind, William shuddered and then silently scolded himself for his own despicableness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's willingness to entrust him with this thing was originally a sign of trust, but what about him? What was he really thinking?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Roger really was Lawrence, he wouldn't easily let Jasper go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He has been making efforts for so many years, just so that Jasper will eventually fall in love with him, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the person Jasper falls in love with wouldn't be a despicable guy, would they?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With this in mind, William lifted his feet and walked towards the entrance of the appraisal center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We'll know the results in a week," William said to Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A week..." Jasper murmured, suddenly feeling like a week is a very long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just one week, it will pass quickly," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, there's a charity banquet in Emerald City this weekend. Will you attend?" Jasper asked. Some celebrities and popular stars will attend this charity banquet, and they will donate some personal items for auction. All the proceeds from the auction will be donated to charity organizations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will attend on behalf of the Barlow family," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I will attend too," Jasper said. "My older brother and younger sister don't want to go, but my dad wants me to accompany him and mom. I didn't want to go, but if you're going, then I'll go too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William smiled lightly. "If you really don't want to go, then don't go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't feel so bored if you go," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a gust of wind blew and Jasper lowered his head, rubbing his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My eyes...it feels like there's sand in them," Jasper muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me see," William said quickly, using one hand to hold up her chin and lift her face, then looking at her closed eyes. "Which eye is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Left eye," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So he gently opened her left eye, blowing on it carefully before asking, "Is it better now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It still doesn't feel clean," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So he continued to blow on it carefully.</p></div>
