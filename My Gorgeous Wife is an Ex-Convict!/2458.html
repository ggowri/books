        <h1>Chapter 2456</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Perhaps I had a change of taste. I quite like sweet things recently." The sweeter, the better. Even she was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can eat sweet things if you like them, but there has to be a limit. Just don't make yourself uncomfortable." Jason reminded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the only one who could make him behave like a nagging old lady.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it," replied Grace, feeling like he was spoiling her as though she was a child! "By the way, I'll stay here for a while longer to handle Amber Mitchell's affairs. I'm not sure when it&rsquo;ll be over. Why don't you take the kids back first? They have to attend kindergarten. Besides, it's inconvenient for you to keep having video conferences in Deer City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at the person in front of him. Moments later, he smiled gently. "Okay, I&rsquo;ll help you take care of some things here first. I'll take our two children back to Emerald City in a few days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two got into the car. Grace was a little tired. She leaned on Jason's shoulder and soon fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared blankly at the face of the sleeping woman in his arms. He raised his fingers and carefully touched the bangs across her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were before, he would never let her stay in Deer City while he returned to Emerald City with the children if Brian was still there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was willing to agree and return to Emerald City first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it trust? Was it because he believed she loved him and not Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always been jealous of the possibility that Brian would occupy a place in her heart because of their shared childhood memories. Brian had also saved Grace and helped her a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, her feelings for Brian had never been romantic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I trust you, so make me trust you more, okay?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was slowly learning to trust and let go of that insecurity, but... everything needed time...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Kyla was sent back to Emerald City by ambulance, and Martin Weiss followed her in the ambulance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were accompanied in the ambulance by a doctor and a nurse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It did not feel too cramped with four people in the back of an ambulance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ever since getting into the ambulance, Kyla kept looking at Martin Weiss's gauze-wrapped forehead. She remembered that he had been hit with a camera. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure your injury isn&rsquo;t serious?" Kyla said somewhat worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss asked indifferently, "Do you want my injury to be serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly said, "No, that's not what I meant. I just..." She wanted to say that she was only concerned about him but recalled that he had told her to stop expressing concern for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, she bit her lip a little and said, "Thank you for protecting me. I'm sorry you got hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her pale face. Perhaps she did not know how ghastly she looked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had read the hospital report and knew how bad her liver was doing right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It had only been five years. The transplanted liver would never have deteriorated so quickly if she had not gotten pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Aborting the baby was the best choice, but she chose to take a risk. Was she so confident that he would not let anything happen to her and would willingly donate his liver to her again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla became somewhat uneasy from Martin Weiss's gaze.</p></div>
