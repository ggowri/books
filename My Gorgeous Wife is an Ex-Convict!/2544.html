        <h1>Chapter 2542</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman currently only had one umbrella in her hand. She wanted to block the rain for him, so part of her body was wet from the rain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't like people following me," Brian said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." The woman seemed to hesitate. "Are you really okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What could happen to me?' As if not wanting to talk to her anymore, Brian simply turned around and continued walking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he had just taken two steps when the umbrella followed him again to help keep him out of the rain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned around again and looked at her coldly. "I told you, I don't like people following me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I don't like to follow other people either!' Valda Theller wailed to herself. She was not a nosy person. However, she saw the man walking on the street in the rain. When she saw the look on his face, she suddenly felt uneasy, so she decided to help keep him out of the rain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... life isn't always smooth sailing. It's normal to encounter some trouble. We only have to overcome it," she advised him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's indifferent eyes suddenly looked at her. "What do you know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was startled by his gaze. She only thought that the air around her seemed heavy like it was frozen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man... terrified her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just... think one should cherish one&rsquo;s life when one is still alive. After all, we only live once..." she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly did not know whether to laugh or cry. "Do you think I'm going to kill myself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller blinked before her face suddenly turned red. Her expression made him know he was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This woman thought he was going to kill himself. It would probably become the biggest joke in the entertainment industry if others found out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What makes you think I'm going to kill myself?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because... you look like you're going to cry," she said a little awkwardly. It was how she felt when she saw the look on his face when he was walking alone on the street. She just thought the man seemed to have many sad thoughts in mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even wondered if the water on his face was also made up of tears in addition to the rainwater. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Cry?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his hand and touched the raindrops on his face. "I won't cry. You're overthinking it." He had probably run out of tears long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had already used up the tears in this life when he regretted it again and again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked even more awkward now. 'Alright, it seems that I've misunderstood!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was only one umbrella right now. If she went away, it would be tantamount to leaving him in the rain. However, she would get caught in the rain if she gave the umbrella to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Either option seemed weird.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Valda Theller could only continue holding the umbrella awkwardly, praying that the rain could quickly stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced at her strangely. "Why are you still standing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "If I leave and you stay in the rain... That's kinda inappropriate. You'll catch a cold. I've seen the weather forecast. This is just a shower. It&rsquo;ll come and go quickly. It&rsquo;ll soon stop."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her. 'Did she approach me on purpose?' Too many women had tried to approach him on purpose.</p></div>
