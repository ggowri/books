        <h1>Chapter 4044</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a low and rough voice came from beside her, "Who are you texting?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina turned her head and saw a handsome face that she had been looking at for 20 years. He had been by her side since the moment she was born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she had memories, there were three people who were the most familiar to her: Daddy, Mommy, and Chandler!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was texting with Eugenia!" Tina said, putting away her phone and looking back at the newlyweds toasting along the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I never thought Mick would get married so early. I thought he would be at least 30 years old before getting married."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Mick didn't get married, Tina wouldn't be too surprised. After all, Mick had never shown any interest in girls before, and she always thought he was quite ascetic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When you meet the right person, it doesn't matter when you get married," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But how do you know if the person you meet is the right one?" Tina muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler furrowed his brows slightly, his eyelids drooping. "Everyone has different standards of judgment, so everyone's answer may not be the same."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So what are his standards of judgment?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina really wanted to ask Chandler this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler had always been the person she was closest to besides her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their engagement had been arranged before she was born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although her parents and he didn't explain it to her in detail, she could piece together some of the past from her elders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was said that her mother had a difficult delivery when she was born, and the doctors were helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, they had to choose between saving the mother or the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mother still wanted to save the child, but her father wanted to save her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, Tina had no objections to this, as she understood that even though her father loved her, the person he loved the most was her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was because her father loved her mother that he had her with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And it was at that time that Chandler suddenly appeared, offering to help her mother keep the child, but only if her father agreed to marry him and promised that the child in her mother's womb would marry him in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This strange request was not only strange to her father at the time, but even Tina found it strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Chandler was only 8 years old at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An 8-year-old child... thinking of finding a bride for himself was a bit strange no matter how you thought about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But for her father at the time, this was the last straw, so he agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And so, she had been engaged to Chandler since birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, Tina also found it strange why Chandler wanted to be engaged to her. He even firmly believed that she was a girl in her mother's womb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And every time she curiously asked him about it, he just sneered, "You'll understand in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What kind of future was he talking about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had heard this sentence so many times that she gradually stopped delving into this issue.</p></div>
