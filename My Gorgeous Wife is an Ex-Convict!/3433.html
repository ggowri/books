        <h1>Chapter 3431</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The second son of the Reed family is staying with the Barlow family and being used by them. Are you really so easily fooled, Mason, or is the Reed family just easy to manipulate?" Veronica mocked, "Dad, the Barlow family has had their good days, and now you should be thinking about how to use the resources you have to become self-sufficient, instead of trying to keep Mason at the Barlow family forever! Did you really think the people of the Reed family were so easily controlled?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's every word at this moment is a great irony to Archer. "As long as you treat Mason well, how could Mason leave the Barlow family? He is so attached to you, as long as you are in the Barlow family, he won't leave!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica said, "That was when we were kids, Dad. Mason and I are growing up, we can't stay the same as we were back then forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In short, you are not allowed to have any conflicts with Mason. If you do something that upsets him, you must apologize to him immediately. If Mason decides to leave the Barlow family, don't blame me for disowning you as my daughter! Archer threatened firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During dinner time, Archer took the initiative to say to Mason, "Mason, Veronica wants to apologize to you. If she did something wrong, please don't blame her!" Then he turned to his daughter and said, "Veronica, didn't you say you wanted to apologize to Mason? Hurry up and apologize!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at her father and understood his intention. He planned to force her to apologize by driving the ducks onto the shelf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica kept her lips tightly sealed and didn't utter a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, stepmother Rosalind also said, "Hey, Veronica must be feeling embarrassed. We are all family, what's wrong with apologizing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, the youngest son of the Barlow family, Lionel, was looking at his sister Veronica and then at Mason, his eyes darting around as if he was thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at her father and stepmother who kept urging her and said, "Whether or not I should apologize is my own decision, not my father's decision to make. Besides, I don't think I have anything to apologize for!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You...," the three words "dead girl" got stuck in Archer's throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm full, so I'll go back to my room first," said Veronica, getting up and walking towards her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer and Rosalind looked at each other in confusion, and quickly started saying all sorts of nice things to Mason, afraid that he might get angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's gaze was fixed on Veronica's back as she walked into the room. He only looked away when she disappeared inside. He then lowered his eyes and ate his dinner mechanically, one bite at a time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel's eyes sparkled as he witnessed this scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the middle of the night, Veronica couldn't sleep, so she got up and decided to come to the living room to pour herself a glass of water. However, when she opened the door, she found Mason sitting by her room's doorway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was taken aback and asked, "What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This sentence is the first one she said to him in the past few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't fall asleep," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't sleep, so you're waiting outside my room? It's already late, you should go back to your room," she said, walking out of the room and heading to the water dispenser in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He followed behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you still angry with me?" His voice suddenly sounded cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was taken aback, angry - or rather, scared. It was fear of the unfamiliar that she felt, more than anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because they grew up, even though she always treated him like a younger brother, he was not one. He was the second son of the Reed family, and should have been a prominent figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he wanted to, he could easily destroy the things she cares about, and she is powerless to stop him.</p></div>
