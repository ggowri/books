        <h1>Chapter 2201</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson suddenly stiffened. Then, he slowly looked up at her as if in slow motion. "What... are you doing here?" he asked hoarsely with a forced smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was taken aback by the exhausted look on his face. "Are you exhausted from your trip overseas? You look so tired. Why don't you go home and rest? You can continue with your work after having a good rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said as she walked up to Hadwin Stephenson. "What time did you come back today? You didn't call me when you got off the plane."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of answering her, Hadwin Stephenson suddenly hugged her around the waist while his face was pressed against her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina froze. "What's the matter? Did... something happen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice was so gentle, and the weight on his heart only grew heavier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How was he going to tell her that the real culprit who almost killed her and their baby was his mother? How was he going to tell her that he had only gotten justice by stopping his mother from ever leaving the old castle? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not send the culprit to face the law and did not give her a taste of her own medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Will she blame me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could hardly breathe from the pressure pressing on his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing how silent Hadwin Stephenson was, no matter how absent-minded Lina was, she could sense that he was not exhausted but that something had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin, we're married now. You can tell me anything. Whether I can help or not, at least I can face the problem with you," said Lina as her fingers caressed his black hair. "You didn't forget the vows we made when we got married, did you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stephenson Tingxi trembled slightly and muttered, "I didn't, but I also remember telling you that I'll protect you and not let you suffer any harm!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the greatest harm she had suffered was because of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haven't you always protected Tina and me?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I..." Hadwin Stephenson hugged Lina tighter with a rare sense of helplessness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, it's alright if you don't want to talk. You can tell me when you're ready to talk," said Lina as she gently patted his back. "Let's go home. You haven't seen Tina in days. Don't you miss her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I miss her! How could I not? It's just that...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson slowly looked up and stared at Lina. "My mother was the one behind the poison injection, causing you and our baby to almost die?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina froze, then shock filled her face. "Your mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew his mother disliked her, but she never expected her to do that. It was equivalent to... murder!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, my mother." He smiled wrily, but the expression seemed like he was about to burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina held Hadwin Stephenson's face and said, "Your mother did that, not you. I won't blame you. All I know is that you've done everything you could to protect our child and me!"</p></div>
