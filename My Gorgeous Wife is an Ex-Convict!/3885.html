        <h1>Chapter 3883</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, don't think about it anymore." Jason hugged Grace's waist and pulled her into his arms. "Don't always think about the children. Think about me more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you even jealous of them?" Grace laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I am," Jason said. "Don't forget, you promised me that I am the most important person in your heart, and the children can only come after me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Grace's face turned red. The reason why she made such a "promise" was because he shamelessly used some tricks in bed. "How can you still say that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, I can say that." Jason lowered his head and kissed his wife's cheek. "This is how you express your love for me the most. How can I not say it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As you get older, your skin gets thicker," Grace muttered under her breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm only thick-skinned with you," he murmured, "even if we become grandparents in the future, you'll still have to love me the most, Grace..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His deep voice was husky and tempting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace looked into his affectionate peach blossom eyes. After all these years, his love for her had never changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a blessing for her to be able to receive his love. She had been truly happy all these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I love you, Jason. You're the love of my life," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their children had their own most loved ones, but for her, the man who would love her with his life was her most loved one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She raised her hand and wrapped it around his neck, pressing her lips to his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His Adam's apple bobbed, and the next moment, he took the initiative to deepen the kiss...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His wife, the love of his life, would always be his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he would always be hers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family began to prepare for Mason and Veronica's wedding. As a family of their level, the wedding was naturally not a simple matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wedding venue, the invited guests, the bride and groom's attire, and the newlyweds' house, plus the fact that Veronica was now pregnant, there were naturally many things to pay attention to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the Reed family had no shortage of capable people, and although time was tight, everything was arranged in an orderly manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's task was to choose a wedding dress, select jewelry, and find a new home for her and her husband-to-be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, there were people who presented various pictures and items for her to choose from, and as for the new home, someone would drive her there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All she had to do was get out of the car and see if she was satisfied with the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, while she was looking at the house, there would be someone explaining everything to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Overall, everything was easy for her. She could "busy" herself with her wedding, continue her studies, and even be pregnant without feeling tired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it was because of her good mood or maybe the baby in her belly was being considerate, but after reaching the eighth week of pregnancy, she didn't feel nauseous anymore and was able to eat and sleep well with good spirits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she didn't say anything, no one would even notice that she was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your wedding is in just over a month, and now you're..." Shirley lowered her voice in the school restaurant's private room. "You're pregnant. Are you really not planning to take a temporary break from school, give birth after the wedding, and then return to school?"</p></div>
