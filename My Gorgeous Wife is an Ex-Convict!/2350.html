        <h1>Chapter 2348</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Chase Harper was still hesitating, but Martin Weiss's voice interrupted their conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Neither of you can leave today without my permission!" With that said, Martin Weiss told the nearby Mallory Malcom, "Call the police and tell them my wife is at the train station with a strange man. Ask the police to come over and handle a civil dispute." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Mallory Malcom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla panicked. "Martin Weiss, don't be unreasonable. If you hate me that much, just come at me. You can do whatever you want for revenge, but don't do this to Chase. He's a good man and shouldn't be affected by me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A good man?" Martin Weiss walked up to Kyla and grabbed her chin with his fingers. "So does that mean I'm a bad man? Is that why you despise me so badly and refused to give me a chance despite how I begged you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." She tried to explain herself when she suddenly frowned and a faint cry of pain escaped her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Ouch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'My belly... hurts!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla covered her belly with one hand and felt the baby suddenly kicking violently in her belly. Every movement pained her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was more afraid than in pain. She was afraid that it was an ominous sign and the child was leaving her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the blink of an eye, Kyla's forehead and palms were drenched with sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was also as pale as a sheet of paper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss also noticed that there was something wrong with her, and his expression immediately changed. "What&rsquo;s happening to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My... my belly... hurts... Martin Weiss... hurry. Hurry and get me to the hospital... the hospital, okay..." She struggled to speak. This short sentence seemed to have exhausted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss quickly picked up Kyla in his arms and hurried back to the car. Mallory Malcom also quickly followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove toward the hospital like an arrow off its string.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, Kyla bit her lower lip, enduring bouts of pain in her belly. The sweat on her forehead soaked her bangs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Huge drops of sweat rolled down her cheeks, making her look paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her brows were furrowed from the pain, and every breath seemed so heavy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hands grabbed her belly desperately as if she were using all her strength to keep the baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss felt at a loss when he saw Kyla like this. He was distressed, but he did not know what he should do to relieve her pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't... Don't bite your lip. You can scream if it hurts. Or... you can bite my hand." It took a moment for him to squeeze the words out of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was biting on her lower lip so hard it seemed that she would injure her lip at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla shook her head. Moments later, she said hoarsely, "Help me... save the baby... okay... I... I know... you don't have feelings for me, but I beg you... to do whatever it takes... to save this child... I... I'll be grateful to you all my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her stammering voice broke his heart even more!</p></div>
