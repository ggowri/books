        <h1>Chapter 978</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stella, I think we shouldn't be too intimate with each other to avoid unnecessary speculation from outsiders," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before this, he had still been unsure about what he wanted, so he allowed Stella to mislead people into thinking she was his girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he knew what she was up to, he did not say anything. After all, she was his savior, and he would not mind if she wanted to use him to make a name for herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However&hellip; It was different now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since he now realized he loved Grace, he did not want Grace to misunderstand him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella's face turned a little pale hearing that. She sulkily lowered her head and said, "In that case... I... I'll pay attention to that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice sounded a little pathetic. However, with her head lowered, her eyes were full of resentment. Her hands were slowly clutching her skirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'It's all because of Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Now, Brian is already distancing himself from me because of Grace! Not to mention the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'If Grace gets together with Brian, then maybe Grace will tell Brian the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Brian will certainly believe Grace more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Then I&rsquo;ll lose everything I have now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella could not accept it when she thought of this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone in town thought she would marry into a rich and powerful family. She would be the town's laughing stock if she went back with her tail between her legs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'No. No way! I will never allow myself to be a joke!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'I must find a way to prevent Grace from taking away everything I have now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The atmosphere in the Bentley was depressingly silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason only lowered his head and played with Grace's hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had skinny hands with long and thin fingers. Some of her joints were slightly deformed. If one looked carefully, one could see some old scars on her fingers as well as on the back of her hands. There were also calluses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hands were not pretty at all and were even uglier than most women's hands. One would know at first glance that she had done a great deal of heavy labor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Jason stroked them carefully as if he was possessed. He refused to miss an inch of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if they were the most beautiful hands in the world to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace wriggled her wrists uncomfortably and tried to pull her hand back. However, Jason grabbed her hands a little tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A deep voice rang in the car. "What's the matter? Do you hate it when I touch your hand like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pursed her lips slightly. "It&rsquo;s inappropriate for our current relationship."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The touch of his hand would only disturb her more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'I want to keep my distance from him and calm myself down. If he wants to play a brother and sister game, then we should just do what regular brothers and sisters do!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Inappropriate?" Jason suddenly chuckled. "I remember you taking the initiative to warm my hands when it was cold. Why didn't you find it inappropriate then?"</p></div>
