        <h1>Chapter 3944</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you have a date with your boyfriend?" Irene asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I don't have a boyfriend. It's just some personal matter." Nancy replied calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I see," murmured Irene, then enthusiastically added, "Well, how about I introduce you to some of my really great friends?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No thanks, I'm not currently looking for a boyfriend," Nancy declined. "Anyway, I'm busy with work now. Let's chat later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Irene left, Nancy pondered for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other woman's friendliness made her feel somewhat uneasy, as if Irene's warmth towards her was insincere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But there was no need for her to be hostile. Nancy looked at the teddy bear in her hand. Since Irene had apologized, she would just accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After work, Nancy took the car that Mick had sent to pick her up and went straight to the technology building under the Reed Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The driver pressed the elevator button that went straight to the CEO's office floor for her. When Nancy stepped out of the elevator, she told the secretary her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Obviously, Mick had already informed the secretary, so the secretary greeted her warmly after hearing her name. "Miss Fowler, Mr. Reed is in a meeting right now, but he has instructed that if Miss Fowler comes, she can wait in his office."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, the secretary led Nancy to Mick's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked around the spacious office and felt like she was in one of those CEO offices from movies and TV shows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The gray and white tones exuded a simple luxury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And there were those large floor-to-ceiling windows that allowed one to overlook much of Emerald City when standing by them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This building was a famous landmark in Emerald City, but it was just one of the buildings under the Reed Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was clear that the Reed family, known as the wealthiest family in Emerald City, had a depth of wealth that was difficult for ordinary people to imagine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Would you like coffee or tea, Miss Fowler?" the secretary asked respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The coffee is ready," said Nancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, the secretary brought the coffee and left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy didn't know whether to admire the secretary's boldness for leaving her alone in Mick's office, or to wonder if she wasn't afraid that Nancy might steal some important documents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the coffee was quite fragrant. Nancy drank it while looking around the office and imagining what it would be like for Mick to work there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she finished her coffee and had looked around the office, Nancy saw that Mick still hadn't returned. So she took out her phone and logged into a small game she often played.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The game was actually quite simple, like a small game of passing levels similar to Tetris.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she was in school, Nancy had been obsessed with games for a while and had played many of them. Because games often made people forget about the troubles of reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But later, when she was a junior, her relationship with Clarissa deteriorated further, so she tried not to ask her mother for living expenses and instead worked hard to earn money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After graduation, she moved out of the Schultz family and found a job to live on her own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So she had less time to play games, and she didn't play the competitive games that required teaming up with others like she used to. Instead, she chose some casual and entertaining small games.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because the office was very quiet, Nancy began to play the game with single-minded focus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her fingers moved quickly on the phone screen, and her game score kept rising.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One level after another, Nancy didn't even know how many levels she had passed. At this moment, all her attention was focused on her phone, and she didn't even notice when Mick returned to the office.</p></div>
