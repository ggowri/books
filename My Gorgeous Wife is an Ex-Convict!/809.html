        <h1>Chapter 808</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not my..." She made a conscious effort to deny it, but in the middle of her sentence, the words suddenly seemed to get stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His black eyes were fixed on her. Those eyes seemed to show some self-mockery and sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina only felt a tightness in her chest. His eyes made her breathless. It was as if she owed him something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was silence in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? Why won't you continue?" His voice rang just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I wasn't going to say anything," she said guiltily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Come on, why do I feel guilty?' she thought to herself. They ought to know that they were not a real couple!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's just that some of his words... will lead me to have some misunderstandings. I&rsquo;ll mistake that... he might actually like me and that maybe he has liked me until now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, how can it be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What kind of woman hasn't a man like him seen? Will he really like me? Or some of his actions and words are just so that I can fall in love with him undoubtedly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When I do fall in love with him, he may just kick me away like when I had left without saying goodbye back then!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where do you wanna eat today?" he asked, changing the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just find a place with a mall nearby. I want to go to the mall and buy some clothes for Grace after the meal. She got a new job today, but her current clothes are from many years back and not suitable for formal occasions," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not take any of the clothes Jason bought for Grace, and Grace's clothes now were the ones she had before she went to prison. Although some of the clothes were of good quality, they were out of style and the colors had faded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Hadwin started the car, he said, "You're pretty nice to Grace. You always have her on your mind. I wonder when you&rsquo;ll have me on your mind like that too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ahem... Ahem..." She broke into a sudden cough and said lamely, "I... I always have you on my mind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" He glanced at her out of the corner of his eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If this woman has me on her mind, I wouldn't be so miserable! I've made my feelings very clear, but the woman doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She's so stupid... I don't know what to do with her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wore her old formal suit to work at the law firm the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a little worn, and the matching white shirt was a little yellow at the collar, but... at least it was wearable. Besides, she had no spare money to buy new clothes right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter was a man in his 40s. Grace knew in advance that his success rate was so-so and he had a mediocre reputation in the industry. However, since he could stay in the business for more than ten years, she would surely have something to learn from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a short briefing on the work arrangement, Lawyer Carter eyed Grace and said, "I've studied your case. You were able to reverse the case so quickly. Did someone help you out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whether it was a game between her and Jason, she had to admit that she would not have been able to reverse the case so quickly without him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who was it?" Lawyer Carter asked curiously.</p></div>
