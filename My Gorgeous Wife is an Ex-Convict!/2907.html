        <h1>Chapter 2905</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller spent a sleepless night and the next day, Camille Strickland took her to the mall to buy clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tomorrow is the wrap party, you should at least buy a beautiful dress and dress yourself up nicely. You know, there will be some reporters attending," Camille Strickland said. "You don't want to look bad in front of the camera, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, okay," Valda Theller replied. However, for her first comic adaptation wrap party, she really wanted to attend in a good state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two strolled through the mall, picking out suitable clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they reached the entrance of a luxury brand store on the first floor of the mall, Camille Strickland was interested and said, "Let's go in and take a look."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need, the clothes inside are too expensive," Valda Theller said. Even if she really liked something, she couldn't afford it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you afraid of? Just take a look, we don't have to buy anything. We can check out the latest styles of big brands and then go upstairs to look for similar styles in other brands," Camille Strickland said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two walked into the counter and were immediately greeted by a saleswoman who asked what they wanted to buy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller politely replied that they were just browsing. The saleswoman didn't say anything else and just followed Valda Theller and Camille Strickland around, looking impatient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially when another saleswoman next to them said, "Miss Schuman, you're here! We've received a lot of new products these days. Are you interested in taking a look?" The saleswoman next to Valda Theller and Camille Strickland looked even worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the saleswoman's income was based on commission, and the customers she was serving were obviously not able to afford anything here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, her colleague was serving a big client like Miss Schuman. If the deal went through, she didn't know how much commission she would earn this month!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, the saleswoman was angry and wished that these two customers who had no money would leave quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, show me everything," a familiar voice made Valda Theller and Camille Strickland stunned.</p></div>
