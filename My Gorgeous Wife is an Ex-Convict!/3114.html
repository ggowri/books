        <h1>Chapter 3112</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace still had her eyes closed, but her body seemed to have become even stiffer, and her eyelashes trembled a few times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at that time, I was too foolish, too foolish to realize that I had already fallen in love with you. I thought... it was just a simple liking. But it wasn't until the moment I lost you, when the overwhelming pain swept over my entire body, that I realized the fact that I had already fallen in love with you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, will you blame me? Will you think I'm too foolish, foolish enough to love without realizing it?" His voice continued to softly echo in the hospital room. "You said that when I told you I loved you, it was only out of pity, sympathy, and a sense of duty... If that's really the case, then I wouldn't be in so much pain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know? Even when I thought you were dead, I saw Jasmine and wanted to strangle her, to strangle the child you risked your life to save. Wasn't I despicable? To direct all my anger and desire for release onto a child. If Jason hadn't stopped me at the time, I would have made a huge mistake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His lips kissed her hand so deeply and tenderly, "Valda, I love you, truly love you so much, so...please, please don't abandon me, okay? If you abandon me again, I will be struggling in pain, and this time, no one will be able to pull me out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he finished speaking, Valda felt something wet dripping onto the back of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gradually, her hand back was becoming more and more wet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is that... his tears?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian... cried?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyelashes trembled, and at this moment, her pillow was also soaked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Valda woke up and Brian was still in her hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But both of them tacitly didn't mention what happened after she pretended to sleep last night, as if she had never pretended to sleep and he had never said those words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gently helped her to the bathroom to wash up, prepared meals for her, and almost acted as a substitute for crutches when she wanted to get out of bed and walk a few steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Camille entered the hospital room, she saw Brian lying on the sofa, and Valda was lying on top of him, with both hands still propped up on his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the look of it, it was as if Valda had pushed Brian down and was about to do something unspeakable to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Are you kidding me? She just mentioned the handsome guy plan, and Brian already put it into action so quickly? That's way too efficient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille muttered to herself in her mind, then made a face at the two people in the hospital room. "I know I'm not coming at the right time, but I promise to disappear right away. You can completely ignore me and continue... um, continue..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She spoke and took a step back, intending to close the half-opened door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait!" Valda quickly shouted, "Camille, don't go, it's not what you think! I... I just lost my balance and accidentally bumped into Brian too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille suddenly stopped in her tracks and pushed the door open. She looked regretful and said, "Oh, I see. I thought you two were alone together, like a match made in heaven."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked embarrassed, wondering what on earth Camille was thinking. "No, there's nothing like what you're imagining!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's quite a pity! If it were someone else, they would have been attacked by the vicious sheep a long time ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was at a loss for words and didn't know how to respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian broke the awkward silence by standing up and saying, "Alright, you guys talk. I'm going to step out and make a phone call." After speaking, she got up and left the hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were only Camille and Valda left in the hospital room all of a sudden.</p></div>
