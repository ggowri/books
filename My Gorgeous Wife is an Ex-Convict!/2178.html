        <h1>Chapter 2176</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William was only five years old. He was still so young...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at the remorse on her best friend's face, Lina naturally knew what was on her mind. "Alright, it's a good thing if we can clear William's name. Don't blame yourself. You've been trying to help William find evidence to prove his innocence, haven't you? You should be glad that you have evidence now. He didn't betray your trust."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, I should. William probably is innocent. He didn't push Nelson," Grace murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The police soon came out with the results of their investigation, and Nelson cooperated with the police. The conclusion was that Nelson did not hear the air gun when it was fired, but children with sensitive hearing could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, judging from where the bullet was found and the angle when it was shot, Nelson would have been the target due to the spot where he was standing. One could say that William had pushed Nelson Corbyn toward safety, but Nelson Corbyn had subconsciously dodged, which caused him to fall down the stairs in the end. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The investigation vindicated William, so to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn seemed guilty. "I'm sorry, aunt Cummins. It's all my fault. I didn't hear the sound, so everyone misunderstood William. I'll apologize to William. Without him, I might still be lying in the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's not your fault. It's just a strange combination of circumstances," said Grace. Not only was it because of the sound and Jasper and Mick's testimonies but also the fact that it took so many days for them to find the bullet. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The series of coincidences caused everyone to get the wrong idea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William is no longer with the Reed family. He&rsquo;s gone back to Deer City with his father. I'm afraid we won't be seeing him for a while, "said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn froze. Then, he showed a look of disappointment. "Then... I'll apologize to William in person when I see him next time. I'll... thank him too!" Nelson Corbyn said sternly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla seemed apologetic. "I'm sorry. I misunderstood William too. He's a good kid. Nelson and I owe him big time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, Kyla. Don't overthink it. I'll make time to visit William later. I&rsquo;ll tell him then! As you said, William's a good kid. He'll understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the evening, Grace looked at her son and daughter standing in front of her. She said with a stern face, "I've looked into William's case. He didn't push Nelson down the stairs. Someone shot an air gun. William heard the noise and tried to push Nelson away. You happened to see this scene and misunderstood."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace shared the results of the police's investigation with her two children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Jasper heard the result, her eyes instantly widened and she seemed happy. "William was trying to save Nelson, not push him down the stairs?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, we've misunderstood him," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's great. William did nothing wrong. He didn't!" said Jasper Reed. However, her expression instantly sank as she remembered how she had called him a liar and that she would never be friends with him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William kept saying he didn't push Nelson down the stairs. I... I even called him a liar and said that I hated him and didn&rsquo;t want to be friends with him anymore. He must hate me and not want to be friends with me now. It must be why he left with his daddy!" Jasper said with a nasal voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She regretted it so much. Why did she not trust William at that time? They were best friends!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Thinking of the times she did not defend him when the servants' children criticized him and caused him to be beaten until he was covered with bruises... Jasper instantly burst into tears.</p></div>
