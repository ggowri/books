        <h1>Chapter 3983</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The door closed behind her, and the driver did not come in. What came into her sight was the man sitting in front of the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy had seen Jason before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Reed family banquet, she had seen him from a distance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her impression, Jason was an elegant-looking man. Although he was already 60 years old, he looked like he was only in his early 50s due to good maintenance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, seeing him up close, she realized that Jason's appearance was very similar to Mick's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Jason, she felt like she was seeing Mick in the future after years had passed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be Nancy." Jason stood up and took the initiative to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Nancy replied calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason walked up to Nancy and pointed to the sofa, "Please sit down, I have some questions for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was ordinary, but it gave an immense pressure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy obediently sat down, looking nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On her way here, she had already thought about how the other party would treat her. If the rumors on the internet were true, she might not have a good ending today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Were you dating Mick before?" Jason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not really, but because Mr. Reed had feelings for me, we spent some time together," Nancy answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Jason asked with a teasing tone, "He had feelings for you, but what about you? How do you feel about him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sharp peach blossom eyes seemed to see through her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's heart trembled. Although they were similar to Mick's eyes, when Mick looked at her, she would feel moved and heartbroken. But when Jason looked at her, she felt immense pressure. It was as if any lie she told would be seen through by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am very clear that Mr. Mick is someone I cannot reach, so at first, I only felt grateful towards him. It was only after I found out that he had feelings for me that I had the idea of using him," Nancy said bluntly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Jason had specially arranged for someone to pick her up today, and even had someone waiting for her at the prison gate, he must have investigated everything between her and Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she must have used Mick's feelings for her, and as a father, Jason must have found out everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not many people dare to use my son, but you have quite the courage," Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know it was my fault. Mr. Reed, how do you plan to seek justice for Mick?" Nancy asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words seemed to catch Jason off guard, and he raised an eyebrow, "Aren't you afraid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether I'm afraid or not has nothing to do with your decision. Even if I'm scared to death, you will still get the justice you deserve, every penny of it, won't you?" Nancy replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was mentally prepared for the Reed family's retaliation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason suddenly laughed, "You're an interesting kid."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I've sought justice for others, it's only natural that justice is sought for me," Nancy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. In that case..." Jason directly threw a dagger on the coffee table, "Since you used Mick, you'll cut off a finger. After that, this matter will be settled, and you and Mick will have nothing to do with the Reed family."</span></p></div>
