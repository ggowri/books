        <h1>Chapter 3019</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda..." Brian felt helpless. At this moment, she was clinging onto the eucalyptus tree like a koala.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian... don't... pull me away..." she said intermittently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not sober at all right now, you don't even know what you're doing," he said. Did she know how much willpower he needed to restrain himself and say these things to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She propped herself up slightly, facing him with her round eyes glazed with drunkenness. She spoke in a slurred voice, "I... I'm very sober now, Brian. I really am."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He couldn't help but smile wryly. A drunk person claiming to be sober.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're really drunk, honey. Let me get up first," he said, trying to get out of this awkward position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But she didn't move, instead she wrapped her arms around his neck and leaned in close again. "I'm really sober, Brian. I want to have a baby with you... we don't have to have triplets, just a pair of twins... I really want our children..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Children..." he paused, then chuckled bitterly. How nice it would be if she said these things to him when she was actually sober.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she was willing to have a child with him, it meant she was willing to entrust her whole life to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now, she was drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll definitely have lots of children in the future," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want later, I want now..." she said, kissing his lips again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her actions were like testing his self-control. "Valda..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, I love you so much, that's why I want our child... You know? I... I really want to marry you... Valda, becoming Brian's bride... I want to grow old with Brian... I want to spend the rest of my life with you... My hand can still hold yours... And our ashes... can be put together..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke intermittently, and these words were like a "boom", exploding his remaining rationality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He couldn't help but embrace her and give her everything he could give!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next morning, Valda was still a little dazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she was drunk last night, she wasn't too drunk, just a little inarticulate and dizzy, and under the influence of alcohol, she was braver than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But she was clear about what happened last night, and her mind wasn't blank because of the alcohol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So now, she stared at Brian lying next to her, looking at the bruises and marks on his body, shocked by her aggressive behavior last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Last night, he repeatedly said that she was drunk and asked her to lie down properly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, she ended up suppressing him and even...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda doesn't want to dwell on it and hopes that Brian doesn't see her as a sex-crazed person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With gritted teeth, she carefully wrapped herself in her robe and tiptoed out of bed, making her way to the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And at the moment she closed the bathroom door, Brian, who had been lying in bed, slowly opened his eyes and a smile appeared on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Actually, he woke up just now, but he wanted to see her reaction. However, after staring at him for a while, she sneaked into the bathroom like a thief.</p></div>
