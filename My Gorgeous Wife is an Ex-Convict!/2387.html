        <h1>Chapter 2385</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are you going?" Kyla asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm going to meet Deer City's local tyrant and deliver a gift on my daughter&rsquo;s behalf!" Grace said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace came to the Barlow family&rsquo;s house in the evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow was a little surprised that Grace came alone. "Mrs. Reed, it's rare for you to come here alone. Did your two children run away from home again, so you came to me to look for them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I'm in Deer City with my friends for something. Besides, Jasper asked me to bring William a small gift," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Philip Barlow told a maid, "Call Young Master here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," the maid responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, William came down to the living room. As soon as he saw Grace, affection immediately appeared in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, aunt Cummins was one of the few who was kind to him even when he was looked down upon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Most importantly... aunt Cummins was Jasper's mommy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William walked over, but his eyes could not help looking around as if hoping to catch a glimpse of someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if reading his mind, Grace said, "Jasper didn't come with me today, but she'll come to Deer City this weekend. You can see her then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William's disappointed eyes immediately lit up after hearing the last half of Grace's speech.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jasper is coming this weekend?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, she misses you," Grace said as she took out the paper frog." This is the paper frog Jasper learned to fold. She asked me to give it to you. She said she'll teach you to fold many paper frogs when she comes over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William took the paper frog with his little hands and stared blankly at the words &lsquo;William&rsquo; scrawled on the frog's back. The girl&rsquo;s pretty little face seemed to appear before his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jasper misses me too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She hasn't forgotten me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William took the paper frog back to his room and held it gently against his chest as if he was hugging the person he wanted to see the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jasper, I miss you so much!" his young voice murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I want to... I want to see her soon! I'll learn how to fold paper frogs from her and fold many, many of them...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the living room, Philip Barlow looked at Grace with a half-smile and said, "Mrs. Reed, I don't think you're here tonight just to deliver a paper frog."</p></div>
