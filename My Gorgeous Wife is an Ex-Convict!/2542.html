        <h1>Chapter 2540</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's never going to happen," Jason interrupted Brian and slammed his body against the wall nearby. "Brian, even if you had recognized Grace sooner, Grace would still be mine.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Unwilling to admit defeat, Brian backhanded Jason and pressed him to the other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, the two men started fighting in the huge office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace reached the office after receiving a phone call, she saw Jason and Brian. One was sitting in front of the desk, while the other one was sitting on the couch. Their faces were bruised, and their hair and clothes were messy. It was obvious that they had had a bad fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men were surprised by her arrival, and Jason finally asked, "What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "The secretary said there were some &lsquo;noises&rsquo; in your office but they didn&rsquo;t dare to barge in, so I came to take a look. What are you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing, we were just exercising," Jason smiled and said. "I'll ask the driver to take you home first. Didn't the doctor also tell you that the most important thing you should do is rest well to help the baby grow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go back, but tell me why you started the fight," Grace insisted on asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together uneasily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Grace turned to look at Brian. "Is it because of my pregnancy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian hesitated slightly. He did come to look for Jason because of her pregnancy, but it was not why they started fighting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian could not tell her the reason they fought no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian simply kept silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace mistakenly thought she was right. "Brian, I don't know what's on your mind. But it's my idea to give birth to the baby. I want this baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But do you want to risk everything for this baby who&rsquo;s endangering your health?" Brian asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was slightly surprised. Amber Mitchell had probably not spoken to Brian about this, but he was aware of her condition and the price she had to pay to have the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not risking everything. It's not like I'm risking my life. I'm actually glad that I have the chance to have this baby," Grace said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, her hands caressed her belly, while her face radiated with motherly affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian suddenly realized that it was probably useless no matter how much he said. She was determined to have the baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, did she know what would happen to him if anything happened to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she know that all I want is for her to be alive and well? I'm even willing to sacrifice my own life for her to live healthily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she also know that I was in hell every day, suffering beyond measure after learning that she had fallen into the sea and was missing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, she won't ever know all of this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Because Jason is the only man she loves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason is the one she wants to spend her whole life with. I'm just a passerby!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, why... do you want this baby so badly?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because this is my and Jay's baby," she answered him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That one answer was all it took!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian left by himself. His suit was now a little messy because of the fight earlier. His bangs were scattered in front of his forehead. The marks left on his face after the fight were particularly eye-catching too.</p></div>
