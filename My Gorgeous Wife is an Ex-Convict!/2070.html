        <h1>Chapter 2068</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss started the car and drove toward the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla asked Martin Weiss which police department it was and called Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As Chase Harper had just reported it to the police, their records had not matched up yet. Therefore, Kyla's message came first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After learning that his daughter was at the police station, Chase Harper quickly thanked her and hurried to the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla and Martin Weiss came to the police station and saw Juliet Harper. At the sight of Kyla, the little one immediately shouted, "aunt Corbyn!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla walked up to greet the police officers and picked up the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you know how worried your daddy was about you running away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just wanted to see Nelson. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to go to your house, but Daddy has no time to take me," the little one pouted and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Your daddy's busy with work. If you ever want to see Nelson, just call me. I'll pick you up or bring Nelson to see you, okay?" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one immediately smiled and shouted okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"When your daddy's here, apologize to him. You can't do this again." Kyla lectured the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one seemed ashamed as she buried her face in his Kyla's arms. However, she still nodded obediently and rubbed her little head against Kyla as if she was being affectionate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla stroked the little one with a smile on her lips, looking so gentle. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss watched them quietly. The adult and the little one looked like mother and daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He recalled her telling him, "Martin, why don't we have a son and a daughter in the future? Our son will look like you, while our daughter will look like me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, they only had one son and no daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She even struggled to give birth to their son while in prison!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss pursed his thin lips. For the first time, he wished that they had a daughter. If they had a daughter, he would be gentle to her too, and he would love their child with all he had!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Soon, Chase Harper arrived. He froze a little when he saw Martin Weiss at the police station. However, his attention soon fell on his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before he could speak, Juliet Harper wisely said, "Daddy, I'm sorry! I won't do it again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her tender face was full of guilt and sorry. She even opened her arms to ask for a hug from her father!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at his daughter's behavior, what else did Chase Harper have to say? He already felt like he owed his daughter something when he divorced his wife. Whenever his daughter obediently admitted her mistake, his anger would immediately dissipate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper held his daughter in his arms and said to Kyla, "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Keep a close eye on her. We're lucky to have found her this time. If we didn't, as a parent, you'll regret it for the rest of your life," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll be careful next time!" said Chase Harper before looking at Kyla and Martin Weiss. "You and he..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We coincidentally ran into each other. Mr. Weiss helped find Juliet this time," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The appellation &lsquo;Mr. Weiss&rsquo; once again irritated Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you, Mr. Weiss," said Chase Harper before turning to look at Kyla. "How about I take you home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, I'll take Kyla home." Martin Weiss stepped between Chase Harper and Kyla.</p></div>
