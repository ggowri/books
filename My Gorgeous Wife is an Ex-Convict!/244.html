        <h1>Chapter 243</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face grew redder, and she tried hard to turn away to avoid his fingers. However, his fingers seemed to follow her, and she could not avoid them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't tease me, Jason." She gasped. Her almond-shaped eyes did not look as haggard as usual under the lamplight. Instead, they were inspired by anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked into her eyes almost mesmerizingly. There were many women out there with more beautiful eyes than hers, but they were the only ones that gave him this infatuation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if looking into her eyes made him want to dominate her eyes and not want her to look at other men with the same expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingertips gently pried open her teeth, feeling the temperature of her mouth. "What if I'm not teasing you? What if I tell you I can give you as much money as you want? Will you suffer for me then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could feel his fingertips in her mouth. They carried a touch of coolness as if they were constantly seizing her temperature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I only earn what I earn with my labor," she said, her heart still beating violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What he just said is a joke, right? Even if he can give me money, what does he want in return?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought as her almond-shaped eyes stared straight at the beautiful face before her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason fixed his eyes on her. His eyelashes quivered a little before he released his grip on her. He straightened up as he said, "Then I'll see how you trade labor for money later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was soft like usual as if nothing had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned for a moment. What... did that mean?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the next two days, however, things went on as usual. Evelyn never came looking for her again, and Jason stopped mentioning the same subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the Reed family's driver was still in charge of taking her to the Sanitation Service Center every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the car had been replaced with the most humble BMW, it still cost 2 to 3 million dollars! In the eyes of others, it was still a high-end luxury car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had to get on and off the car about 400 or 500 meters away from the Sanitation Service Center each time she commuted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was now at the venue where the extras were gathered for the shoot. It was the Reed family's driver who brought her there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she arrived, there were already some extras waiting over there. Therefore, when Grace stepped down from a BMW car, many of the extras were stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the car drove away, someone approached Grace and asked curiously, "Who the hell are you? The daughter of a rich family? You even have a fancy car to drive you here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A rich family's daughter? If she was the daughter of a rich family, why did she kneel again and again last time?" another voice said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn looked over and saw that it was a good-looking young woman in fashionable clothes with delicate makeup on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were two kinds of people who came to be extras. Those who were poor and needed to earn some money as an extra, and those who were not short of money&mdash;they only became extras to look for opportunities to be favored by the director so that they could have the chance to join the film industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This young woman, of course, belonged to the latter group.</p></div>
