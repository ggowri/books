        <h1>Chapter 2192</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was only because by staying here could he stand beside her with his head held high and not be outdone by anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not want to be looked down upon again and hear people say things like how he did not deserve to be the Little Young Lady&rsquo;s friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper looked blankly at William. When she heard that he wanted to be best friends with her, her dejected expression was finally replaced with a smile. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She quickly ran up to him. "Then... Then let's be best friends forever. Come and see me often, and I'll come and see you often!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay!" he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"This doll..." Her eyes fell on the doll he was still holding in his right hand. She now recognized it as the doll she had given him. "Think of the doll as me, and let her sleep with you every day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," he answered again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Also, you have to finish the chocolates I gave you today. They&rsquo;re very delicious!" she said. It was a pity she could not eat them with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he answered &lsquo;okay&rsquo; for the third time, she was finally satisfied. She did not look as sad as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper suddenly hugged William and gave him a big kiss on the cheek with a smack. "I'll miss you every day after I get back. You must miss me every day too! We're best friends forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The four members of the Reed family left, but William stood still, feeling his cheek burn after being kissed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He... would miss her every day. He would miss her very much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, come on. Let's get inside. It's so late now. You should have gone to bed long ago," said Chelsea as she held her grandson's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked down at the doll in his hand. Then, he said solemnly to Chelsea, "Grandma, don't throw away my doll again. I don't want anyone to touch it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if the doll was a treasure of great importance to him, so no one could touch it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason and Grace lectured the little ones after taking them back to the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, the two children had caused such a ruckus. Jason would have gone to the head of Deer City's police department if Philip Barlow had called a little later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why did you run out to find William? You could&rsquo;ve just told us if you wanted to see William!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We were afraid that William wouldn&rsquo;t want to see us. In that case, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see him, but we&rsquo;d get to see him if we sneaked into the Barlow family&rsquo;s house," Jasper said persuasively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace rubbed her temples. She had no idea how to refute her daughter's nonsense for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Anyway, you can't do that anymore. You're still young. What if you had run into bad people..." Grace began lecturing the children about what might have happened to them.</p></div>
