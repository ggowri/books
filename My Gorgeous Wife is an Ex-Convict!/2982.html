        <h1>Chapter 2980</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Police, I reported a case. Someone is gathering a group here to beat up my boyfriend..." Valda rushed to the police and shouted. Seeing the police, she felt like she had found a family member.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But before she could finish her sentence, her voice suddenly stopped as she caught a glimpse of the scene outside the store from the corner of her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the storefront over here, those troublemakers who were looking for a fight are now lying on the ground in disarray, while Brian is still standing upright and unharmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What...what's going on? How did Brian end up winning?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he really win against 7 or 8 people all by himself so easily?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was a bit confused, while Brian walked up slowly and furrowed his brows slightly. He looked at Valda's messy hair and the scratches on her neck and asked, "What happened? Who hurt you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he said these words, he raised his hand and lightly touched the scratch on her neck with his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It's not a big deal if he doesn't touch it, but it really hurts when he does touch it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police officer standing nearby looked outside and then inside the store. He cleared his throat and said, "Let's all go back to the police station and make a statement."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, a group of people were all brought back to the police station in a bustling manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda was taking notes, she seemed a bit confused and unclear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, what happened was that your boyfriend got into a conflict with the woman from the other group, and then she brought a group of people to attack you guys. However, your boyfriend ended up injuring her instead, and then you got into a fight with that woman?" the police officer taking Valda's statement asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"More or less... that's about it," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take another look at your statement, and if everything is correct, go ahead and sign it," said the police officer as he handed the transcript to Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda signed her name and then asked in a low voice, "Um...are those few people badly injured?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She's afraid that if those people are really seriously injured, Brian will get into trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That depends on the assessment of the injury," said the police officer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the recording room, Valda looked around the police station lobby and didn't see Brian. She figured he was still in the process of giving his statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman who fought with her was still there, arguing with the police officer next to her. "What? We're going to be detained? We're both victims here. My friend and I were both beaten. Why should we be detained?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was startled by what she heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Detention?! Is that woman going to be detained?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What about her and Brian? Will they also be detained?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If I were detained, it would be one thing, but if Brian were detained... Valda's scalp tingled with fear. If Brian were really detained, it would probably become a big news story that would shake the whole city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mind was in a jumble, and when she saw Brian walking out of the interrogation room, Valda rushed up to him almost immediately. "Brian, what should we do? Are you going to be detained? Or... should I say that I instructed you to fight, and that you are innocent?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would rather be detained herself than have him detained.</p></div>
