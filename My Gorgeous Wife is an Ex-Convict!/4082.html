        <h1>Chapter 4080</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina and Kit separated, and Eugenia quickly ran to her friend, pulling her away from Kit and whispered, "Your brother Chandler is here! You have to be careful, you and Kit looked too intimate in the photo just now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Eugenia could finish her sentence, Tina had already looked up and started searching for Chandler's figure in the studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing Chandler, she immediately walked over and asked, "Chandler, when did you arrive?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A while ago," Chandler replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did you know to come here?" Tina asked curiously, as she hadn't told him the location of the shoot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I missed you, so I came to see you," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina blinked, not dwelling too much on how Chandler knew the location. After all, with his abilities, it would be easy for him to find out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you see how I did in the shoot just now? What did you think?" Tina asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia couldn't believe it. Tina was so carefree and asked Chandler about the shoot, even though she had just been so intimate with Kit. Was she really asking for trouble?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Tina asked with a pure and innocent expression, without any embarrassment, as if she was just asking about her work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For Tina, modeling and taking photos was just a job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Moreover, even though she and Kit looked intimate just now, there was actually no physical contact between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Not bad," Chandler said lightly. "Are you in a good mood because you were shooting with Kit today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Well, I'm a fan of his, so of course I'm happy to be able to shoot with my idol. And the team today is great, with Weldon as the photographer," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Weldon is a photographer of this level, and not just anyone can work with him. So for her, it was a good experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "If you were shooting with someone other than Kit today, would you still be in such a good mood?" Chandler asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What's wrong?" Tina seemed a bit puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He's jealous! Her future husband is jealous! Eugenia almost wanted to grab her friend's ear and yell at her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But... Chandler was right there, and she didn't dare to yell at her friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However... life is full of surprises, just like now. She didn't expect to see Chandler jealous, and she didn't expect that the next moment, Tina, who is usually carefree, would lift her hands and wrap them around Chandler's neck, then say, "Are you jealous of Kit?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia was stunned. It turns out that Tina isn't as carefree as she thought, and she even noticed that Chandler was jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Hmm," Chandler responded softly, shocking Eugenia once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This... he admitted it too easily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> For a man like Chandler, who is a CEO type, even if he's jealous, he wouldn't easily let the female lead know, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Why did he do the opposite when it comes to Chandler?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I only have the kind of fan-to-idol feelings for him. The person I love is you! And if you're uncomfortable, I won't do any more shoots with him in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina said with a smile that her mother had once told her that even if you're a fan, you need to distinguish between your feelings for your idol and your feelings for your loved ones."</p></div>
