        <h1>Chapter 778</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If he believes me, he would believe what I said to him in his father's mourning hall that day, that I&rsquo;d never betray him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If he believes me, he&rsquo;ll believe that he's the one I love!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If he believes me, he wouldn&rsquo;t have hidden Grandma's bracelet to deliberately hide the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... he doesn&rsquo;t believe me&hellip;' Grace only felt as though she was now soaking in ice water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pursed his thin lips. He told himself to trust her, but when he saw Brian appearing with her on his back like that and when she went to the hospital again and again to restore her memory without telling him, he did not know how much more he could trust her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What a terrible feeling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice once again rang. "If you can't even believe me, how are we going to proceed with our relationship? Brian&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough! I told you to stop!" His hands seized her by the neck, choking her to cut off her voice. "Does Brian believe you? So you can proceed with Brian instead?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian, Brian... Is Brian like an imprint in her heart that I can never erase?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he had tried again and again to erase Brian from her heart, he still failed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her thin neck was in his five fingers, and he could have snapped it with the slightest effort... However, his hand could not help shaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was shaking so much...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If others had angered him, he would not hesitate to strike. However, when it was her, it was as if hurting her the slightest would make him feel pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, do you know what cowardice is? It's when you hate someone, but you can't even bear to hurt them in the end."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His father's voice rang in his ear again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, I can't bear it! I can't bear it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she kept talking about Brian, he still did not want to hurt her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought he was in charge of everything, but in the end, she was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was in charge of his joys and sorrows, even his life and... future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If this goes on, will I follow in my father's footsteps?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Since I can't cut her off from Brian, will she go to Brian one day?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I won't follow in my father's footsteps! Surely not!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If loving someone is so painful, then I... won't love them!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The fingers around Grace's neck came loose, and Grace fell almost awkwardly to the floor while coughing furiously. For a moment, she only felt as if he had lost control of his temper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay..." she spoke in a slightly hoarse voice with some difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his voice that sounded at the next moment chilled her to the bone. She even wondered if she had heard him wrong!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's break up," his cold voice said something that seemed to make her blood freeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Break up?" Grace was stunned and looked up at the man in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I'm tired." He looked at her calmly, completely different from earlier. What remained in those eyes that once looked at her gently was now deep and bottomless darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if... his world had abandoned her completely and would not allow her to come any closer.</p></div>
