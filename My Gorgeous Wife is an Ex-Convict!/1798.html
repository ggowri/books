        <h1>Chapter 1796</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I guess so," replied Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What would you like to eat?" asked Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Anything that's light," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two went to a restaurant near the concert venue and ordered some light food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As Lina ate, the feeling of nausea came over her again. She hurriedly rushed to the washroom to throw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She threw up for quite a while before coming out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman asked with concern, "What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's morning sickness," said Lina. She did not hide it from him. After all, she had agreed to go out with him to tell him about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Morning sickness?" Anthony Sherman was stunned. His expression froze, and he could not react in time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It&rsquo;s a hormonal reaction that pregnant women face, causing us to get morning sickness,&rdquo; explained Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman said, "I know what morning sickness is. You have morning sickness. Are you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, I'm pregnant. Sorry," she said. Her round eyes were clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman suddenly understood why he always had a good impression of Lina. It was because she was very straightforward and would not hide things from people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman said, "There's nothing to be sorry about. We agreed to be friends. But now that you're pregnant, you can't go to the concert afterward. Why don't we give these two tickets to those who couldn&rsquo;t get tickets and are waiting outside the venue? Then these tickets can be put to good use."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But... you had a hard time getting them. I'll pay you for them. I can't let you spend too much money," Lina hastened to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman said, "That won't be necessary. What's your plan for the future? Have you told Hadwin Stephenson about this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina immediately felt speechless. She had never said that the baby was Hadwin Stephenson&rsquo;s, but everyone could figure out they were Hadwin Stephenson's upon learning she was pregnant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Was it that easy to figure out?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He... uh... knows about it," Lina said vaguely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman did not pursue it and just said, "If you need any help in the future, feel free to contact me. I&rsquo;ll do whatever I can to help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked at him in surprise. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Aren't we friends? It's normal for friends to help each other out. Lina, I only wish you happiness," Anthony Sherman said sincerely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Thank you," said Lina as she bit her lower lip. She felt even more sorry upon seeing Anthony Sherman&rsquo;s reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After finishing their meal, they arrived at a concert hall. Anthony Sherman gave the concert tickets to a young couple waiting outside because they had failed to get them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They said gratefully, "Thank you. Thank you! I wish you two a lifetime of happiness together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Huh?" Lina was about to explain that they were not together but the young couple had already raced to the entrance with the tickets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina could only look at Anthony Sherman awkwardly.</p></div>
