        <h1>Chapter 2337</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She missed the rare loving moments they shared between them so much...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, he ended the kiss as his fingers went over her wet lips. "Now, it's enough. Got it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She came to her senses, her eyes glazing over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Something seemed to stir in her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took a step backward awkwardly as she panted slightly. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you not want to continue? Or is your determination to find your friend no more than that?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lip. She had a fear she could not articulate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What am I afraid of? It&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s our first time sleeping with each other. Besides, I'm in love with him! Even if he doesn't love me anymore and has forgotten his feelings for me, I still remember them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No... I don't want to sleep with him under such circumstances. I don't want him to do such a thing when he doesn't love me at all.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla clenched her hands, trying hard to accept the reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned deeply. Her trembling body was like a silent rejection. Even though she did not struggle or resist, the sight of her now upset him even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, is this how you're going to make me want you willingly? You look like you&rsquo;re forcing yourself. Weren't you laughing and talking happily with Chase Harper earlier? What's the matter? Why are you giving me that look? Is Chase Harper the only person you&rsquo;ll try your best to charm?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A clear and loud slap rang in the room. Martin Weiss's face was slapped sideways.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked blankly at her hand. The next moment, Martin Weiss's fingers gripped her hand, his handsome face full of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, how dare you? How dare you slap me for Chase Harper? What's the matter? Is Chase Harper so important to you that you won&rsquo;t even tolerate others mentioning him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meeting his anger-filled eyes, her red lips quivered as she said, "I didn't do it for Chase Harper. I did it for myself. I've only ever fallen in love with one man. There's no one else! You can insult me all you want, but... don't insult that relationship!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her darkly. Her eyes were clear, while he was flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly straightened up, hurriedly took his coat, and hurried out of the hotel room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he would be utterly defeated if he met her eyes again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The room was suddenly deserted. Kyla put her clothes back on with a bitter smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her palm still hurt as if it was telling her how hard she had hit him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but smile ruefully. Had she screwed everything up? Martin Weiss would probably reject her request all the more after that slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shuffled out of bed, put her clothes on again one by one, and caressed her belly. "Did I scare you, baby? Don't worry. I&rsquo;ll take good care of you and make sure you're born safe and sound!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss returned to the car in a fluster. However, as soon as he closed his eyes, what Kyla said to him last and her clear eyes kept popping up in his mind.</p></div>
