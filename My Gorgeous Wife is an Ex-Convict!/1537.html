        <h1>Chapter 1535</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Was it Uncle Kwan and Terrence?' Grace looked at the two men and saw surprise in their eyes too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Daddy took me to sweep your tomb before. Your picture is on the tombstone," said Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace really choked this time. 'Tomb... A photo on the tombstone?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at the indifferent Jason who was sitting on the couch nearby. He... had brought their son to sweep her tomb. What a scene that would have been!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why were you sweeping Mommy's tomb?" Another childlike voice rang out. Jasper asked with a puzzled face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Because Mommy's dead," said Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But Mommy's alive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Everyone says that Mommy is dead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, the two children launched into a heated dispute over whether Grace was alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was speechless from the conversation and quickly said, "Alright, stop! I'm still alive and well. It was a misunderstanding! Mick, I'm back. I'm sorry. I've been gone for a long time, and I won't leave you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's eyes reddened as she sobbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She remembered back when the triplets were still in her belly. She remembered every movement they made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She thought she only had Jasper, but now she had Mick too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, compared to Grace's excitement, Mick Reed's expression did not change. It was as if it did not matter to him whether his mother was still alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if his mother was only a symbol to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It doesn't matter even if you leave," said Mick Reed. Even his tone of voice was very similar to Jason's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's eyes became redder. She had not fulfilled her motherly duties to Mick in these five years. It was normal for her son to be so indifferent to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I have no plans to leave. You're going to see me every day from now on. Come, call me &lsquo;Mommy&rsquo;!" Grace said as she wrapped her arms around the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed was uncomfortable and wanted to resist. Although he was only five years old, he was rarely hugged. Now, he was being hugged by his mother whom he just met today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Didn't you give me up? Why do you... want me to call you &lsquo;Mommy&rsquo;?" Mick Reed unconsciously bit on his lower lip with his pearly whites. He did not need a mother. He had been fine without one anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... was this what a mother's hug felt like? When he watched cartoons, the little mouse in the cartoon show liked to be hugged by its mother. Each time, he would just wonder what was so good about a hug!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I don't want such a hug!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But... Mommy's hug is so warm.' For a moment, Mick Reed hesitated whether to push Grace away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said quickly, "I never gave you up! Mick, you're my baby. How could I have possibly given you up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as she said that, Jason, who had been sitting on the couch, frowned. Two figures flashed through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The figures were locked in an embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you want me? If you want me, I'll give myself to you. I'll give you everything I have." It was... his voice!</p></div>
