        <h1>Chapter 3906</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His cheek gently rubbed against her palm. "Don't say sorry. I couldn't share the pain of giving birth with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If possible, he really wishes he could give birth for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's fingertips traced the corner of Mason's eye. "What if I have a second or third child in the future? If you cry like that every time, I'll feel sorry for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He frowned. "One is enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he had to see her go through that kind of pain again, he didn't know if he could handle it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt like she was one of those people who forget the pain once the wound has healed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During childbirth, the pain was unbearable. She didn't want to go through it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when she woke up and saw her daughter, she felt like it was all worth it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's have three. Three children would make a lively home," Veronica said. The thought of being surrounded by three cute little boys made her feel excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked forward to that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Three?" Mason's brow furrowed even more. If he hadn't seen her in pain during childbirth, he would respect her decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, even if it was just one more child, he was afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, let's not have any more. One daughter is enough. If you really like children, we can adopt as many as you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, Veronica could feel his skin trembling under her palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica pursed her lips. She knew that Mason was still traumatized by her childbirth experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that she had suddenly said she wanted two more children, he naturally would be worried and afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't want this to become a psychological shadow for him, so she said, "Okay, I understand. Don't worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She comforted him, after all, having a baby should be taken slowly, and she wanted to have another baby to make their family happier, not to make him worry all the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, let's think about these things later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them talked for a long time until she gradually became sleepy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... want to sleep a little longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, you sleep, I'll watch over you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But... you haven't slept for a long time either. Let the nurse take care of it, and you should rest too," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not tired," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Besides, I'll feel more at ease staying by your and the baby's side. After you wake up, I'll go to sleep. So for now, just sleep well," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica had known Mason for so many years, so she naturally knew that sometimes when he made a decision, it was difficult to change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially now that he was still in a tense state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although others may not be able to feel it, they had been together for so many years, and she could naturally feel it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Veronica was really exhausted at the moment, so after a while, she fell into a deep sleep again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason looked at his wife's sleeping face and gently kissed the palm of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can't have anything happen, absolutely not! We want to grow old together in peace and safety." It was like a vow!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p></div>
