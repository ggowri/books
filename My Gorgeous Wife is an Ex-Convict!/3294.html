        <h1>Chapter 3292</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It should be," Kyla said. "I've heard Grace mention the child's mother before. Apparently, she's a bit scheming and has been using her son's relationship with Jasper to her advantage, always trying to gain something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda frowned slightly upon hearing this. Given the Reed family's status in Emerald City, it was natural that they could gain many benefits by using the Reed family as a means to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when things go too far, it's natural for problems to arise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've heard Grace say that Lawrence's child seems to be quite good, humble and polite, and knows how to behave," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's a pity that the child's parents aren't very good, especially the mother. Grace said she even has a gambling addiction," Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grace will handle it, but I'm afraid it's not a small matter," said Amber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Grace is on her way back. Along the way, she quickly got an understanding of the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In short, Wilona has been carrying the reputation of being associated with the Reed family outside, borrowing money to gamble. She kept borrowing money without paying it back. Others hoped that she could use her connection with the Reed family to do some business, but Wilona took the money and never followed through. This eventually raised suspicion among others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then today, several creditors came together to collect debts from Wilona, and things got out of hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few people took Wilona directly to the doorstep of the Reed family's mansion to demand an explanation. Lawrence was also present at the time, so he is now also at the doorstep of the Reed family's mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace checked the time and realized that Jasper and Mick went to Jason's company earlier today and they haven't returned home yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is also good, after all, it's better for the child not to see that scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they returned to the Reed House, the butler hurriedly approached and said, "Madam, as per your instructions, everyone has been taken to the hall."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about Lawrence?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lawrence is also in the hall, originally... I thought of taking him elsewhere, but the child seemed very scared and refused to leave his mother's side," said the butler. He naturally couldn't use force to pull the child away, so he had no choice but to let the child continue to stay with Wilona."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I understand," said Grace as she arrived in the hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the lobby, Wilona had disheveled hair and her face showed signs of bruising, indicating that she had been beaten. Several men and women were surrounding her, angrily scolding her. Lawrence was standing next to Wilona, tightly holding onto her clothes and looking visibly frightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at Lawrence like this, Grace feels a little sorry for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I quite like Lawrence, but Wilona's influence on the child...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lawrence, could you please go to another room with the butler for a moment? Auntie Grace will take care of your mommy's matter," Grace said as she approached Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Lawrence saw Grace, his fearful expression reduced somewhat, but when he heard that she should leave first, he seemed somewhat unwilling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace gently patted Lawrence's head and said, "You being here makes it difficult for Auntie Grace to handle this situation. Once you leave, I can help your mommy." As she spoke, Grace glanced briefly at Wilona.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona understood and quickly said to her son, "You go out with the butler first. Mommy will come out in a moment, and Mrs. Reed will help me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence then followed the butler and left.</p></div>
