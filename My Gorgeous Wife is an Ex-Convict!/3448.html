        <h1>Chapter 3446</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It feels like something has happened, but she is completely confused about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other side, Mason put away his phone and closed his eyes. However, the scene of Veronica and Daniel together that he had seen before once again appeared in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She... agreed to Daniel's confession, but what about him? Is he just a younger brother in her heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And then there's Daniel, who turned out to be even braver than he thought. Despite knowing about his different feelings for Veronica, he still confessed his love to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The name Daniel seems to have become a thorn in his heart. As long as Veronica likes Daniel, this thorn will always be there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car arrived at the Reed House, and Mason got out and walked inside the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sudden return of Mr. Mason surprised the Reed family's servants. Usually, when Mr. Mason comes back, it's on weekends or holidays, and it's always on specific days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Mason walked into the living room of the main house, Jasper immediately exclaimed upon seeing him, "Mason, why are you back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Today, I want to come back and live here," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was taken aback, "Are we staying here tonight instead of going back to the Barlow family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mmm, not going back," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's great! Mason, you haven't had dinner yet, have you? Let's eat together later!" Jasper said. "Our parents will be back soon, and if they find out that you're staying over tonight, they'll be very happy too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper walked quickly towards the kitchen while speaking, intending to tell the chef to make some dishes that Mason likes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was staring at his younger brother and asked, "Did something happen?" only after Jasper left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason turned to Mick and asked, "What do you think will happen, big brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it related to Veronica?" asked Mick. There must be a reason for the unusual situation, and the reason that usually makes his younger brother behave unusually is related to Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason tightly pursed his lips and remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick raised his eyebrows, it was indeed related to Veronica. However, looking at his younger brother's current state, he might not be able to ask anything even if he wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long after, Jason and Grace returned. They were slightly surprised to see their second son there and planning to stay the night, but they didn't ask any questions and just went along with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a good dinner, Jasper eagerly asked Mason all sorts of questions, clearly delighted about Mason's sudden return to stay with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Will you come back to stay often, Mason?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Do you often stay with the Reed family? Mason's eyelashes trembled slightly. Would Veronica be upset or happy if he stayed with them frequently?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Jasper's phone rang, and it was a video call from William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper answered the call and William's situation appeared on the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although William is currently in Deer Capital, he almost always has a video call with Jasper every night. Over the years, this has become a habit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was clearly surprised when he saw Mason next to Jasper, but he quickly recovered and greeted them. They started chatting casually, and when Jasper needed to use the restroom, she asked Mason to hold her phone for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, two teenagers faced each other, staring at their phone screens with wide eyes.</p></div>
