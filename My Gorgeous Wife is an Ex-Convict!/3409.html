        <h1>Chapter 3407</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car slowly drove away from the hotel. The young man lowered his head and looked at the wooden figurine in his palm. If Jasper were here, she would recognize this wooden figurine as one of the dolls she gave to Lawrence as a set of wooden toys for playing house. However, at this moment, there was a dark brown stain on the wooden figurine in the young man's hand, which had seeped into the wood and could not be removed. But if someone knowledgeable looked at it, they would see that the stain on the wood was actually...bloodstains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The young man's fingers repeatedly rubbed the wooden figurine, and then he tightly held it in his palm, letting the hard wood hurt his palm. "Jasper, do you regret it?" The young man murmured these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the only response was silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One day, he would return to Jasper and ask her face to face if she regretted not answering his call and not extending a helping hand to his family. If the Reed family had helped them at that time, maybe...his parents would not have died in that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family, Jasper...one day, they would definitely meet again...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car is driving in the darkness, just like how there are many things in this world that are hidden in the shadows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The birthday party of the Reed triplets ended perfectly and became a topic of conversation among many people in Emerald City for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At Veronica's school, Veronica and Mason are also the center of attention among their classmates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, the focus of attention is on Mason, while Veronica is only receiving attention because she is Mason's "big sister".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In school, most people, whether they are teachers or students, know that if they want Mason's help with something, they must first please Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Veronica is willing to speak up to Mason, he will agree to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, many people flatter and please Veronica on the surface, but behind her back, they gossip about her and think that she only took advantage of knowing Mason since childhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica once again rejected the proposal of the class president from the next classroom, his face immediately fell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The school requires each grade to organize an activity as part of the school anniversary celebration. If Mason agrees to perform with us on stage, it will definitely have a great effect and the teachers will also praise us. What's wrong with that?" Leyna said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He doesn't enjoy participating in any performances, and he doesn't have any special talents in that area either. You can go find other people to perform with," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that this kind of group performance was like being a puppet for Mason, which he didn't enjoy, so she helped him decline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can talk to him. Everyone says that as long as you ask, he will definitely agree. Besides, it doesn't matter if you don't have any special skills in performing. He looks so good and he's a celebrity in our school. Just standing on stage will be enough!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What Leyna didn't say is that Mason is the second son of the Reed family. If he participates in this performance, they can get whatever kind of costumes, decorations, and makeup they want, and the Reed family will sponsor it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And if she could perform on the same stage as Mason, then she would have more opportunities to get in touch with him, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her opinion, Mason is not good at dealing with people, and Veronica is only not particularly close to Mason because she spends more time with him.</p></div>
