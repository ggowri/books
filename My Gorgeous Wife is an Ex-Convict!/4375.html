        <h1>Chapter 4373 Changes in Mood</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reporter swallowed, then cautiously said, "I saw Miss Hart talking to this man, then she voluntarily placed her hand on his face, and then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere felt like a low-pressure system was rolling in. As the reporter kept talking, Lornell's complexion got worse and worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the reporter finally finished recounting </span><span>everything</span><span> he had seen that day, the room fell into complete silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reporter looked at Lornell with fear in his eyes, and after a while, he pleaded in a low voice, "Mr. Quentin, please let me go. I've told you everything! I don't want the money </span><span>anymore,</span><span> I'll give it back to you later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell pursed his thin lips, mechanically flipping through the photos in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long pause, he finally said, "You don't need to pay me back. I'll keep these photos, but you're not allowed to have any copies. If I ever find these photos somewhere else in the future, you'll regret it for the rest of your life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reporter was so scared that he was shaking, repeatedly agreeing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, about our conversation today, I don't want anyone else to know. If anyone asks you about it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't say a word, I swear. These injuries on me? I just had the misfortune of running into some drunk thugs on the street and they beat me up for no reason!" the reporter immediately assured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the reporter had left, Lornell turned to his subordinates and said, "You guys can leave too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A moment later, Lornell was the only one left in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his gaze to the photo in his hand, looking at Harley in the picture, his hand gently resting on the face of the man named Calvert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, he never imagined that one day, seeing Harley being intimate with another man would stir up a surge of nameless anger in him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if something had been stolen away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was just his childhood </span><span>fianc</span><span>&eacute;e, a commitment he had made out of curiosity. In his eyes, it had always been nothing more than a childhood game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because the Hart family and the Quentin family's backgrounds matched up in Beijing, he didn't rule out the possibility of spending his life with Harley in the future. After all, she had a good personality and she liked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being liked by others was always better than liking someone else. Besides, he wasn't interested in liking anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she proposed to break off their engagement, he didn't feel bad about it at all. After all, he was never the type to force others. As long as it didn't disgrace the Quentin family, it was fine by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she once said she wouldn't like him anymore, that she would take back her feelings for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't pay much attention to what she said. After all, in his view, whether she liked him or not was a trivial matter. He didn't care if she liked him in the past, and it would be the same in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why was he bothered about whether she liked someone else?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he saw these photos, the faint, piercing pain in his heart made him feel alien and somewhat scared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like something was changing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if one day, he would regret some of the things he had done!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter what, he wanted to figure it out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the weekend, Lornell arranged to meet Harley at a coffee shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell sat by the window in the coffee shop, sipping his coffee while taking in the view outside. From here, he had an unobstructed view of the scenery across the street.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the sound of footsteps echoed. Lornell's hand, holding the cup, paused slightly.</span></p></div>
