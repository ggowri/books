        <h1>Chapter 1837</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jason..." The words gently came out of Mrs. Watts's mouth after quite some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason replied with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The atmosphere warmed up again. After the meal, Jason said to Grace on the way home, "Your mentor's wife seems to be afraid of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "She's probably nervous. She said it herself, it's the first time she saw someone whose name she has only read about in the newspapers. Mrs. Watts is only a housewife. My mentor feels sorry about his wife's legs, so he doesn&rsquo;t let her work. Naturally, she hasn't met many people. It's natural for her to be nervous when she meets you. After all, the rumors about you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Rumors? What rumors?" Jason raised his eyebrows and seemed to look at Grace with great interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace immediately felt awkward. The rumors about him were definitely nothing good. They called him ruthless and cold-blooded. In Emerald City, anyone who offended him would end up miserably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hmm? What rumors? They made your mentor's wife so nervous." Jason continued asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"They... say you're cold-blooded and merciless, and you rule Emerald City. Anyone who upsets you will end up miserably..." muttered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason took Grace's hand and said, "Then you can tell your mentor's wife not to worry. Even if she does upset me one day, I won't do anything to her&mdash;for your sake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said as he stroked her fingers. "Do they still hurt recently?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"They don't hurt anymore. I'm bringing Mrs. Watts with me when I go see Dr. Russell for a follow-up check-up tomorrow. I'll ask Dr. Russell to have a look at her leg," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you want me to go with you?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks. I'll just go with Mrs. Watts. If you go, she might get nervous again," she quipped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He smiled and did not continue the topic. However, his lowered eyelids covered the contemplation in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Was she really just nervous? But why do I still think Mrs. Watts is afraid of me?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it seemed to be a little different from ordinary fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, many people feared him, but Mrs. Watts's fear seemed to be mixed with some hints of expectation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Am I imagining things? Or is there really something else going on?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day, Grace took Old Lawyer Watts and his wife to Dr. Russell. She asked Dr. Russell to examine Mrs. Watts's leg.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After checking her leg, Dr. Russell said, "Your leg isn&rsquo;t weak because of your knee. It's because your hamstring was cut before and it didn't heal properly. The older you get, the easier it is for complications to arise. Besides, you've broken your joints before. That's why your leg never healed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts and his wife did not have much hope at first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, they looked at Dr. Russell differently after he said so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts asked enthusiastically, "Is there a way to heal it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I can try giving her an operation. It'll be much easier than what Grace had to undergo!" said Dr. Russell.</p></div>
