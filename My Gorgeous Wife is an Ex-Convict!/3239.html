        <h1>Chapter 3237</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, he had an urge to know what kind of person William was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does he live in Deer Capital?" Lawrence asked quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, he can also play the piano. Next time he comes to Emerald City, we can play for each other," Jasper said, then suddenly remembered something and said, "Oh, I promised William that I would record the piece you played for him. How about you play now and I'll record it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now?" Lawrence suddenly felt a bit uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that not okay?" Jasper blinked and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No...no, it's okay," Lawrence quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper smiled, "You play very well. Your teacher also praised you. William will definitely like your music." She took out her phone and prepared to record.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence sat down at the piano and when Jasper said "start," his fingers began to play one note after another on the keys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, Lawrence didn't know why, but he was particularly nervous and focused, as if he wanted to present his best self in this video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't want to embarrass himself or have William think he played poorly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he didn't realize that this mindset was actually a form of competition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing the video shoot, Jasper watched it again and Lawrence stood nervously beside her, asking, "Is it okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course it's okay! You played so well, Lawrence, you really are talented!" Jasper praised him greatly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence's face turned red again, but he felt less nervous now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later that night, Jasper sent the piano video to William, but she didn't receive a response online. She couldn't resist calling him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William, did you receive and watch the video I sent you? Why didn't you reply?" she asked, also leaving messages online asking if he liked it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I watched it," William replied, but his voice sounded a bit muffled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Jasper didn't notice anything unusual in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isn't Lawrence's playing great? Actually, if you were there in person, it would sound even better!" Jasper said excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William murmured, "Do you just like listening to him play?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it's really beautiful, and now he's learning with me from the same teacher. The teacher says he's improving quickly!" Jasper said. "When winter break comes, you should come to Emerald City. By then, Lawrence will play even better! We can play new songs for each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she didn't know that every word she said made his heart sink a little deeper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you like him that much?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's my new friend, of course I like him," Jasper answered without hesitation, "William, you'll definitely become good friends with Lawrence too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William lowered his eyes slightly, but he felt that he and Lawrence would never become good friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After ending the call, William looked at the video of Lawrence playing the piano on his phone again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the beginning of the video, before Lawrence started playing, his gaze was fixed on the camera, or rather, on Jasper behind the camera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The way Lawrence looked at Jasper made William feel uneasy.</p></div>
