        <h1>Chapter 1598</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Not far away in the dark, several bodyguards looked at each other. &lsquo;Is this really... Young master Reed?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They had a feeling that Young master Reed was a little different after Young Madam and Little Young Lady came back!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After the family of four entered the amusement park, Grace whispered to Jason, "You... You don't have to do that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But we're a family, aren't we?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace paused for a moment and saw his deep eyes looking at her tenderly. The gaze seemed to be saturated with longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Somehow, she felt that the way he looked at her was a little different now. It was as if... she meant the world to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, we're a family," muttered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed acted as the main guide in the amusement park. After all, he had been here once. However, the experience this time was different for Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There were a lot of people and children around them. They even had to queue for some of the rides, but... it seemed more fun than before. He had never been interested in riding those rockets or carriages before, but they seemed more fun when riding them with his sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">While they were waiting in line, the sound of a slap suddenly rang out. Then, a female voice could be heard saying in a tone full of disgust, "How could you scratch Lil Tian? Don't you know who you are?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked in the direction of the voice and saw that it was a well-dressed woman carrying a bag that cost at least 10,000 dollars. She was glaring at a little boy in front of her. From Grace's point of view, she could only see the little boy's back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was wearing old clothes and was about the same height as Mick and Jasper but noticeably thinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The woman... must have slapped the little boy earlier. Strangely, he did not cry or make any noise. He did not even raise his hand to touch his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On the contrary, another chubby little boy standing beside the woman was crying and shouting, "Ouch, Mommy! Ouch! He hit me just now. Mommy, send him away, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who has the nerve to send him away? Mason belongs to our family too. No one can send him away!" Another little girl stood in front of the little boy, looking like a hen protecting her chick. "If you dare send Mason away, I'll leave with Mason and I'll take my mother's inheritance with me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The woman instantly got mad as soon as she said that. "You darn girl. What do you mean by your mother's inheritance? What do you think your mother left you? Your father earned everything!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The lawyer told me my mother left it for me! It's mine!" the little girl shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." The woman's eyes were full of hatred. She raised her hand to slap the little girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, the little boy, who had been very quiet, suddenly roared at the woman like a wild animal. If the girl had not held him back, he would have pounced at the woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The children's father, who was standing at the side, hurriedly said to the woman, "Alright, alright. How can you take a child's words seriously? We came out to have some fun today. Why get mad?"</p></div>
