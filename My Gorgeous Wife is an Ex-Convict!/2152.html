        <h1>Chapter 2150</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, then. That settles it!" He turned to the doctors and nurses nearby, telling them, "That's it for the operation today. You don't have to stay here anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hearing this, the doctors and nurses quickly left the operating room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked blankly at Martin Weiss, unable to react for a moment. "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"As you said, I have no right to decide whether to make decisions for your body or terminate your pregnancy. I thought I was the one who cared about you and loved you the most. But in fact... I'm the one who hurt you the most, aren't I? I'm sorry I hurt you again," muttered Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He smiled bitterly, staggered back a few steps, and gazed at her. "Kyla, I don't want you to hate me, nor do I want you to never fall in love with me again... I hope you will... forgive me, though I know how much you'll... probably hate me after today..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, he turned around and left the operating room. His tall and straight figure now looked much older.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, Martin Weiss's subordinate entered the operating room. "Miss Corbyn, Mr. Weiss told me to take you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze. After a few moments, she followed them out of the operating room and into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the car, Kyla looked at the red marks on her wrists. She got them from struggling when she was forced to lie on the operating table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What happened today was just too much for her that it put her in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">From her being forced to lie on the operating table to Martin Weiss changing his mind and letting her leave afterward, it had been a roller coaster. She was still reeling from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car drove to the store&rsquo;s entrance, and Kyla got off the car. Mrs. Corbyn had been looking at the store&rsquo;s entrance for a long time. As soon as she saw her daughter get off the car, she hurried forward and asked, "What took you so long? How was the consultation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn said as she looked at the car again. Seeing that the driver was not Martin Weiss, she asked, "What's the matter? Didn't Martin Weiss pick you up this morning? How come he didn't drive you home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Something came up, so he left earlier," said Kyla. She did not want to tell her mother that her baby was almost aborted. "Mom, why don't we go inside and talk?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two walked into the store, and Kyla said, "The consultation results came back as expected. The baby's not affecting my health so far. It'll only affect me seven months later. But if I deliver the baby through C-section when they're seven months old, they'll have a chance of survival. I'll try to keep the baby in my belly as long as possible. The baby will have a better chance of survival if they develop well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She tried to downplay the results of the consultation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How much will that affect your health? If it's too much..." Mrs. Corbyn said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If it does, the doctor will operate a C-section on me and take the baby out. Mom, don't worry. There's nothing to worry about now that medical technology is so advanced!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was a little relieved to hear her daughter say this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the other hand, Martin Weiss returned to the car but did not drive. He just leaned on the back of the chair in exhaustion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He suddenly smiled bitterly. 'What have I done? Everything I did today only pushed Kyla further away from me. In the end, I shouldn&rsquo;t have tried to make her have an abortion against her wishes.'</p></div>
