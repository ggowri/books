        <h1>Chapter 1220</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The soft light fell on him, making his handsome face look a little less cold and a little more gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gentle...' She felt a trace of bitterness in her heart. 'Will he still be gentle to me? He chose to marry me, but only for the sake of our child!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're back. Did you visit Lina in the hospital?" Jason put the book in his hand on the coffee table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she said, glancing at the book on the coffee table and almost choking herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The title of the book was unexpectedly &lsquo;Being In A Good Mood Throughout Your Pregnancy Journey&rsquo;. It was probably a book about women going through pregnancy, right? Was Jason reading such a book?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I asked the maid to make you some porridge. Go eat first. You didn't have much to eat since waking up in the hospital," Jason said, ordering his maid to serve the porridge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not reject. Even though she had no appetite, she was no longer alone. She had a baby in her belly. Even the doctor said that she was slightly malnourished, which was not good for the growth of the baby in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she was a little regretful for being so busy that she usually just randomly ate something before calling it a day. She... was even lucky that the child was still in her belly after incidents like that. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Soon, the maid served the porridge and Grace took small mouthfuls of it. Jason watched her as she ate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gaze made her feel a little awkward, so she could only find a topic to reduce the awkwardness. "The porridge is... pretty good. Don't you want a bowl?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks." He refused lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then... the silence continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace continued to eat the porridge in front of her with her head down. Just as she was about to finish the porridge, Jason's voice suddenly rang again. "Let's go and get the marriage license tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace almost spat out her porridge before she could swallow it. "Get... the marriage license?" She swallowed her porridge reluctantly and gawked at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You don't want to? Do you regret agreeing to get married when you were in the hospital?" His brows were instantly furrowed, and he stared at her with intense pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only feel Jason becoming frightening again. If she said yes, he would probably condemn her to eternal damnation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately said, "No! I have no regrets. Since I said I&rsquo;ll marry you, I won't go back on it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pressure on her immediately subsided, and the sense of danger he exuded gradually faded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He got up and went over to her, raising his hand to pick up the grain of rice stuck to the corner of her lips. He put it into his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that the porridge is indeed as good as you said," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face could not help reddening. It was a simple action, but the way he did it was so flirty and seductive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then he bent down, and his sweet woodwind-like voice rang in her ears. "You know what? I'm glad you said you won&rsquo;t regret it. Otherwise, I really don't know what I would&rsquo;ve done. Maybe... I'd die with you?"</p></div>
