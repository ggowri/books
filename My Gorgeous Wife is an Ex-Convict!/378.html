        <h1>Chapter 377</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, another pair of lips that had never worn lipstick before appeared in his mind in its natural color.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That light pinkish tone looked so natural that it made him feel it was the best lip color.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Wipe it off,&rdquo; Brian plainly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Evelyn was unable to process his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I said, wipe away your lipstick now,&rdquo; Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was dumbfounded. They were now... on the way to an event. She had dressed up to the nines because she wanted to shine amidst the crowd. If she were to wipe away her lipstick, her makeup would lose its attractiveness. Then, she would not stand out in the crowd and instead become the joke of the town.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Now? But we&rsquo;re about to reach the location of the party...&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Now.&rdquo; Brian interrupted her. There was an expression of displeasure in his phoenix-like eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn had no choice as she dared not offend Brian. All she could do was bite her lip lightly, take out a tissue, and wipe her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Brian took out a silver bangle and looked at it. The pulp of his finger lightly caressed it and it was as if he was looking at his lover. Such gentleness in his gaze had never been seen before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the very least, Evelyn had never seen such a gentle gaze from Brian before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn looked into her pocket mirror as she cleaned off her lipstick and saw the gentle look on Brian&rsquo;s face. Consequently, she felt a sense of jealousy surge within her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She finally understood what the bangle represented because she had once taken a peek at Brian&rsquo;s drawing. The drawing was of a girl wearing a silver bangle on each hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She guessed that the silver bangle belonged to that girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Within the entertainment industry, it was rumored that Brian had been searching for someone. If anyone could help him find that person, that helper would receive endless amounts of resources within the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At first, Evelyn thought that the rumors were baseless as such kinds of rumors frequently surfaced and circulated within the industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, from what she observed, the rumor appeared to be true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person Brian was looking for was the girl in his drawing! Nevertheless, Evelyn had never asked about nor mentioned the girl she had seen in the drawing. However, she had secretly snuck into his painting room at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was when her sixth sense told her that he was definitely looking for that girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What made her more anxious was the feeling that the girl was Grace was seemingly getting stronger. Grace looked very alike the girl in the drawing back. Grace had a childhood photo where she was wearing the same flowery dress as the girl in the drawing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it a coincidence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Grace was the person Brian looking for, then... what she had now would turn into ashes?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was absolutely unacceptable for Evelyn. Even if Grace were that girl, she was not going to let Brian find out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason returned to the Reed Residence, he heard from the maids that Grace was home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he got to her room, it was pitch black.</p></div>
