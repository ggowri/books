        <h1>Chapter 3038</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William pursed his lips tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper said, "William, how could you say that to Simon? It's a good thing that Simon wants to learn the piano. You should apologize to Simon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A hint of sadness flashed in William's eyes, but he still said to Simon, "I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The apology was not something he wanted to say himself, but rather because Jasper wanted him to apologize, so he did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, alright, the food is here. Let's eat first and then we can go play later!" Grace called out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This restaurant also had a small amusement area with some well-made attractions that children loved, and as a result, it had received many positive reviews online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper cheered and immediately began to eat, and the other children followed suit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The dispute between the children seemed to end there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing their meal, Valda and Grace accompanied the four children to the amusement area to play.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Brian and Jason were still sitting at the table, sizing each other up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems like you get along well with Valda," Jason spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, we do," Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I didn't know any better, seeing you guys with Simon earlier, I would have thought you were a family of three," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, what do you want to say?" Brian asked directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to ask, when are you going to marry her?" Jason inquired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll marry her if she's willing to marry me," Brian replied frankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I look forward to that day," Jason hinted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, are you afraid that I won't get married and that Grace will keep caring about me?" Brian asked back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'm afraid Grace will care," Jason spoke frankly, "I don't want the person I love to keep thinking about you and feeling guilty because of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't actually need Grace to feel guilty about me. I've actually come to terms with it a long time ago. It's just that sometimes, falling in love with someone isn't something you can control. You can't force yourself to love someone, and you can't force yourself not to love someone!" Brian sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, have you fallen in love with Valda?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian didn't answer, he just looked over at Valda who was playing with the children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he fall in love with her? But even today, he still couldn't give a definite answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then his gaze shifted towards Grace, who was standing next to Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That is the person he has loved for so many years and held onto for so many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He once thought that after losing Grace, he would never be with another woman again in his life. But who could have imagined that Valda would unexpectedly enter his world like this, and the bond between him and Valda is getting deeper and deeper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So if this time, you encounter a situation like last time where Grace and Valda are in the same danger, who would you save?" Jason's voice rang in Brian's ear once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly jolted and then looked at the other person with a slightly embarrassed expression on his face, "Do you find it interesting to ask such questions?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to answer me, but the answer to this question represents who is the most important person in your heart," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then, if it were your child and Grace in danger at the same time, who would you save first?" Brian asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace!" Jason answered without hesitation, "If it's my answer, then I would choose to save Grace because she is the most important to me. But if Grace chooses for me to save the child, then I will follow her choice, save the child, and be with her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seems to represent everything.</p></div>
