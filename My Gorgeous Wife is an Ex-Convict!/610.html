        <h1>Chapter 609</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's surely a bit of an eyesore. Since she loves the news media so much, let her be thoroughly exposed," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From the way Young Master Reed spoke, Young Master Reed was absolutely pissed off this time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was unfortunate for Evelyn to get in trouble with Young Master Reed, especially now that Evelyn had broken up with Master Hart. There was no one in Emerald City to protect her now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence could almost foresee how miserable Evelyn's fate would be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, in the studio of Brian's mansion, Brian was standing in front of his painting of a little girl carrying a little boy down the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would paint the same thing over and over again, year after year. It was what he remembered the most...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every year, he painted more and more of the same painting. His painting skills also improved. The little girl in the painting looked more and more like the person he remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once, his mother had asked him why he kept painting the same picture. Was one painting not enough?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, it was not enough! It seemed that if he did not paint, he would be less and less capable of painting the person he remembered. He was afraid that his memory would gradually turn blurry and when the time came, he would not be able to find her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it Grace? It must be her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he first saw her, he already thought that she looked so much like what the girl in his memory would grow up to look like. It was just that too many factors clouded his judgment later on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today, when he saw Grace wearing a floral dress that was similar to the one in his memory, a voice in his mind rang. 'It's her. It must be her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the only one who had ever affected his mood. Only she would make him want to hold her in his arms and only she would make him regret giving her up to Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I'll find proof that you're her. Then... I wish you&rsquo;ll tell me why you deny ever saving me. Is this matter really that trivial to you?" Brian muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand that was holding the paintbrush tightened, and with a snap, the brush was broken into two in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wood scraps from the broken paintbrush pierced Brian's palms, but he seemed to feel no pain as he kept his eyes focused on the face of the little girl in the painting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a life-changing event for him, but what did it mean to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn had become a joke to many people these days. After all, she was kicked off the throne of being the crown prince's girlfriend, all her TV series and commercials were canceled, and she needed to pay contract penalties because of her scandal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She resorted to selling all the jewelry and houses she got from Brian so that she could afford to pay the penalties. She was completely broke now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not bear the thought of leaving Emerald City and living penniless in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially when she was used to living a luxurious life. How could she go back to living such a miserable life? Over the past few days, she had visited directors, producers, and big-name actors she knew to find a way out. She wanted to see if she could turn things around, but she only ended up getting ridiculed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Evelyn's phone rang. She looked at it and found that it was a director she knew from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she answered the call, she only heard the director telling her to go to a hotel in Emerald City.</p></div>
