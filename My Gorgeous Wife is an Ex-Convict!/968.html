        <h1>Chapter 967</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A lot of times, they still would not get paid even if they won.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At noon, Chase Harper called Grace and asked her, "Um... Do you know where the actress Elise Dean is? I... I want to see her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What seems to be the problem?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just want to talk to her about Baldwin. Maybe she'll feel sorry for Baldwin. I&rsquo;m not expecting her to admit that she was the driver, but maybe she&rsquo;ll give Baldwin's family some money so that he can continue to get better treatment," said Chase Harper. He just wanted to make one last effort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Baldwin was also an employee of his company. However, the company was in its start-up stage and there was very little they could do to help Baldwin's family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the company had donated money to Baldwin's family several times, it was still not enough in the face of the huge medical bills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Elise Dean was a famous actress. Some time ago, it was reported that the actress bought a new house worth 60 million dollars, so she should be able to pay for Baldwin's current medical expenses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated. They did not have enough evidence so far. Even if the trial was held, there was no way for the judge to decide that Elise Dean was the real culprit. Maybe they could only hope that Elise Dean had some sympathy for Baldwin's suffering if they wanted to help Baldwin out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I'll bring you to her," said Grace. She had been keeping an eye on Elise Dean, so she knew that Elise Dean had been filming at the studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, then I'll drive over and pick you up," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Grace. After putting away the phone, she reorganized the papers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Chase Harper arrived, Grace got into the car and they headed to the film studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Were you... alright that day?" Chase Harper started the conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned for a moment before realizing that he was referring to the day Jason forced his car to stop in the middle of the road. His driver had come to ask her to go to his car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who the hell is that man?" Chase Harper hesitated and asked, "Is he your boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Boyfriend&hellip; Maybe he used to be, but not anymore.' Grace smiled wryly. "No, I don't have a boyfriend right now. I don't plan to get one," she replied lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper kept quiet and said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove to the film studio, and Grace took Chase Harper to Elise Dean's film set.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stepped forward and asked, "Miss Dean, can I have a chat with you?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elise Dean frowned and said impatiently, "You again?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, the trial is starting soon, so I&rsquo;m here to look for you again," said Grace before introducing Chase Harper. "This is Baldwin's colleague. He wants to talk to you about something. Is that alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you have something to say, be quick. I'm filming my scene soon," said Elise Dean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper told her briefly about Baldwin's condition in the hospital. "Miss Dean, Baldwin's family can't afford the medical expenses anymore, but if we don't continue to use imported medicine, it will be more difficult to get Baldwin to wake up. He's only 25 years old. He's still young. Miss Dean, could you help pay Baldwin's medical bills first? When they get the compensation or when the Li family has the money, they'll pay you back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elise Dean's expression sank immediately, "What do you mean? You want me to pay? I wasn't the one who caused the accident. Why should I pay for it?"</p></div>
