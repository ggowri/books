        <h1>Chapter 2715</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" He was shocked that this was her last request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you&rsquo;re refusing to lift your hypnosis now, don&rsquo;t ever consider doing it in the future. Let everything between us vanish," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he lifted the hypnosis on himself&hellip; 20 or 30 years later, they would not be able to recover their lost time even if they were together. He would only have more regrets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would rather he continued... not to love her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla signed her name on the divorce papers as the hour and minute hands struck 12.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she smiled at him. "Martin Weiss, you're really free now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was no longer a burden to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her, but the faint smile seemed to bring a pang of pain to his heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla returned to Emerald City. Grace was shocked to learn that and rushed to the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only saw Mrs. Corbyn sitting in the store when she arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aunt, where&rsquo;s Kyla?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's inside," said Mrs. Corbyn with a touch of sadness on her face. After her daughter got home last night, she found out the results from her daughter. She learned that her daughter had finally signed the divorce papers and ended her marriage with Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go check on her," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn nodded. She knew that her daughter was just pretending to be fine after she returned, but how could she be truly fine? Her daughter had always been forbearing. She would probably endure all her sadness and say nothing for fear of worrying her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be good if Grace could make her confide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked to the back room, only to see Kyla sitting next to the crib. She was looking down at Trista, who was sound asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing Grace's entrance, Kyla looked up. "What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I came to see you." Grace walked forward. "Didn't you say you had a three-month deal with Martin Weiss? It's not even three months yet. Why are you back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled bitterly. "It's better to cut the long suffering short. I was there for more than two months. I figured it out. The longer I stay, the more I&rsquo;ll annoy him. It&rsquo;s better to set him free sooner than later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's voice was calm, but how could Grace not sense the sadness and pain it contained?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you and him..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We have nothing to do with each other anymore. He'll pay child support every month as per the agreement. Besides that, I won't bother him in L City either. If the kids want to see him, he'll get somebody to take them to L City," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure you won't regret it?" She was letting go of someone she loved the most. She would live the rest of her life in regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla muttered, "I... don't know. But I want to do what&rsquo;s best for him. Now that he doesn't love me, there&rsquo;ll be another woman beside him. That woman can make him happy and take good care of him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But if his hypnosis is lifted and he recovers the feelings he once had for you, he&rsquo;ll surely regret it and suffer," said Grace.</p></div>
