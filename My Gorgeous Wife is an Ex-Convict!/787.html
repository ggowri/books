        <h1>Chapter 786</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" She wondered. He did not have to get into this mess at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, in terms of business, the Stephenson family's business had now begun to extend to Emerald City, and it should be the time for them to establish a good relationship with Jason. If he offended Jason, then the development of the Stephenson family's business in Emerald City would become difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you believe me if I said I don&rsquo;t care who I offend?" he asked as he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, Lina felt her mind in a trance, as if something was pouring out of her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What part of what he&rsquo;s saying is true and what part is false?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... now I seem to be tempted to believe him.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Listening to the butler's report, Terrence knew that Lina and Hadwin, who were outside, had left. His expression finally seemed a little better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What a mess it was today! Everyone was joining in the mess!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, one of Terrence's biggest concerns at the moment was his boss, who had been in the kitchen for three whole hours after coming back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was just standing still in front of the half-finished cake, looking at it and making people wonder what he was thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence also did not understand why Young Master Reed, who obviously loved Grace so much, had suddenly broken up with her today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because of... the psychiatrist from before that made the two of them argue?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or is there... something else?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he knew in his heart that whatever the reason was, it was not for him as a subordinate to inquire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Terrence saw his boss, who had been standing still in the kitchen, suddenly lifting his hand. He refilled the pipe with cream, and... continued to pipe the unfinished cake with cream flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What&rsquo;s Young Master Reed&hellip; doing?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence looked on in shock until Jason finished piping the cake and put candles on it one by one... There were a total of 28 candles on the cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He lit the candles!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like he was celebrating someone's birthday!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Young Master Reed lighting the candles for Grace? The question is, didn't they break up? Besides, Grace isn't here either!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Terrence saw Jason blow out the candles before removing them from the cake one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took a small spoon and began to eat the cake, spoonful after spoonful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence could not help saying, "Young Master Reed, this cake has been left at room temperature for a little too long. If you eat it like that, what if you get sick&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. It has been a little long indeed," mumbled Jason before he continued to eat the cake mouthful by mouthful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like some kind of ritual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The rest of Terrence's speech seemed to be stuck in his throat, and he was unable to utter a single word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Time passed little by little, and Jason finally ate the whole cake. "Terrence, tell me. Is there anyone who can control my life or death?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Terrence was stunned, not expecting that his boss would suddenly ask such a thing. "Of course... not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think so too. There can't be," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Therefore, I need to stop missing and thinking about that woman. Just as if I had never loved her.'</p></div>
