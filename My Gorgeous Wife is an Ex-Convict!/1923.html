        <h1>Chapter 1921</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"My... My husband..." When Grace spoke, she found her throat unusually dry, but she did not feel much pain in her neck. It seemed that the anesthesia had not completely worn off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she struggled to speak anyway. Jay was not in her ward, which made her panic. She knew him well enough to know that he would be in her ward if nothing went wrong!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctor hurriedly said, "Mr. Reed is still undergoing surgery. He has two broken ribs and several severe abrasions on his body that need to be treated. It&rsquo;ll take some time. Mrs. Reed, you&rsquo;ve just undergone an operation, so try not to speak. Wait 12 hours before you speak so you won&rsquo;t affect the wound."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hearing this, Grace said nothing more. All she could think about was Jason. 'Did he... break two ribs?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Just how much pain was he enduring earlier?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had no idea about it. He did not say a word when he carried her into the hospital and watched her enter the operating room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace insisted that the doctor put her and Jason in the same VIP ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Jason was done with his operation and wheeled into the ward, Grace only saw that his body was covered with thick gauze. He was still asleep due to anesthesia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace took her phone, and she typed a line of words in the notes app on her phone to ask the doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Doctor, how are his injuries? Is he okay?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&ldquo;He's alright. Besides, Mr. Reed is in good health. Although he broke two ribs, the operation was successful. He just needs to rest,&rdquo; the doctor replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace heaved a long sigh of relief after hearing this. After the doctor and nurses left, Terrence told her about what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Knowing that her best friend was being treated in Municipal Women's Hospital and her baby was safe, Grace felt another weight lifting off her chest. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Lina and her baby are alright. That's great!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll get a nurse to come over later, and..." Terrence paused and looked at Grace hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace then typed on her phone again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Just say anything you want, Terrence.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence then said, "Young master Reed is still angry with you, Young Madam. But he has always been devoted to you. I&rsquo;ve never seen a man do so much for a woman! After learning that you were in trouble, Young master Reed came to save you even though he was angry with you. Since Young master Reed saved you, please be kind to him. Don't break his heart again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's nose felt sore. 'How many times... have I hurt Jay that Terrence couldn't help telling me this?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She typed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;I won't hurt him anymore. After he wakes up, even if he's still mad at me and won't forgive me, I&rsquo;ll stay by his side until he forgives me.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's good," said Terrence. 'How could Young master Reed not forgive Young Madam? Young master Reed was so quick to surrender when something happened to her.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence was still shocked by the scene when Young master Reed took off his clothes in public in response to Katherine Jackson's humiliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A proud man like him who had always been high and mighty while overlooking others went so far for a woman.</p></div>
