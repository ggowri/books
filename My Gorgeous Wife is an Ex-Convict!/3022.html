        <h1>Chapter 3020</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Last night was so wonderful for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Last night, he took advantage of her vulnerability to some extent. He knew she was drunk, and although some of his actions may have been impulsive, he still allowed himself to act on them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He is usually a very rational person, but now he finds that she seems to be quietly destroying his rationality without him realizing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It wasn't a tumultuous wave that swept through his life, but rather a gentle and subtle presence that entered his world. Before he knew it, he couldn't imagine life without her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda..." Brian murmured, as if the scent of her still lingered on his pillow, making him crave for more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda emerged from the bathroom, she only saw Brian getting dressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You...you woke up?" She was a bit embarrassed, stuttering as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mhmm," Brian responded, "And how about you? How's your body feeling? Are you experiencing any discomfort?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as he said this, her face turned even redder. "There's nothing uncomfortable, everything's fine...," she quickly replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her crimson cheeks and pondered for a moment before saying, "Last night, it was my fault."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's not that... It's not something you should do, but I'm taking the blame. It's my fault, I shouldn't have bullied you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as these words were spoken, Valda wanted to bite her own tongue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Oh my goodness, what is she even saying? But clearly, her words have amused him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian suddenly realized, "So this is how you saw last night. Do you think that I was the one who bullied you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was full of embarrassment, "Probably...I guess so."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's something I'm willing to be bullied by you," Brian said, hesitated for a moment, and added, "But there's something I shouldn't have done. Last night... I forgot to take precautions, so you need to take emergency contraception. I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Emergency contraception, although it doesn't have any significant negative effects on the body if taken occasionally, he would prefer not to rely on her taking the pill to prevent pregnancy if possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just last night, he was so immersed in being with her that he forgot about this matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No...you don't need to apologize. Yesterday, it was my initiative, and also..." Valda paused, as if she had made up her mind, "If this time, there really is a child, then...I want to give birth to it. Is that okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her in shock. Does she know what she's saying right now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you...want to give birth?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mhmm," she nodded, "if there is one, I... want to give birth to it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once, when she thought she might be pregnant, she believed that having an abortion would be the responsible thing to do for that life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now, her thoughts have changed from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you ever thought about what it means to give birth?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She nodded, "It means I'll be a mother and you'll be a father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And it also means we have to get married!" Brian added. "Valda, will you marry me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him seriously and nodded, "I will."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even though I haven't..." he trailed off, finding it hard to say the words in this situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But she finished his sentence for him, "Even though you haven't fallen in love with me yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled and said, "Because I believe you will fall in love with me in the future, so...I might as well exercise my right now."</p></div>
