        <h1>Chapter 718</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just happened to meet him. Then, I almost fell, so I grabbed his hand by accident. After that, I had another headache..." she tried to explain to him what had happened, lest he would misunderstand her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Were those things you said to him really nonsense?" he asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned. Her voice seemed to be stuck in her throat, and she could not get the words out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Nonsense? It wasn&rsquo;t nonsense. It was what the little girl said to the little boy in my dreams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, how am I supposed to answer that question?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I don't want to lie to him, but I don't want him to misunderstand the situation before I find out the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, is that a hard question to answer?" Her silence made him raise his head slightly. His dark bright eyes just stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... Was so dazed by the pain that I can&rsquo;t even remember what I said," said Grace. This was true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the rest, she might have to wait until she found out the truth before she could give him an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" he muttered as he continued to rub her bruises. "However, your hand gripped his so tightly just now, even with the headache."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was just an unconscious grip because I was about to fall, so it was like grasping a lifeline..." she explained eagerly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the more she explained, the more his face darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When did Brian become your lifeline?" he asked. When she uttered the word &lsquo;lifeline&rsquo;, panic had crept into his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The image of her gripping Brian's hand flashed before his eyes again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, he felt as if he was unnecessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I had never met her, would she be standing beside Brian now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even though she has forgotten her past with Brian and the promise they made when they were little, was it her instincts that made her grasp Brian like that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, that's not what I meant&ndash;" Grace was eager to explain that she had used the wrong word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could finish, Jason lowered his head and forcibly kissed her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um..." Instinctively, she opened her mouth to continue her explanation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the tip of his tongue came into her mouth with a passionate, lingering kiss as if to suppress all his fears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace, please don't remember what you've forgotten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't think of Brian as a lifeline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't even get involved with Brian!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss was so domineering that it almost choked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah... Jay..." She turned away, wanting him to stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was not his usual self, and they were in the car now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver was driving at the front!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, every time she turned her head away, his fingers would grab her jaw and forced her to continue to accept his kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know how long the kiss lasted, but the car eventually stopped. Then, the door opened and he carried her out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then did she find out that they had returned to Reed Residence.</p></div>
