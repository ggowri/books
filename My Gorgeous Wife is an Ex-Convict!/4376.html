        <h1>Chapter 4374 In a Hurry to Leave?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell looked at Harley as he pushed the door open and walked in: "Ah, you're here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley stepped forward, "Sorry for the trouble I've caused you. I'll just grab the photo and leave."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you in a hurry?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" She didn't catch on immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you in such a rush?" he asked. "Don't you even have time to sit down and have a cup of coffee with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's not like that," she denied. It was just that he hadn't seemed to like her clinging to him in the past, so she had thought it would be best to just take the photo and leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since that's not the case, why don't you stay and have a cup of coffee with me? The coffee here is pretty good," he suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley hesitated for a moment, then sat down across from Lornell and ordered a latte.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the waiter brought over the coffee. The aroma of the coffee made Harley feel more relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought for a moment, realizing it had been quite a while since she last had coffee with Lornell like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when she was still his </span><span>fianc</span><span>&eacute;e, she always dreamed of sitting down with him for a cup of coffee, knowing how much he loved it. But who would have thought, it was only after they broke off their engagement that he took the initiative to invite her for coffee for the first time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, how did you end up going to the amusement park with that guy named Calvert?" Lornell asked, pretending to be casual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That day happened to be Calvert's birthday, so I went with him to the amusement park," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Did he ask you to go with him?" Lornell asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley raised an eyebrow curiously, "Why are you suddenly interested in him?" After all, Lornell wasn't someone who typically showed curiosity about others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Harley's view, the only thing that would pique Lornell's curiosity was anything related to medicine. As for other people and things, Lornell had always been quite indifferent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, he actually asked in detail about Calvert's situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You say you're just friends with him, but is that really what he thinks? And, those photos of you two, was it really just a coincidence? Or did he anticipate that you might be photographed, so he deliberately asked you to accompany him to the amusement park, hoping to create a scandalous rumor that would benefit him?" Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley frowned, "He's not that kind of person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really trust him that much?" Lornell said, clearly displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's my friend, of course I believe him!" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell scoffed, "You believe him? Do you think a low-level nobody, desperate to climb up, wouldn't resort to any kind of scheming or tactics? I thought after all these years, you'd have developed some caution."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thanks for your concern, but I know what I need to do," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's thin lips were pressed into a straight line.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I have the photo now?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Lornell said, pulling out a photo and handing it to Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley took the photos and flipped through them. They were pretty well taken, and indeed, they looked somewhat ambiguous, as if she and Calvert were truly a young couple.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If these photos were to be released, they could indeed cause misunderstandings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you." She said, preparing to get up and leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait a minute, you just got here. You haven't even had a sip of your coffee. Are you really in such a hurry to leave?" Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley lifted his coffee cup and took a sip, "The coffee here is indeed very good. I have some things to take care of, so I'll be leaving now. Next time when there's a chance, we'll..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish her sentence, Lornell suddenly said, "It seems like they're shooting an advertisement across the street today. Speaking of which, you should be quite familiar with the model they're using!"</span></p></div>
