        <h1>Chapter 4022</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if it was just a little bit of force, she might not be able to bear it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially when he loses control of his emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had made a promise to himself that he would never hurt her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he was the one causing her pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lost control?!" Jasper was startled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason looked at his son thoughtfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace worriedly asked, "Nancy still refuses to have an abortion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And this silence made everyone understand Nancy's decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, you need to go and adjust your emotions. Your current state is not suitable for staying in her hospital room," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick pursed his lips, took one last deep look at Nancy, and then left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace expressed her concern, "What about Mick..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll find a psychologist for him to see," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Given his current state, it's likely that Mick has some psychological issues. Although Mason appears more paranoid than Mick on a daily basis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick is smoother in his interactions with people than Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as a father, he naturally understands that his eldest son may become more stubborn than his second son once he becomes paranoid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like I've been emotionally blocked for a long time, but now that I've met Nancy, all my emotions finally have an outlet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If this paranoia continues to escalate, it may not be good for either of them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace nodded in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She also noticed that her eldest son's emotions were clearly off earlier!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is everything okay with my big brother?" Jasper asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He'll be fine. Don't forget, he's your big brother!" Jason reassured her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper breathed a sigh of relief. Yes, she should have faith in her big brother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Nancy woke up again, Jasper was sitting by her bedside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're awake? How do you feel? Are you still in pain?" Jasper asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked at Jasper in confusion. "What happened to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't you remember? My big brother grabbed your shoulder and you passed out from the pain," Jasper reminded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy suddenly remembered that she had fainted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about Mick?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her mind, she recalled the way Mick had grabbed her shoulder, his eyes turning terrifyingly red. Even though she cried out in pain and begged him to let go, he seemed not to hear her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My brother was a bit out of control emotionally before, so my father asked him not to come into your hospital room for now, so as not to lose control and hurt you again," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy lowered her eyes gently. "Is he okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe the pressure is too much," Jasper said. "During this time, my brother slept only 2-3 hours a day in order to find you. As long as there was any news about you, he would rush over to verify it immediately. His nerves have been tense. He cares too much about your life and death. Now that he has finally found you, he knows that if you insist on having a child, there will be a risk to your life, so he..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper didn't say anything more, but Nancy already understood what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, my brother didn't mean to hurt you on purpose. He's just too afraid that something will happen to you again," Jasper pleaded for his older brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was afraid that Nancy would hate his older brother because of this.</p></div>
