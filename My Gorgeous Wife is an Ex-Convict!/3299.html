        <h1>Chapter 3297</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Wilona came out to close the door. When she saw Jasper standing at the door, she was surprised for a moment, then exaggeratedly greeted him, saying, "Jasper, what brings you here? Come on in and have a seat." She then turned around and shouted into the house, "Lawrence, Jasper is here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at the enthusiasm on Wilona's face. Before, she wouldn't have thought much of it, but now she felt it was insincere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence's mother's enthusiasm is just a ploy to take advantage of the Reed family! She's only after their money!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence quickly walked out of the room and when he saw Jasper, his eyes widened and they seemed to light up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, when Jasper saw Lawrence, he thought she would be very happy, but now she just can't seem to be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can I speak with Lawrence outside for a few moments?" Jasper asked Wilona.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah, why stay outside? Come inside," Wilona warmly invited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper insisted, "It's just outside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona wanted to say more, but when she looked into Jasper's almond-shaped eyes, the words seemed to get stuck in her throat. Even though he was still a child, he gave her an inexplicable feeling of unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well...let's talk outside then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just want to talk to Lawrence alone," Jasper said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Wilona didn't want to argue, so she didn't object when the driver who was with Jasper approached her and said, "You should go inside the house first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona went inside the house while the driver stood by the door. Jasper then spoke to Lawrence, "Are you being nice to me and treating me like a friend just to please me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Lawrence was taken aback, staring blankly at Jasper, opening his mouth to say something but unable to find the words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His silence confirmed her suspicions even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I heard it all. Earlier, I saw someone leaving your house. They said that your family is using me and my family to cheat people out of their money. Your mother even said that if you please me, your family will become wealthy," said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, every word she spoke made Lawrence's body shrink even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even he slowly lowered his head and dared not look at her because he didn't know how to face her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These days, he has been living in fear. He knows that his mom did something wrong, and his piano class clashes with Jasper's schedule, which makes him scared and worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I'm afraid I won't be able to learn piano with Jasper anymore in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But his parents kept talking about how to please Jasper, how to make the Reed family like him more, and how to gain more benefits from them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't want to do it, but his mother's words made him even more anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you don't properly please Jasper, then in the future, you may not even get to see Jasper's face!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted to see her, but didn't want to do as his mother said. So, he promised his parents that he would try his best to please Jasper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he didn't expect to be asked by Jasper in this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't want to lie to her, but he couldn't bring himself to tell the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only thing he could say was "I'm sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just this one apology, however, made Jasper's face full of disappointment. "Then you don't need to try to please me anymore, because from now on, we are no longer friends!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she finished speaking, she turned to the driver and said, "Uncle Zack, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the moment she turned around, his hand suddenly grabbed her wrist.</p></div>
