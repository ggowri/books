        <h1>Chapter 2263</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman got out of the car. Kyla was sitting in the backseat as Jacqueline Bowman had put some extra candles and incense sticks on the front passenger seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doors were closed, and the car keys were in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla sat inside. For some reason, she began to feel as if the smell in the car was getting stronger and stronger. It smelled like the fragrance that came from the amulet, and she started <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>to get drowsy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she knew it, her eyelids slowly closed and she fell sound asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, two men walked to the car and casually opened the door. They got into the car and drove away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time Jacqueline Bowman came out of the temple, her car had disappeared from where she parked it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was immediately anxious and went to the temple to ask around. Moments later, she called the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello? My car is gone and my friend is in the car. I can't reach my friend's phone either. Could you help me look for it? It went missing at..." Jacqueline Bowman anxiously reported the incident to the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the call was over, she looked down and seemed to wait impatiently. However, there was a slight smirk on the corners of her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since Kyla refused to help her, she should not blame her for harming her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was shocked when he received Mrs. Corbyn's phone call. "What? Kyla is missing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Kyla went to pray with her friend. She fell asleep when she was left alone in the car and the keys happened to be inside. Two car thieves got in and drove the car away. They haven't found the car or Kyla." Mrs. Corbyn choked up as she told him what the police told her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought her daughter was just going to offer incense and pray. She did not expect this to happen to her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn regretted asking her daughter to go to the temple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla's friend has reported it to the police, but the police won&rsquo;t be able to find her so soon. Martin, could you... Could you try and see if there's any other way to find her?" Mrs. Corbyn said anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Which police station is handling this case?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn gave the address of the police station, and Martin Weiss said, "I'll go over right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he hurried out of the office and went straight to the underground garage. He quickly drove toward the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All he could think of was Kyla, and he prayed that nothing had happened to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss reached the police station, he saw Mrs. Corbyn sitting on a chair, constantly wiping her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn cried harder at the sight of Martin Weiss. "Martin, what do we do? Kyla's pregnant. Will those car thieves hurt her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss gently patted Mrs. Corbyn's shoulder. "Mom, don't worry. I'll find Kyla as soon as possible! Which friend did she go to the temple with?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Her friend's name is Jacqueline Bowman. The police is taking her statement right now," said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned when he heard that. He disliked that woman&hellip; Jacqueline Bowman.</p></div>
