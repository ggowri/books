        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadwin stared at his daughter. "Are you serious?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm serious." Tina said, "I've realized that I still love Chandler. Even without my memories, I still have those feelings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instead of being surprised like her husband, Lina looked at her daughter as if she had expected this. "What about Chandler? What does he say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina smiled bitterly. "He doesn't believe that I love him. He just thinks it's sympathy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina sighed. "He's probably scared. He experienced the feeling of gaining and losing once before, so he's afraid of going through it again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina pursed her lips. Now, she regretted why she had insisted on divorcing Chandler so resolutely. If she could have just held off and stayed calm, maybe the situation wouldn't be so bad now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But on the other hand, she vaguely understood that at that time, she was so angry and eager to divorce him because she loved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> she found his betrayal unbearable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you plan to do in the future?" Hadwin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll probably... keep pursuing him. With time, he will eventually believe that I truly love him," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The best way would be to regain her memories. Once her memories were restored, Chandler would probably believe that she loved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But memories weren't something that could be restored so easily!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Tina went to find Chandler again, she was informed that Chandler had returned to the Hunter family mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Tina was stunned. "He went back to the Hunter family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, if Miss Stephenson has any message to convey, I can help pass it on," Chandler's secretary said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need!" Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He suddenly went back to the Hunter family, could it be to avoid her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But since he can go back to the Hunter family, then she can go find him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina immediately packed her things and headed to the Hunter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning about her daughter's plan, Lina originally wanted to go with her, but Hadwin held her back. "Let her go alone. Since she and Chandler haven't divorced, they are still husband and wife. This is their private matter. It's not good for us to interfere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Lina still had some concerns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The driver will follow her. If anything happens, the driver will report it. Moreover, even though the Hunter family may not be happy with Tina, she hasn't actually divorced Chandler. They wouldn't make things too difficult for him," Hadwin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina finally agreed to let her daughter go on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Tina arrived at the entrance of the Hunter family, she was stopped by the people from the Hunter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The old Mr. Hunter said, please leave, Miss Stephenson. Your current identity is not suitable for entering the Hunter family estate," the person in front of Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina stared at the person in front of her. It seemed that the people from the Hunter family really didn't like her anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However</span><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shouldn't you be calling me Ms. Hunter? I am still the daughter-in-law of the Hunter family. Since when does the Hunter family not allow their daughter-in-law to enter? Is this the rule of the Hunter family?" Tina said loudly while taking out a document from her pocket!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the marriage certificate!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the Hunter family security guards who were blocking Tina looked at each other in shock.</span></p></div>
