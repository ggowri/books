        <h1>Chapter 1671</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Li Peiyuan's expression turned grim, and her colleague at the side hurriedly smoothed things over by saying, "Alright, Miss Cummins, we're done questioning you today. You can go home now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace got up and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The colleague looked at Li Peiyuan and said, "What came over you? Your question was indeed out of line. We must be objective instead of making presumptions."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Li Peiyuan snapped. "She just has nothing to fear because she's Jason's wife!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"As you said, she's Jason's wife. Do you think Jason will let her off easily if she does have something going on with her mentor? Will she still be able to be fearless?" they asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Li Peiyuan was instantly speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as Grace emerged from the procuratorate, she was mobbed by reporters who asked questions about various speculation regarding Grace and her mentor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Several bodyguards beside Grace kept the reporters at bay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Cummins, you quickly went from an unknown lawyer to someone who was in demand in L City. Did you reach a deal with Old Lawyer Watts to exchange fame for sex? Someone said your daughter, Jasper Reed, is actually Old Lawyer Watts's illegitimate daughter. Is it true?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A reporter suddenly asked out loud. Grace immediately stopped dead in her tracks and turned to look sharply at the reporter." Apologize!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What?" The reporter paused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Saying such things without any facts is equivalent to spreading rumors. Shouldn't you apologize? I want you to apologize to me, my mentor, and my daughter!" Grace said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The reporter got excited. "If you think what I said is wrong, tell us the truth and deny the rumor yourself! Otherwise, it just means you and Lawyer Kang Milo have something to hide. Your daughter is probably Lawyer Kang's illegitimate daughter!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With a cold gaze, Grace raised her hand to slap them in the face but a hand suddenly grabbed hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was momentarily stunned. The person who grabbed her hand was Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, what are you doing here?" she asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I came to pick you up, but it seems I came just in time," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The reporter was instantly smug when he saw that Jason had come. He even grabbed Grace's hand when she wanted to hit him. "Mr. Reed, you must be dying to know the relationship between your wife and her mentor, as well as whether that daughter of hers is yours or Lawyer&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before he could finish speaking, Jason raised his foot and kicked the reporter to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said nonchalantly, "Sorry, my legs are too long. I didn't hear you just now. Repeat what you said."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Though he said so, Jason did not lift his foot off the reporter. Jason&rsquo;s dark eyes peered down at him with an indifference that terrified the reporter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A sudden fear swept over him. He could even sense that he might not be able to get up from the ground if he repeated his words.</p></div>
