        <h1>Chapter 3028</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The feeling of loneliness was so strong back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you looking at?" Brian's voice interrupted her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda turned her head towards Brian and said, "Look, across the street, there's a child squatting. I've been watching for a while now, and it seems like there's no parent around. Maybe the child doesn't want to go home after school?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She noticed that there was a schoolbag placed beside the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, Brian looked across the street for a moment. However, soon after, his eyebrows furrowed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That child is Simon Gregory," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know each other?" Valda asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just caught a glimpse of the child. He is Amber and George's child," said Brian, while also wondering why the Gregory family would allow a child to be left on the roadside like this. From what he could see, there were no bodyguards or nannies around the child either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked shocked. She had only heard Amber's story on the plane, and now she realized that the little boy she had been paying attention to for quite some time was actually Amber's child?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pursed his lips and stood up, saying, "I'll go get the child to prevent any accidents."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian got up and walked towards Simon, but before he could reach him, Valda noticed a middle-aged woman approaching Simon and taking the child's hand, as if she wanted to take the child away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simon was struggling continuously, clearly not wanting to follow the other person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was taken aback, then she saw Brian walking forward and engaging in a conversation with the middle-aged woman. The woman had her arms crossed and was pointing at Brian while shouting at the top of her lungs. A crowd had started to gather around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon seeing this, Valda quickly stood up and rushed out of the restaurant, running towards the other side of the street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda hadn't even reached Brian when she heard the middle-aged woman shouting, "You, sir, dress so nicely, but why do you have to be so troublesome? I'm taking my own child home, do I need your permission?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure he is your child?" Brian said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can you be uncertain? He is my biological son, born to me and my husband. Do I need to tell you that I gave birth to my own child?" the other person said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, you're not my mom!" said Simon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You, child, how can you say such things? Just because your mother doesn't allow you to play games and wants you to focus on your studies, you don't recognize her? Do you know how hard your mother works every day to ensure you have a good life?" The woman began to cry with tears in her eyes, appearing genuinely emotional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The surrounding onlookers, obviously swayed by the woman's words, gradually began to side with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people also say, "Child, you should go back with your mother quickly. Your mother is working so hard, isn't it all for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, kids these days just love playing games. When they start playing, it's like they become a different person. That's how it is with my child too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know, when my child plays games, they even secretly use my phone to make in-game purchases. And when I caught them, they wouldn't admit it! They can lie without batting an eye."</p></div>
