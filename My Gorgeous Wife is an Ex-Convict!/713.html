        <h1>Chapter 712</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Martin Weiss probably did not want this son at all, Kyla could not take any risks lest Nelson was taken away from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I quite like that kid," said Martin Weiss. There was a smile on his normally serious face. "I was wondering if I could see that boy again with my visit to Emerald City this time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He wants to see Nelson?' Grace suddenly found her nose a little sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was the man who made Kyla so miserable and left Nelson without a father at birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While he was living a life of luxury with people at his beck and call, Kyla had struggled in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now he said he wanted to meet Nelson&mdash;The son he did not even know existed. It was greatly ironic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." Grace rejected almost subconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she had refused too fast and too firmly, Martin Weiss was a little stunned. There was a hint of confusion in his narrow and deep eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins, if you find it troublesome, you can give me his contact information. I'll go and visit him myself. I'd like to buy that child some toys. I quite like him. If possible, I'd like to fund him and provide him with better treatment," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, it was strange that he would often think about the deaf child. He even felt that it was such a shame that a beautiful child like him could not hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow, he wanted to help the child and give him better treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a feeling he had never experienced before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As his friends had put it, it was because he did not have any children of his own, so... That was why he was feeling this strange affection toward an unfamiliar child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he had children of his own, it would only be natural that his affection fell on them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, my fianc&eacute; and I will provide Nelson with good medical care. Nelson's family doesn&rsquo;t want to be disturbed, so I'll thank you for your kindness on their behalf. However, I cannot provide any contact information," Grace replied coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes could not help but darken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time Grace and Jason left, Jewel Bailey looked at the man she had worked with. Having previously served as legal adviser for Weiss Group, the two became acquainted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she knew what kind of man Martin Weiss was. He was cold, cruel, and never showed mercy to anyone he wanted to deal with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if it was someone he was once affectionate with, once he wanted to abandon them, he would never show mercy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was unusual for such a man to show such kindness to a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was even rarer where his kindness was rejected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's rare to see you get rejected. Do you really like that kid?" asked Jewel Bailey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pressed his thin lips together tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rather than liking him, it was more like he kept seeing traces of that woman in the child, but upon closer inspection, the child was not so much like the woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At best, it was the way they smiled that they were similar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had sent so many people to look for that woman, but it was to no avail!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That woman always liked to smile at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the end, she had cried in front of him. Her tears kept falling from her eyes while she said in a solemn voice, "Martin Weiss, from now on, you and I are really done. Even in hell, we&rsquo;d never meet again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she did not want to see him again no matter if it was life or death?</p></div>
