        <h1>Chapter 4249 Leaving</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Tina didn't give Kit any response and left the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't agree, nor did she refuse. Because she didn't know what answer would be right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Kit encountered danger again, would she go save him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she definitely wouldn't do it in such a foolish way again, at least not without protecting herself first!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back at the Stephenson family, Lina immediately approached her daughter and asked, "How is Kit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He should be fine," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about you? How are you?" Lina asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, I'm not injured either. Chandler came just in time and saved me and Kit," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina hesitated for a moment and asked, "Did Chandler say anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina lowered her gaze. "He didn't say anything, but he accompanied me to take Kit to the hospital and helped with his admission procedures, then he left first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina sighed and suddenly held her daughter's hand. "What are you really thinking, Tina?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Tina was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like Kit?" Lina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was stunned for a moment and then replied honestly, "I don't, I just couldn't bear to see him being beaten up like that because Kit once saved me. Besides, those people were in the wrong, Kit is innocent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, does Chandler believe what you said?" Lina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina touched her daughter's head. "Tina, tell Mom, do you like Chandler? Even though Mom knows you don't have any past memories, based on your current understanding and interaction with Chandler, do you like him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina pursed her lips and honestly said, "I think I do like him, maybe it's not love yet, but I think I like him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The time she spent with Chandler made her feel comfortable and at ease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even just sitting together, not saying anything, there wouldn't be that awkward feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you like him, don't let Chandler misunderstand," Lina said. "Don't let unnecessary misunderstandings affect your feelings for each other. You may not remember everything from the past, but those past emotions still have an influence on you. Just like how you quickly came to like Chandler now, I think it's because deep down, you still have feelings for Chandler."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pausing for a moment, Lina continued, "Mom isn't forcing you to fall in love with Chandler again, even though I've always thought that child Chandler is great. But your life is yours to grasp, Mom just doesn't want you to regret it because of today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina quietly listened to her mother's words, and the last image that came to her mind was Chandler's departing figure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would Chandler misunderstand?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Misunderstand her feelings for Kit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, her chest suddenly felt heavy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I understand. I'll go find him tomorrow and explain everything. Even if he misunderstands something, I'll clarify it," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hearing this, Lina smiled and said, "Good!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next day, when Tina went to find Chandler, she was told that Chandler had already left Emerald City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when Tina called Chandler, it showed that his phone was turned off!</span></p></div>
