Of course, the leader said this in a rather subtle way. When saying this, the leader made it clear to Veronica that it is necessary to make Daniel withdraw the lawsuit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Daniel really sues, even if he loses in the end, he is still an employee of our company. This means that the company has offended the Reed family. You must know what kind of existence the Reed family is in Emerald City." The leader spoke frankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reason why the leader sent Veronica first was nothing more than to let her persuade Daniel and find out his attitude. If Veronica can persuade him, it would be great. If not, then the company's top management will directly go to Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica accepted the task and had no intention of refusing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Firstly, she wanted to see how Daniel's injuries were, because the severity of his injuries would directly affect the responsibility that Mason might have to bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Secondly, if she could really persuade Daniel to withdraw the lawsuit, it would be the best outcome. However, based on her current understanding of Daniel, this is probably difficult to achieve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Veronica arrived at the hospital, Daniel was resting in the ward. His hair was shaved off in the area where he was injured, and he was wearing a hospital gown. Other than that, he looked normal and his complexion was good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Daniel saw her, he didn't seem too surprised, but rather looked like he had expected her to come.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, are you here to plead for Mason? Asking me not to sue him?" Daniel sneered at Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here because the company's leader asked me to come. The leader hopes that you can withdraw the lawsuit," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, it's good to have money and power! Mason was clearly in the wrong, but now I have to withdraw the lawsuit," Daniel said disdainfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were originally in the wrong. If you hadn't taken me to the hospital against my will, nothing would have happened," Veronica said. "His behavior was stimulated by your behavior. If you don't withdraw the lawsuit, then I will also exercise my right and hand over all the call records of when you forced me to go to the hospital to the police."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's face twisted, "Sure enough, you are also someone who favors the rich and despises the poor. Do you think that by doing this, you can become the second young lady of the Reed family in the future? Let me tell you, you won't have a good ending either. Mason abandoned you and went abroad back then. Who knows if he will abandon you in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt bitter in her heart. It's not a matter of who knows what will happen in the future, but rather that Mason has already abandoned her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, it's not so much that he abandoned her, as it is that Mason has already given up on their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I don't have a good outcome, it's none of your business, Daniel. I've said my piece, so think carefully about whether or not you want to drop the lawsuit," Veronica said, turning to leave the hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" Daniel called out, "Veronica, are you really going to be with Mason? You saw </span><span>how he hit me, like a crazy person. Whenever he's provoked, he acts like a lunatic. Aren't you afraid he'll be violent towards you in the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica paused and turned to face Daniel. "You think he's crazy, but I never see him that way. Daniel, you're living in the past, blaming others for all your mistakes. Is that a meaningful way to live?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica left the hospital room, leaving Daniel glaring at the door as if he were staring at her back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who was she to say such things to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't experience the same setbacks as him. His life was ruined because of Mason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that's the case, he wouldn't let Mason have the last laugh!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p></div>
