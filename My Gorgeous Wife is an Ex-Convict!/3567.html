        <h1>Chapter 3565</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Misunderstanding? Is there any misunderstanding between us?" Roger asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was last time... when we were not very happy in the piano room, I invited you for a cup of milk tea. Let's be friends from now on, okay? Didn't you also say before that you want to be friends with me?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, you want to be friends with me just because of my face?" he asked back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She smiled awkwardly, "Um... even if you don't look like this, I still want to be friends with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh? Why is that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because... because you play the piano so well, I like your music," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes flickered, is it because of this reason again? Does she want to be friends with anyone who plays the piano well?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let's go." He said, taking the initiative to step towards the school gate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you willing?" She hurriedly caught up and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why not? Miss. Reed wants to be friends with me, I have no reason to refuse!" He said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She bit her lip slightly, "Don't call me Miss. Reed, you can call me by my name." Being called Miss. Reed all the time feels like a kind of mockery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So can I call you Jasper?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the word Jasper came out of his mouth, it suddenly made her heart tremble, with a strange feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...sure!" she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them walked out of the campus and came to the nearby milk tea shop. There were already many students lining up at the door. After all, this milk tea shop was also a popular spot nearby, and business was usually quite good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What flavor do you want to drink?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whatever." He said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait here, I'll go queue up to buy it." She said eagerly, and then stood in the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He just stood by and watched her queue up, then ordered two cups of milk tea at the cashier, and rushed to the pick-up counter to wait for the milk tea, busy and bustling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, in his eyes, she usually only had the role of being served by others, but now, she was queuing up to buy milk tea, and even buying it for him, but he didn't seem to feel happy about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is it because buying milk tea is ultimately just a small matter?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Jasper finally bought two cups of milk tea and walked up to Roger. "Here, I picked a cup of vanilla flavor for you. I think this flavor will be more refreshing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took the milk tea but didn't drink it. He just looked at her smiling face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Don't you like it?" She asked, with a hint of anxiety in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No rush," he said. In fact, he wasn't interested in the milk tea at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you don't like this flavor, I can get you another one," she became more anxious. After all, her goal today was to get him to drink from the straw she had prepared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If he doesn't drink, how can I use the straw on her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her anxiety made him slightly suspicious. "Do you really want me to drink the milk tea?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well...of course I want to share good things with my friends," she said, slightly embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her expression and then turned to walk in the other direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, where are you going?" She hurried to catch up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go to the bookstore and buy some reference books," he said.</p></div>
