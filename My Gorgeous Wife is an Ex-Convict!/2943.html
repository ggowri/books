        <h1>Chapter 2941</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse hurried over and was taken aback upon seeing the two embracing figures in the hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment, she regained her composure and said, "You rang the nurse's bell earlier...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller struggled to explain, "He seems to have a fever, could you please check on him?" But Brian Hart still clung tightly to her, refusing to let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian Hart, please let go and let the nurse take your temperature," Valda Theller urged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't jump, don't... I don't want you to leave me... Valda Theller, don't jump..." he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, okay, I won't jump, I won't leave you," she replied, unsure of what was happening but going along with his words. "Now, please let go so the nurse can check your temperature and see how you're doing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, her words seemed to have an effect and he slowly released his grip. Valda Theller breathed a sigh of relief as the nurse took his temperature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"39.5 degrees," she confirmed. He was definitely running a fever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse contacted the doctor and Brian Hart's hand remained clasped in Valda Theller's, his eyes half-open and unfocused as he continued to murmur, "Don't jump... Valda Theller, don't jump..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Soon, the doctor arrived and Valda Theller asked anxiously, "Doctor, what's wrong with him? He's been talking nonsense and seemed to have been having nightmares earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's likely due to the fever and previous nightmares, causing him to be disoriented and possibly thinking he's still in a dream. But don't worry, it's just a temporary phenomenon," the doctor reassured her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller breathed a small sigh of relief as the doctor conducted a preliminary examination and administered a fever-reducing injection and two bags of saline solution. Because Brian Hart's left hand was still tightly holding hers, the nurse had to insert the needle into the back of his right hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tomorrow, if the fever subsides, there shouldn't be any problems. But if it doesn't, we may need to conduct further tests. Tonight, the nurse will check his temperature every two hours," the doctor informed them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," Valda Theller replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they were left alone in the room, Brian Hart's eyes slowly closed again, but his hand remained clasped in hers and he continued to murmur her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller wondered what he had dreamt about and what she had done to make him so afraid that he clung to her so tightly, trembling. This man clearly had feelings for her, and she believed he genuinely liked her. Otherwise, why would he have risked his life to protect her and called out her name in his dreams?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would she be able to let go of his hand?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her gaze fell on their intertwined hands, and she couldn't predict what the future held. Perhaps she wouldn't become ugly with jealousy, perhaps he had already fallen in love with her before she became jealous, perhaps even if he didn't love her in the end, they could still end things gracefully...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So many maybes floated through her mind, but only she could provide the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">---</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart's fever finally subsided at 4am, and Valda Theller's heart finally relaxed. Because his hand had been holding hers tightly, she hadn't returned to her own bed to sleep and instead dozed off by his bedside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although her eyes were closed, she slept lightly and woke up immediately when he stirred. She opened her eyes and saw that his phoenix eyes were already open.</p></div>
