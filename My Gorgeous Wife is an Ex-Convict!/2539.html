        <h1>Chapter 2537</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Daley Moss replied to his wife before glancing at Amber Mitchell again. "Why don't you get in the car with us and return to the Moss family&rsquo;s house? I'd like to have another talk with you about what you said the last time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell froze slightly before smiling gently. "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera looked at Amber Mitchell. She wanted to say something but hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they arrived at the Moss family&rsquo;s house, Daley Moss had his servants leave. Hence, only he, his wife, and Amber Mitchell were in the living room. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss asked, "Are you still planning to do what you said last time? Even if you feel indebted to my eldest brother, you don't have to do so."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had once hated this woman, but the hatred had somehow faded after seeing how hard the woman was trying to find the truth of the car accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, the person who caused the accident was the one he should hate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not doing it out of guilt but because I... love Herman," muttered Amber Mitchell, but the words seemed to carry infinite weight. "Just think of it as realizing a wish for him and myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not that old. You have plenty of time to meet someone you can love," said Daley Moss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell smiled bitterly. "Herman loved me the most in this world, and I don't want to love anyone else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Herman had occupied her heart, and there was no room for others!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you've made up your mind, sign this agreement. We can do the rest as you wish," said Daley Moss as he took out an agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell read the agreement and prepared to sign it without any objection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell, are you sure? You're not obligated to do this, but your future husband might find it difficult to accept if you ever want to get married," Whitney Herrera could not help warning her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell smiled faintly. "I have no intention of getting married."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she signed her name on the document!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just wanted to do what she wanted to do most. Life was too short. She had wasted too much time. She wanted to cherish every day she was still alive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After receiving a phone call from Amber Mitchell, Grace knew that Brian might have returned to Emerald City when he heard that her pregnancy this time was slightly tough. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the call was over, Grace bit her lip slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought Brian had let go of his feelings for her after spending some time abroad. However, she understood that he had not let go when they met in Deer City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's going to happen now that he's back in Emerald City?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace kept feeling a vague unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the law firm, she asked the driver to take her to Reed group&rsquo;s building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was uncertain whether Brian had returned to Emerald City. Maybe he did not return at all, but she still decided to tell Jay in case Brian did return to Emerald City because of her. It might cause Jay to misunderstand again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason saw Grace in his office, he raised his eyebrows in surprise. "What are you doing here all of a sudden? Is everything at the law firm settled?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I've settled the matters there," she said. She had been busy with the law firm these days. After all, she had to rest well for her pregnancy, so she had to have someone else handle everything at the firm.</p></div>
