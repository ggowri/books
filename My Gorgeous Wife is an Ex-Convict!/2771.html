        <h1>Chapter 2769</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On her way back, Rhea Oliver snapped at her boyfriend, "Why did you pull me away? That Valda Theller was disgusting back then. So what if I scold her? I even beat her up before, and she accepted it obediently!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That was then, not now," Stewart Watson snapped back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong with now? She's not doing well either. She's not wearing any luxury brands, just cheap clothing. She's just the same as she was back then," Rhea Oliver said in disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you take a closer look at her boyfriend's clothes? The watch her boyfriend is wearing cost tens of millions of dollars!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver's face was instantly full of surprise as soon as Stewart Watson spoke. "That's... impossible. How can Valda Theller's boyfriend afford to wear a watch that cost tens of millions of dollars? Could it be a knock-off?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stewart Watson rolled his eyes. "Do you think I can't tell what's real and fake?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver was rendered speechless. After all, her boyfriend was interested in watches, so he could distinguish between real and fake watches better than ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... But how does Valda Theller's boyfriend have such an expensive watch?" Rhea Oliver's face was still full of disbelief. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stewart Watson's confusion was only... "Who&rsquo;s this boyfriend of hers?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no one could tell them the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Shana Nicholls left the hospital, two men put her in a car and took her to the Weiss family's mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was instantly relieved when she saw Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been uneasy these days, wondering if what she had done would be discovered. Although she got a lot of money for it, she was afraid to spend it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I underestimated you. I didn't expect you to counter like that." Martin Weiss looked at Shana Nicholls coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I don't know what you mean, Mr. Weiss," Shana Nicholls said as she played dumb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You sold my information to the Weiss family's rival. You made good money from it, didn't you?" Martin Weiss said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls immediately understood as soon as he said that. It seemed that Martin Weiss already knew what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What you said is ridiculous, Mr. Weiss. Someone was just concerned about your health and marital status. I happened to know some information and made a passing remark. I didn't do anything other than that. Besides, didn't you always want to divorce Mrs. Weiss, Mr. Weiss? Since Mrs. Weiss has agreed to the divorce, you can get it done and there won't be so many rumors anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss snorted gently. "Another way is to hand you over to the police so you can tell everyone everything you've done. That way, people will understand that someone had a hidden agenda and that it was a retaliation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls's expression changed, and she immediately snapped, "Hand me to the police? They have no reason to arrest me!" She had already assumed that what she leaked was not a secret but a passing remark to the Weiss family's opponent. What she did had not broken any laws.</p></div>
