        <h1>Chapter 518</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I wonder what your relationship is with Jason? Why don't you tell us and satisfy our curiosity?" asked Elsie Jordan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled and said, "That's personal, and I don't think it's convenient to tell you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she said this, the three women suddenly took on a ghastly expression. Tasha Farmer, the daughter of a chairman of a convenience store chain, immediately said, "That's not a very nice thing to say. Is there something shameful in the story that you dare not tell us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face darkened a little. There it was&hellip; Even though she wanted to avoid it, she could not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Felicia Kemp, the granddaughter of a five-star hotel owner, stared at Grace's face with a slight frown. She looked as if she was thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer continued to probe aggressively, "Could it be that you played some tricks to get involved with Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pursed her lips slightly. "Sorry, I've got something to do, so I need to go," she said and tried to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These three women were obviously here to find fault with her. She would only be picked on more if she continued to stay here. The best way was to avoid them. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to avoid them, but they would not let her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer stood in front of her and said, "What are you leaving for? Why don't you answer our question first? There's nothing to hide. If you don't have something to hide, why don't you just tell us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace raised her eyes and looked at the woman in front of her. She knew that today's events might not end well. Since there was no way to avoid them, she just had to face it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Farmer, isn't it? Aren&rsquo;t there rumors going around lately about your family&rsquo;s convenience store chain evading taxes? If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, this matter is being looked into by the tax bureau, am I right? Why don't you tell me what's going on? Are you and your family evading taxes? If it's a misunderstanding, how did it come about? By the way, I've also heard that the tax bureau officer handling this case is related to your family. Why don't you tell us what kind of relationship is it? There's nothing to hide, so you probably won't mind telling us about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s words immediately made Tasha Farmer&rsquo;s face turn pale. After all, the revelation of tax evasion had been the most embarrassing thing for her family these days, and they were trying their best to put those rumors to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today, she had come to the banquet for the purpose of getting help from Elsie Jordan and Felicia Kemp. Their families had many connections with the tax bureau. If they would help, it would be easy for her family to settle the matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that Grace had said so, how could she answer those questions?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who the hell are you to ask me that?" Tasha Farmer glared at Grace, feeling offended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sneered. "Who the hell are you then? I guess you have double standards with your 'nothing to hide'. What law says I have to tell you about myself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." People usually treated Tasha Farmer with honor and respect. When had anyone treated her so badly? She raised her hand to slap Grace, but Grace raised her hand and waved it away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned around. She did not want to stay any longer to avoid this matter from escalating. Just then, Felicia Kemp, who had been silent all along, shouted, "I remember now. You're Sean's ex-girlfriend, aren't you? You killed Jason's fianc&eacute;e, Jennifer Atkinson, in an accident..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Felicia Kemp found it unbelievable as she continued. The person responsible for Jennifer Atkinson&rsquo;s death was now dating Jason?!</p></div>
