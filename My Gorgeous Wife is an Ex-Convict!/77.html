        <h1>Chapter 76</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace took the check and left the store with Lina.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was cursing and muttering and she could only imagine how the store personnel would gossip&mdash;and she didn&rsquo;t care.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She&rsquo;d meant to get under their skin. It was petty and unnecessary and she&rsquo;d only wanted Sean to feel shameful for a few brief seconds.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he&rsquo;d called her bluff and carried through with it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And Sean wasn&rsquo;t a wealthy man by accident. He was very stingy&mdash;when he wasn&rsquo;t trying to outdo himself for appearances.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, don't you think it's a little weird?" As soon as they walked out of the store, Lina said, &ldquo;Sean wrote you a huge check and gave it to you without hesitation. Lily was present too! Isn't he afraid his &lsquo;fiancee&rsquo; will lose her shit?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It is quite strange," Grace said neutrally.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Uh, does Sean still like you?&rdquo; Lina ventured.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace shrugged. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Grace, he just spent an obscene amount of money on you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;True. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s affection that prompted it. I don&rsquo;t even think it&rsquo;s ego. Sean&rsquo;s too cheap for that. I think it&rsquo;s fear. It seems that he is afraid that I will get mad at Zoe and then do harm to the Stevens Family," Grace voiced her intuitive speculations.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing this, Lina thought it was a bit ridiculous. "Isn't he thinking too much into it?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Who knows?" Grace shrugged and raised her hand to look at the check she was holding.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What are you going to do with that anyway? Are you going to tear it up?" she asked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;d love to see you spend it on yourself. It&rsquo;s the least that piece of shit can do, after how he and that trash Lily treated you. But something tells me you won&rsquo;t be taking that to the bank.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No. I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina shook her head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just going to tear it up?&rdquo; She was incredulous.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No. Why tear it up? I'll just donate it to someone who needs it," Grace answered and carefully put the check into her bag.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina beamed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like it!&rdquo; Then she sighed. &ldquo;That prick will probably use it as a tax write-off.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Both women laughed, and just like that, the painfulness of that encounter was forgotten.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">They had a meal after walking around for a while, and shared several small dishes in the mall food court. It was so much like old times! Grace could almost imagine that the last few years hadn&rsquo;t happened, and it was just the two of them catching up after a long week of corporate work.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But there was no undoing the past.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And seeing how she wouldn&rsquo;t be who she was now, stronger and more self-aware, she didn&rsquo;t resent it. If not for everything in the past, she wouldn&rsquo;t have come to know Jay. Today.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s head back,&rdquo; Grace said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had saved half her food and the full baklava dessert for Jay. She was eager to take it home to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When they were about to enter the escalator to the underground parking lot, they saw Sean, Zoe, and Lily again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ugh, these people were like a bad rash that just wouldn't go away!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The trio looked miserable&mdash;various expressions of anger, disbelief and good old-fashioned hatred. They all stopped talking when they saw Grace and Lina approaching the escalator.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace had a moment&rsquo;s pause where she almost held Lina back and suggested that they walk around the long way, but she didn&rsquo;t want to appear weak.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She followed Lina&rsquo;s lead, lifting her head and keeping her eyes straight ahead.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe glared and shook her head.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about it, sister,&rdquo; Sean warned. &ldquo;If you so much as say another word to her again, I&rsquo;ll have you sent abroad.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe couldn&rsquo;t believe it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d punish me!? For this murderous bitch!?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Grace walked quicker toward the escalator and was about to pass by them, Zoe suddenly stretched out her foot right in Grace's path.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was caught off guard and tripped. She pitched forward, and the moving steps caused her to tumble and fall.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina screamed in shock and quickly ran to the side of the escalator to press the emergency stop button.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even so, it was already too late. Grace had rolled down a lot of steps.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina raced down the stairs. &ldquo;Are you okay? Can you move? Tell me what hurts?&rdquo; Before Grace could reply, Lina was screaming up to the top floor at Zoe. "Do you know that you could've killed her?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe put a hand to her chest as if she couldn&rsquo;t believe that someone would say such a thing. "She walked without looking where she was going and insisted on hitting my foot. It's all her fault that she fell!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't bullshit me,&rdquo; Lina screamed. &ldquo;We'll find out the moment we take a look at the security camera recording!" Lina said angrily. &ldquo;And I swear to God if she&rsquo;s hurt, I&rsquo;m pressing charges!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She then looked nervously at Grace and said, "Grace, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It hurts..." Grace gasped from the pain. She was in shock and her heart was pounding. Every bone seemed to ache and she worried that she might have broken something.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'll take you to the hospital right now," Lina said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You just fell down some steps and you are going to go to the hospital!? You're really making a big deal out of nothing. Are you going to ask me for medical reimbursement next?" Zoe said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But no one had expected that in the next moment Zoe's face would be slapped so viciously that she would almost fall from the escalator step herself.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Brother!" Zoe held her face with her hands and looked at Sean in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean's face was merciless. "Apologize! Apologize to Grace right now!"</p></div>
