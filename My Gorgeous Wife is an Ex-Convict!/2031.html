        <h1>Chapter 2029</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really?" Jason looked at Grace, who was staring blankly at the scene in front of her. "Do you think it's enough too? If you don't, I can make it more pleasing to the eyes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's enough. It's enough," Grace said meekly in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'In other words, is Jay still jealous?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It seemed she would have to comfort Jay when they got home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason then patted Hadwin Stephenson on the shoulder and sat back on his chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at Jason thoughtfully, then said to the worried-looking Lina nearby, "What's wrong? I thought you like watching these."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina rolled her eyes. "That doesn't mean I like seeing you and other men..." After a pause, she added, "Well, you guys would have kissed if I hadn't grabbed you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's nothing even if we kissed," said Hadwin Stephenson. It meant nothing to him unless she was the one he kissed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Lina's jaw dropped as soon as he said that. "No. You can't kiss him! Hadwin Stephenson, only I can kiss you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She kissed him on the lips after she spoke. She only realized suddenly that her best friend and Jason were also in the private room when the kiss ended!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though Lina was rather thick-skinned, she ended up blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After their meal, the two men went home with their own women. However, when Lina got into the car, Grace suddenly walked to Hadwin Stephenson and said something before getting into Jason's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After Hadwin Stephenson got into the car, Lina asked, "What did Grace say to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nothing. She said you're pregnant and asked me to take good care of you," said Hadwin Stephenson as he started the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As the car slowly pulled out of the parking lot, what Grace just said to him flashed through his mind...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, have you ever thought of marrying Lina? Everyone knows that Lina is pregnant with your baby now but they only know her as Miss Sweeney, not Mrs. Stephenson. Although Lina appears indifferent, I don't want people gossiping about her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Marry...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Yeah, I should have mentioned marriage when I decided to start over with her, shouldn't I?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he had not formally mentioned it to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was too careless. He did not expect so many rumors to spread when he dragged the matter out. Even if she and her parents would not overthink it, what about her friends, relatives, and neighbors?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What would they think of her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why don't I take you home now?" asked Hadwin Stephenson as he looked at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"There's no hurry. I want to go to your office and spend more time with you this afternoon!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, take a nap if you're sleepy. I'll wake you up when we reach." He knew that she would get sleepy after eating these days. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh," she responded as she nodded. She closed her eyes in a daze. However, before she fell asleep, she did not forget to say to Hadwin Stephenson, "By the way, you can't fall in love with Jason. He only has eyes for Grace.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was instantly between laughter and tears when he heard that.</p></div>
