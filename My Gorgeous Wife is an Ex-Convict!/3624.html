        <h1>Chapter 3622</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you planning to go to the school gate?" Roger said. "Do you think it would make a difference if you go there now? Will it help William face less criticism or completely resolve this matter for him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's none of your business!" Jasper said, struggling to free her hand from his grip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't go!" Roger said. "Even if you go there now, it won't have any effect. Instead, it might bring criticism to the Reed family! When you are exposed in front of those cameras, you're not just Jasper, but also representing the Reed family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what?" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, even in that case, you still want to go?" Roger said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" Jasper replied. "I represent the Reed family, and likewise, the Reed family is my support. I believe my family would approve of me making this choice!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them stared at each other, and after a moment, Roger finally spoke, "So... don't regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't regret it!" she said!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, when Lawrence needed protection, she didn't act in time, and that is something she has regretted ever since. So she won't let herself have any more regrets!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger let go of her hand, and Jasper rushed towards the school gate without looking back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when some people noticed her, they immediately pointed their camera phones at her. Some even called out her name directly, saying to the live camera, "Hey, everyone, guess who I just saw? It's the princess of the Reed family, Jasper! Can you believe it? Is she here for William? What exactly is their relationship? Let's wait and see!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The camera flashes and the chaotic chatter made Jasper feel uncomfortable. But at this moment, the person she cared most about was William, standing in the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She walked up to William and asked, "Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William frowned, "Why did you come?" He could handle this embarrassment himself, but he didn't want her to face such embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You were blocked here, so of course I had to come," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On her way here, she had already contacted the school's security office and knew that they were organizing security and would arrive soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back quickly!" William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I can still go back now?" Jasper replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, they were completely surrounded, and the crowd around them was still expanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now they could only hope that the school security guards would arrive soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, after a while, the school security guards hurried over and squeezed into the crowd, pushing them apart a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper held William's hand, ready to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, someone in the crowd asked Jasper, "Reed, there are rumors that the two of you are not just childhood friends, but also boyfriend and girlfriend. Is this true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper paused in his steps, and others held up their phones, all aiming them at Jasper, many of them with live streaming cameras.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pursed his lips, thinking about how to answer.</span></p></div>
