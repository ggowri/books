        <h1>Chapter 1634</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the kiss was over, he gasped and looked at her with a somewhat pale face. "Are you sure you won't get back together with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His voice instantly pulled her back to reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She glared at the man before her. He was no longer the man who did not allow them to break up once they decided to date and the man who would dote on her unconditionally, chase after celebrities with her, and watch cheesy dramas with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This man prioritized his career when she was suffering and needed his company the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They never had anything in common.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, I won't," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a grim look in his eyes. "Then who are you going to be with? Anthony Sherman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She said, "So what if I am? He's a good man, and I feel at ease with him. Hadwin Stephenson, since you can marry Katherine Jackson, can't I be with Anthony Sherman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But you don't love him. If you did, you would&rsquo;ve bitten me and became disgusted when I kissed you earlier.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Shut up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"By the way, does Anthony Sherman know that we were together once? Does he know how you and I had made love together? Does he know&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Shut up! Hadwin Stephenson, who are you to say these?!" As she bellowed, a loud slap rang in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina only felt her palm aching badly. She could not believe... she actually slapped him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's face was slapped sideways. A moment later, a clear red mark appeared on his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He slowly turned to look at Lina after some time. However, his eyes had turned lifeless. "You're right. I don't have the right... I'm sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He spoke as he slowly turned around. "Stay here for a few days. I'll give you an explanation in a few days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson left the house, and Lina glared at the people in front of her. They were supposedly here to protect her, but she could not even leave the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Stephenson has asked you to stay calm, Miss Sweeney. Later, your parents will also be here to take shelter temporarily," the leader of the men said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What? My parents are coming too?" Lina's eyes widened in surprise. 'Is Hadwin Stephenson... planning on letting my entire family take shelter?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson returned to the car, feeling exhausted. He commanded the driver lightly, "Drive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson closed his eyes. 'Don't I... know better than anyone that I don't deserve to be with her anymore?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But... But I can't help but think that maybe there's a chance to change everything. Maybe... Lina can forgive me and give me the time I need!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He should not have kissed her, but he had impulsively forgotten everything just now. He just wanted to keep that woman for himself and did not want her to think of another man!</p></div>
