        <h1>Chapter 3541</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's eyes couldn't help but fill with tears. In this moment, it was as if the whole world had disappeared for her, leaving only her and him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next moment, there was a burst of exclamations around them, as Jasper had rushed straight to him and hugged him tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some of the people around them recognized Jasper and were shocked to see her behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Jasper was quite famous in school, and recently, the most talked-about speculation was about her relationship with William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the two currently claim to be childhood friends, many people believe that they may be in a romantic relationship. After all, William's tenderness towards Jasper is obvious to everyone, as is his coldness towards other girls!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lawrence, it's you, isn't it? It has to be you!" Jasper murmured as she hugged him tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It must be him, and it can only be him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face bears some resemblance to Lawrence from their childhood, and his music also echoes Lawrence's playing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It couldn't be a coincidence, it must be him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a cold voice rang out above her head, "I'm sorry, but you've got the wrong person. My name is not Lawrence. Also, isn't it impolite to hug someone like this in public?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper finally snapped out of it and looked up at the face that was so close to hers. "You're not... Lawrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I'm not," the other person smiled slightly, but there was a hint of disgust in their eyes. "And I don't like being hugged by strangers, so you better let go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Grace didn't let go. She continued to hold onto him, her eyes fixed on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He furrowed his brows slightly. "Are you not going to let go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." She hesitated, was he really not Lawrence? If he wasn't, then it was indeed impolite to hug him like this, but her hands seemed to be out of control, Grace hugged him tightly, as if she had recognized him as Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was afraid... If she let go, she would never find Lawrence again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His brows furrowed even more, then he exerted a little force, broke free from her grip, and walked away on his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper stared blankly at his gradually disappearing figure, suddenly feeling a sense of emptiness in her heart. Before she could figure it out, her body had instinctively chased after him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if her body didn't want this boy to leave her sight like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under the shade of the trees on campus, her hand finally caught the hem of the other person's clothes. "Wait...wait a minute!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boy stopped in his tracks. "What do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you really not Lawrence?" She gasped, speaking seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't go by that name," the other person replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then what's your name?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't think I need to tell you," he said with a hint of amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're not the Lawrence I know, then tell me your name!" Jasper stared at him intently, his face showing determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two locked eyes in silence for a moment before the other finally spoke slowly, "My name is Roger Elliott, not the Lawrence you mentioned. Can you let go now?"</p></div>
