        <h1>Chapter 373</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace placed the ingredients in the fridge, she turned around to see Jason leaning on the kitchen&rsquo;s door frame, pondering about something as he looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned away in an attempt to avoid Jason&rsquo;s gaze. The thing was, if she wanted to exit the kitchen, she would have to face the possibility of being pulled by the arm by him. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t said goodnight to me,&rdquo; He said to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was taken aback for a moment but quickly replied, &ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A smile broke out on Jason&rsquo;s face while he was still staring at her. &ldquo;Sis, your goodnight seems to be getting more perfunctory.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;...&rdquo; Grace was speechless and did not know how to respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Someone suggested that if I want you to like me, I should try to please you.&rdquo; Jason bent down and looked at the person in front of him at eye level. &ldquo;What do you think? Would you like me if I pleased you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had the urge to bite her tongue. Her eyes widened in disbelief as she stared at him. &lsquo;What is he saying? He... wants to please me?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Why would he say such things?!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s expression seemed to amuse Jason. &ldquo;Why? Are you that shocked to hear me say that I want to please you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Grace felt as if all the words she had wanted to say were stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his hand and gently touched her lips. &ldquo;So, Sis, you should realize how much I want you to like me. Tell me, how should I please you to make you like me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s face seemed to flush as her heart pounded rapidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had never imagined that Jason would say such a thing to her? &lsquo;He wants me to like him? Even to the extent of pleasing me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;How much of his feelings for me are real?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, Grace did not voice those questions out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the afternoon of Tomb Sweeping Day, Jason went to the hospital to visit Old Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Have you visited your father&rsquo;s grave?&rdquo; Old Master Reed asked. A man who was once powerful and almighty had now been reduced to a frail old man, stuck on a hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, Old Master Reed would visit the grave of Jason&rsquo;s father with him. However, ever since the old man&rsquo;s health began to deteriorate, Jason began visiting the grave before visiting his grandfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;How do you think your father would feel if he knew you&rsquo;re being bewitched by a woman? I think he&rsquo;d give you a slap to wake up!&rdquo; Old Master Reed scoffed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed did not like the fact that he was gradually losing control of his grandson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Grandpa, are you trying to remind me about something?&rdquo; Jason raised his brows as he looked at the old man. His pair of eyes that looked like peach blossoms were so beautiful that they reminded the old man of Jason&rsquo;s mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Those eyes look so alike that woman&rsquo;s!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it had not been for that woman in the past, Old Master Reed would not have been on bad terms with his son. Consequently, his son would not have left home and died outside.</p></div>
