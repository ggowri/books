        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William paused for a moment, then let out a long breath. Yes, he was getting a bit confused because of Roger's appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William, were you angry just now?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," he replied, raising his hand to gently stroke her forehead. "I'm just worried about you. We don't know much about Roger, so you should be careful since you're friends with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I understand," Jasper responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then you go in and rest well," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper waved at him and turned to walk towards the door of the girls' dormitory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After taking a few steps, she seemed to have thought of something and turned back to him. "William, even if you can't play the piano, or even if one day you stop playing, you will still be my most important friend. I like you, not because of your piano!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, she turned around and walked towards the dormitory again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching her back, William's hand hanging by his side tightened slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knows that he doesn't just want to be her best friend. When will she finally understand his feelings?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He will patiently wait until she understands love, and then he will tell her how much he loves her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, are you going to the mixer?" Meave, Jasper's dorm mate, asked him. The other people in the dorm were also looking at Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mixer?" Jasper blinked. "Is it the kind of event where you go to find a boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They say it's only for singles, but some people bring their boyfriends or girlfriends. It's just a way for everyone to get together and have fun. The other attendees are also from our school. Someone organized it on the school forum to help people meet new friends," Meave explained. "The three of us are planning to go. Are you coming too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other two people in the dorm, Horea and Nina, also chimed in, "Jasper, let's go together. After all, this can be considered a collective activity for our dorm!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, it's just everyone playing around together. It's not like we have to find someone to date at the mixer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper thought about it and realized that she hadn't been to a mixer before. She was curious and didn't want to be left out since she was in college now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay then!" Jasper agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Great!" the other three laughed. With Jasper joining in, this mixer was sure to be lively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When William found out that Jasper was going to attend a mixer, his face immediately changed. "You're going to a mixer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, I haven't been to one before. I don't know if it's like in TV shows or comics, but the guys in our dorm said it's just for fun, to hang out together and have a good time," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William pursed his lips slightly. "But some people go there to find boyfriends or girlfriends. What if they think you're there for the same reason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I'll just say no," Jasper said. "I won't like them anyway, so of course I'll refuse."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what if you do like someone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" She blinked her eyes, "If she likes it, then she should accept it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His heart sank as she answered so casually, which meant that she didn't have anyone she liked at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Similarly, he didn't either!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She only liked him as a friend, not as someone she could date.</p></div>
