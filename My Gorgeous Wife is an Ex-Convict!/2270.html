        <h1>Chapter 2268</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert did not seem content as he said maliciously, "Haha, the head of Weiss Group is behaving just like a dog right now. Since you care so much about this b*tch, why don't you show the woman what you look like now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Mr. Lambert finished, Kyla felt the strip of cloth wrapped around her eyes loosen. She could finally see everything in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla's pupils instantly constricted when she caught sight of Martin Weiss's figure. She felt a pain exploding in her chest all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is that... Martin Weiss?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The proud man was on his knees, and he was hitting himself with a rough stick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was blood all over his head and hands. How bad were the injuries on the parts of his body that were concealed by his clothes? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, Martin Weiss, don&rsquo;t! Everybody, don't listen to him!" Kyla shouted even though the pain in her neck intensified with every word she uttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I told you not to speak or you'll bleed more," Martin Weiss said with some difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes immediately turned wet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Mr. Lambert suddenly said, "Since you love each other so much... Martin Weiss, you want me to stop her bleeding for her, right? How about we trade wounds for wounds? Cut yourself in your neck and I'll stop her bleeding!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was shocked when she heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police behind Martin Weiss also began to advise Martin Weiss not to act impulsively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A policeman even said to Mr. Lambert, "You have the money and the car you asked for. Why are you deliberately causing more trouble?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just want to torture him!" Mr. Lambert&rsquo;s eyes contained madness and hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was a businessman, but he got to where he was now because he offended Martin Weiss because of Kyla. Even if he received a lot of money, he could only hide abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His family was still in the country, and they would probably be implicated because of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the plan now was nothing like his original plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He previously wanted to use Kyla's disappearance to get credit from Martin Weiss, so he never thought about moving his family away. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, Mr. Lambert cut his dagger across Kyla's neck once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Kyla bit her lip firmly, refraining from crying out in pain. She was scared that Martin Weiss would agree to Mr. Lambert's request if she did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, how could Martin Weiss ignore it when her neck was bleeding?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay! I'll do it. You can cut me as much as you want as long as you don't hurt her," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Awesome!" said Mr. Lambert as he asked one of his thugs to take a dagger and hand it to Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss took the dagger and was about to cut himself in the neck when Kyla suddenly shouted, "Martin Weiss, I already told you that we owe each other nothing. I don't need you to save me like this! Even if you hurt yourself, this man will still hurt me. Whatever you do is pointless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked intently at Kyla. "You were the one who said we owe each other nothing, not me. And I told you I would protect you and our children no matter what."</p></div>
