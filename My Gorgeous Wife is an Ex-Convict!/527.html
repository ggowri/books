        <h1>Chapter 526</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Wang's face grew solemn. Meanwhile, Tasha Farmer indignantly said, "Grace must be doing this on purpose because she wants to put on airs. That woman is only doing this because Jason is currently interested in her..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Wang's anxiety rose sharply. Perhaps the matter was not as simple as he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since they said they have no time, let's go home, Dad," said Tasha Farmer as she pursed her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right after Tasha Farmer finished speaking, Mr. Wang's phone rang. The next instant, after answering the call, Mr. Wang&rsquo;s face turned pale. Additionally, he begun sweating profusely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer looked puzzled. Having seen her father end the call in a daze, she could not help but ask, "What's wrong, Dad?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Wang immediately raised his hand in response and slapped Tasha Farmer. "Great, you've caused our family great trouble this time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their tax scandal could no longer be hidden. The phone call earlier was from someone Mr. Wang had managed to get in touch with. That person broke the news to him that his family would be thoroughly investigated this time and no one could help him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Furthermore, it was not just a matter of paying taxes and fines. Once they had paid off the taxes according to the penalty, their company's cash flow would be cut off. Consequently, if their cash flow stopped, their whole company would be in hot water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A bank loan would give the company some time to recompose itself. However, the problem was... would any of the banks lend them any money? Mr. Wang thought of what the Reed family's butler had just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did Jason... know that the Farmer family would fall into such a crisis? Or perhaps... Jason was the cause of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the person Mr. Wang had connections with had told him that he could buy him half a month&rsquo;s worth of time. Then, as long as Mr. Wang managed to find someone to help him in half a month&rsquo;s time, his family had room to turn things around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was now no room for maneuver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment, Mr. Wang only wished to strangle his daughter. The brainless daughter of his had dragged the entire Farmer family to hell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment, in the Reed Residence, Grace was unaware of what was going on outside. She was sitting on the couch in the living and watching the latest TV series.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It has to be said that even the TV set in the Reed Residence was made to look like a small cinema screen. Watching a TV series was like watching a movie in the movie theater.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt a lot better being able to go to work in the restaurant for the past few days. Evidently, her mood was also because Nelson was doing very well after the surgery; he was making rapid progress. Grace could even observe Nelson's progress each day with her own eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In a good mood?" Jason walked over to the couch in the living room and took a seat beside Grace. The servants had not disturbed Grace about the Farmer family's visit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, in Jason&rsquo;s opinion, it was only a small matter. He did not want it to spoil Grace&rsquo;s good mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yep." Grace smiled and shared her joy with Jason. "You know what? Nelson can now understand what I'm saying by listening to me without looking at my mouth. It's like he's a genius."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Genius?" Jason snorted softly at this. "He's a bit like his father then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His father? Grace was stunned for a moment. Then, her eyes widened in astonishment. "You know who Nelson's father is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Jason was quick to admit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She had wondered who Nelson's father was and why he was never at Kyla's side. Some of her colleagues at the restaurant had mentioned to her in private that Kyla probably had a child out of wedlock.</p></div>
