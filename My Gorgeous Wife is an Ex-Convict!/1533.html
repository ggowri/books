        <h1>Chapter 1531</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper had heard from the maid who was with her that her father was in the study, so she asked which room was the study and ran into it. She had so much to say to her father!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who let you in?" Jason's brows furrowed in displeasure as he broke the silence of the study. He usually liked to think things over in the study, so he never liked people disturbing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In particular, he was thinking about Grace. The mochi-like face in front of him looked just like Grace&rsquo;s face, which somehow upset him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He just could not tell why he was upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I let myself in." The little one raised her chin and said, "I want to take a good look at my daddy, and Daddy should also take a good look at me. I'm your baby too from now on. Don't mistake me for someone else!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I recognized Daddy at a glance and didn&rsquo;t mistake him for someone else!' The little one felt proud again at the thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who told you to call me &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo;?" Jason asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one blinked her almond-shaped eyes, which were similar to Grace's. "Mommy told me to call you that. Mommy said you're my daddy and showed me your photo. Unfortunately, the photo is ruined, but Mommy said I can take as many photos of you as I want after meeting you. By the way, Daddy, my name's Jasper Reed, but I prefer the name Jasper Reed. Can I use the name Jasper Reed in kindergarten?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one kept talking. She also listed out her preferences, what color she liked, what food she liked, and what stories she liked to listen to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason instantly had a headache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If this munchkin is my daughter, then she's a chatterbox compared to my son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And... Take photos?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I&rsquo;ve never enjoyed taking photos. How could Grace make such random promises?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jason had a strange feeling when he learned that his daughter's name also had the same &lsquo;Jay&rsquo; word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Daddy, hug me!" The little one held up her little arms as if she wanted him to hug her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips tightly together and did not move. He had hardly hugged Mick since he started kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now, the munchkin he just met today wanted a hug?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The father and daughter stared at each other. The little one's bright almond-shaped eyes widened, and her little arms seemed to feel a little sore from holding them up. "Don't you like me, Daddy?" Those almond-shaped eyes were beginning to get watery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason seemed to feel a pang in her heart suddenly, and he almost reflexively hugged the tiny person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper instantly showed a smile on her tiny face. The tears in her eyes also vanished, and her two little arms wrapped around Jason's neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Um, Mommy's right. Daddy does like me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, Jason realized he had picked the little one up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her soft little body was almost of the same height as Mick, but it was a very different feeling than holding his son. Especially when the two small arms were so close to his shoulders and neck. There was an inexplicable intimacy when her tiny body was nestled against him.</p></div>
