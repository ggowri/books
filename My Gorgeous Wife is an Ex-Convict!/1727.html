        <h1>Chapter 1725</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hey, wait. Jay, Lina is still inside..." said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson will send Lina home. You don't have to worry," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Or do you want to stay and touch Hadwin Stephenson's face to see how it feels?" He glanced at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No!" Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Since your answer is no, then let&rsquo;s go home,&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the private room, Hadwin Stephenson pulled Lina's hands away before bending over and carrying Lina in his arms without saying a word. Then, he left the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hey, I... I'm not leaving. I want to continue drinking and playing the finger guessing game with them. I want to... Um... I want to watch them dance..." shouted Lina as she struggled to get down from Hadwin Stephenson's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, I'll drink with you, play the finger guessing game with you, and dance for you!" Hadwin Stephenson said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." In a daze, Lina tilted her head, seemingly thinking about what he was saying. She stopped struggling and quietly allowed him to hold her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson strode out of the private room with Lina in his arms. He paused at the door and glanced at Manager Wang, who was still waiting outside. He said, "I don't want word to get out about what happened tonight. If I hear about it, I&rsquo;ll shut down your nightclub.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Manager Wang quickly answered, "Yes, yes! Mr. Stephenson, you won't hear anything about tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson left with Lina in his arms. Only then did Manager Wang take a long breath, feeling that his life had shortened by several years after tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason and Hadwin Stephenson. Who would have thought that these two would come here one after another? Besides, neither of them was a pushover. Anyone would have a hard time if they messed with those two! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Manager Wang hurried into the private room and briefed the ten male escorts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson carried Lina into the car. When he put Lina in the back seat, his face paled a little more. His forehead was faintly covered with sweat, and he was clenching his teeth. He looked like he was enduring something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina lay on the back seat of the car like a cat, rubbing and touching against the surface.. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Moments later, Hadwin Stephenson's complexion gradually returned to normal. He took a deep breath and bent over to buckle Lina's seat belt. Then, he returned to the driver's seat and started the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car drove to the Sweeney family's residential area and arrived at the parking lot near Lina's apartment building. Hadwin Stephenson unbuckled his seat belt, got out of the car, and went to the back seat. He saw Lina lying there with her eyes closed, looking asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina?" He unbuckled her seat belt as he called out her name. "Are you asleep?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hmm?" She seemed to react to his words as she slowly opened her eyes. However, her unfocused eyes seemed to be telling him that she was still drunk. Even if she were not asleep, she was probably out of her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm going to carry you home now," said Hadwin Stephenson as he bent over to carry Lina out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the next moment, her hand reached over and caught his collar.</p></div>
