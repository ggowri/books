        <h1>Chapter 3627</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why...did you abandon me back then?" Roger muttered softly, "Is it because William is the heir of the Barlow family, and I am nothing? Jasper, tell me, why exactly..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yet at this moment, the quiet street had no one to answer his question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger hugged his knees, burying his face in them, resembling a discarded child sitting alone on the steps. It felt as if, at this moment, he was the only one left in the world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After an unknown amount of time, footsteps suddenly echoed, not just one person's, but several pairs of footsteps.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, these footsteps stopped in front of Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Leston, the one who told me to get lost earlier!" the woman who had spoken to Roger before said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid, I'll make him kneel before you soon!" The other person reassured the woman, then shouted at Roger, "I advise you not to play dead. If you can make my sister kneel down now and make her happy, I might spare you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Roger maintained the same posture and didn't move at all, as if he hadn't heard what the other person said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leston, the man, couldn't stand losing face and yelled loudly, "Hey, did you hear me? If you keep playing dead, don't blame me for being impolite!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without lifting his head, Roger lazily spat out one word, "Go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leston and the people with him were clearly enraged, and the woman said, "Leston, this guy is really infuriating. You must teach him a lesson!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I will definitely make him remember!" Leston said, taking a stick and swinging it towards Roger!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before the stick could touch Roger's body, he caught it with one hand. Then, he looked expressionless at the other person and said, "I told you, go away!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold gaze and the aura of hostility emanating from Roger made Leston suddenly tremble, giving him a bad feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What... What are you, punk..." Leston said, trying to retrieve the stick from his hand, but the force from the other person was so strong that he couldn't pull it back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leston's face turned red, and he shouted at his subordinates, "Why don't you all beat this guy for me?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When those few subordinates heard this, they quickly rushed forward to attack Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger exerted a sudden force and completely snatched the stick from Leston's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately after, a nearly one-sided brawl erupted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wherever Roger's stick landed, someone would fall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the silent night, there were continuous cries of pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Leston was beaten to the point where blood was flowing from his head, his arm hanging by his side was broken, and who knows how many of his ribs were fractured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Leston deeply regretted why he had come and ended up provoking this crazy character in front of him.</span></p></div>
