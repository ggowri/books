        <h1>Chapter 3482</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon arrival, he realized that the situation was far beyond his imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As their car approached the location, it was attacked and the driver, along with the car, crashed into a nearby tree and passed out. Several armed men dragged the driver out of the car and took him away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He managed to jump out of the car at the moment of the attack and hide in the bushes, temporarily avoiding detection by the attackers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, his phone was lost during the jump and he didn't know where it went.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What worried him even more was that he overheard the attackers mentioning that they had kidnapped Veronica and Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was his girlfriend and Jasper was his sister!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now without communication devices or a car, he couldn't risk leaving and going back to the Reed family to discuss a plan, nor could he recklessly charge in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he was confident in his own abilities, he didn't know how many weapons the attackers had, and he didn't know the condition of Veronica and Jasper. Therefore, he needed to assess the situation before taking action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Regardless, he was determined to rescue both Veronica and Jasper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, at the thought of Veronica, he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they ended things on bad terms before, would she be happy to see him if they met again? Would he be the one to save her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or maybe she's still angry with him after all this time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other side of things, Jason found out that Mason had the driver take him away from the Reed family and began tracking the whereabouts of the Reed family's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't difficult to find the car's location since all of the Reed family's cars have GPS systems.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once they confirmed the location of the car that Mason was traveling in, the Reed family and the police rushed to the GPS location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel was tied up and filled with fear. His sister and Jasper hadn't seen the true faces of these people, so they might have a chance to survive. But Lionel had seen their faces and might end up like in a movie, losing his life to these people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Lionel deeply regretted his terrible idea of faking a kidnapping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't have thought of anything better and had to go and cause this fake kidnapping!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could feel that the kidnappers were planning to move to a different location after bringing in an unconscious, bloodied person. They also occasionally looked at him with eyes that seemed to want him dead, making him even more anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, one of the thugs who had been guarding Veronica and Jasper in a small room in the warehouse came out, holding his bleeding head and stumbling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No... something's wrong, those two women... they ran away," the man said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? They ran away?" Upon hearing this, the other kidnappers immediately changed their expressions. The leader even rushed to the injured man and asked, "How could they have run away? Weren't their hands and feet tied and their eyes covered?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes... that's true, but... I couldn't resist the temptation and wanted to have some fun... but then I accidentally made a mistake..." the man said nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately, the leader didn't care about the man's bleeding head and slapped him in the face. "When will you stop thinking about playing around? Didn't I tell you not to touch them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man was almost unable to stand after being slapped. "I just thought that since we couldn't touch the Reed family girl, we could at least do something to Lionel's sister. Who knew..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, at this moment, everyone was more concerned about the whereabouts of the two girls!</p></div>
