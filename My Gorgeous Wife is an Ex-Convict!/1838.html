        <h1>Chapter 1836</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason stepped out to catch up. He glanced at the hand he had just shaken with Mrs. Watts before staring thoughtfully at the figure walking in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What is Mrs. Watts... afraid of?' Her hand was obviously trembling when he shook it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts and his wife had already booked a hotel. They did not want to stay in Reed Residence, hence Jason and Grace sent them there and planned to have dinner with them in a famous hotel in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The triplets were all present for dinner. Besides the triplets, Veronica Barlow and William also came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Veronica Barlow was here because of Mason. Speaking of which, Mason stuck to Veronica Barlow like taffy. Except when Veronica Barlow went to school, Mason would follow her wherever she went.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It had become more obvious&mdash;especially after Mason's identity was exposed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace had consulted a psychologist and understood that the child was suffering from emotional distress. In some ways, he had imprinted on Veronica Barlow. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because Veronica Barlow was the only one who protected Mason back then. The little one instinctively depended on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the other hand, William came because of Jasper Reed's insistence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts looked at the triplets with joy and handed out red envelopes to the children. Meanwhile, Mrs. Watts took out three braided bracelets with gold longevity locks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's for the three children&rsquo;s safety," said Mrs. Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts said, "My wife weaved these three bracelets herself. They took her almost a month to finish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could see that the weaves were different from what she usually saw in the commercially sold bracelets. Mrs. Watts&rsquo;s weaving pattern appeared very complicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you, Mrs. Watts," said Grace as she took the three bracelets and let the three little ones wear them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As there were only three bracelets, Mrs. Watts prepared two more red envelopes and gave them to Veronica Barlow and William respectively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At dinner, Jason nonchalantly asked, "Mrs. Watts, your accent is a little different from the locals of L City. I wonder where you're from?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts paused what she was doing and said a little drily, "I'm... from a small place, but I moved to L City a long time ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really?" Jason smiled faintly. "Which small place did you come from? Maybe I've been there too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Clang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The glass Mrs. Watts was holding slipped out of her hand, spilling its contents onto the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts and Grace hurriedly took paper towels to help wipe the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts asked his wife, "What's come over you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm just... a little nervous." Mrs. Watts gasped and said, "After all, I&rsquo;m meeting the patriarch of the Reed family... upon coming to Emerald City. I've only seen him in the newspapers... before this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said, "Mrs. Watts, you&rsquo;re the wife of Grace's mentor, so I consider you as my mentor&rsquo;s wife too. You don't need to be nervous with me. Don't think of me as the patriarch of the Reed family. I'm just Grace's husband. You can call me Jason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts stared blankly at Jason, who looked gentle and was smiling. Her eyes watered.</p></div>
