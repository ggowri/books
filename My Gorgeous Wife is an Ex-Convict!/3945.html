        <h1>Chapter 3943</h1>
        <div><p>Did he not find her attractive since they didn&#x27;t have sex?</p><p>&quot;Why?&quot; she asked, her words already one step ahead of her emotions.</p><p>&quot;If you really want to sleep with me, then don&#x27;t get so drunk. You don&#x27;t think I would want to hold a woman who&#x27;s shaking all over from being drunk, do you?&quot; Mick said.</p><p>Nancy was speechless.</p><p>&quot;And...&quot; Mick paused, looking at her with a sharpness in his eyes. &quot;Nancy, do you really like me?&quot;</p><p>A chill ran down her spine for a moment. &quot;Yes, I really do,&quot; she said, trying to suppress her panic and not avoid his gaze.</p><p>His lips curved slightly. &quot;I hate being deceived, so during the time we spend together, I hope you won&#x27;t deceive me. If you want something, just tell me directly, but don&#x27;t lie to me. Because people who lie to me usually don&#x27;t end up well.&quot;</p><p>Nancy&#x27;s body trembled slightly, and she forced a smile. &quot;I know, I won&#x27;t lie to you.&quot;</p><p>...</p><p>Mick&#x27;s warning echoed in her mind.</p><p>But there were some deceptions that had been there from the beginning, and they could only be carried through to the end.</p><p>But... was liking him really a lie? Although at first, she didn&#x27;t have much of a feeling for Mick, at most she just thought he was the high and mighty Reed family&#x27;s young master, someone who had nothing to do with her. And... his appearance, he just looked pleasing to the eye.</p><p>As long as she could really like Mick in the future, then it wouldn&#x27;t be considered a lie.</p><p>And Mick was already a man who was easy to make a woman&#x27;s heart flutter, it wasn&#x27;t hard to like him!</p><p>Yes, it wasn&#x27;t hard!</p><p>Nancy kept telling herself this in her heart.</p><p>Thanks to her persistence, Mick stopped coming to pick her up at the hotel where she worked. They would usually agree on a meeting place, and sometimes Mick would send a driver to pick her up.</p><p>At that time, Nancy would have the driver wait for her 500 meters away from the company.</p><p>The rumors about her in the hotel finally died down.</p><p>Some people would mock her behind her back, saying that rich people were just playing with her and wouldn&#x27;t take her seriously. They would get tired of her in no time.</p><p>Nancy didn&#x27;t pay any attention to this kind of ridicule.</p><p>It was the new receptionist, Irene, who took the initiative to befriend her and apologized for bumping into her before.</p><p>&quot;I was in a bad mood that day, so I accidentally bumped into you and didn&#x27;t apologize in time. I&#x27;m really sorry.&quot; Irene looked guilty and even gave Nancy a teddy bear as a gift. &quot;This little gift is just a token of my apology.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You don&#x27;t have to give me a gift. It was just a bump, and you&#x27;ve already apologized. It&#x27;s okay.&quot; Nancy politely declined.</p><p>&quot;No, please accept the gift. It represents your acceptance of my apology. If you don&#x27;t take it, I&#x27;ll feel like you haven&#x27;t forgiven me.&quot; Irene insisted and handed the teddy bear to Nancy.</p><p>&quot;Okay then...&quot; Nancy hesitated for a moment before accepting the gift.</p><p>&quot;After work, let&#x27;s have dinner and go shopping together. I haven&#x27;t been in the company for long and haven&#x27;t made any friends yet. I hope we can be friends in the future.&quot; Irene smiled and suggested.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t today. I have something to do after work. Maybe another day.&quot; Nancy declined.</p></div>
