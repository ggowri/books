        <h1>Chapter 105</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was locked up in a room by the Miller family, and there was a stranger in the room. He was... the fool of the Miller family.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace tried her best to remain clear-headed. She had to escape, no matter what!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now that she was in such a state, it was difficult for her to stand up. How could she escape? When she was carried over by her uncles, she secretly tried to call someone for help, but her phone was taken away.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Whatever chance she had to escape was all gone!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why? Why did she call Jay first? Obviously, Jason was in Emerald City and could not help her at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Furthermore, what could Jay do? Perhaps she should have called Lina since she could be a little more useful, or call the police directly...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was as if she had started to rely on Jay without realizing.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her vision had become blurred. The strange man smirked and rushed over to her. She could only try her best to dodge away, but she couldn't avoid that figure.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Outside the room, the Miller and Kelleigh families were happily calculating the accounts for a while.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's uncle said, "Mr. Miller, we have brought her for you. 300 grand, you can't go back on your word."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh, good, good. As long as they finish up, I will give you 300,000 dollars," Jeremy said. In order to let his son get married and plant a seed for the Miller family, he was willing to go all out this time.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeremy's wife said worriedly, "What if this young lady still plans to run afterward?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You can take some pictures of her to use them to blackmail her. Then we'll lock her up for a while. When the child is born, how can she run away? She will stay here and be your daughter-in-law," her uncle said. He didn't have any pity for Grace. He only had money on his mind.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's right. If a woman gives birth to a child, she won&rsquo;t think about running away anymore. You are also a woman, so you should understand," her second uncle said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeremy's wife thought about it and agreed. However, she was still a little worried. "Will... will he be able to achieve anything in the room? If she resists, our son..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How can she still have the strength to resist?" her second uncle said in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeremy also said, "Don't worry, I taught my son last night. No matter how stupid he is, he knows what to do!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jeremy's wife finally felt relieved.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The four people were eating and drinking in the yard. Suddenly, the sound of a car came from outside.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Whose car is it now that it's late?" Jeremy mumbled as he stood up. He was half-drunk as he walked to the entrance and opened the door. Just as he was about to say something, he was stunned on the spot.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the other side of the door, there were police cars surrounding the whole building. Jeremy suddenly sobered up.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What... what's going on?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, the policemen got out of the cars and surrounded the courtyard.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing that the policemen had surrounded them, Grace&rsquo;s uncles and Jeremy's wife were so scared that they didn't dare to utter a word. They didn't know what was going on.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Where is the woman you brought back here?" asked one of the officers, who looked like he was in charge.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The four people looked at each other. Jeremy struggled to say, "What... woman? We don't know what you are talking about."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The policeman did not bother to talk nonsense with him. He said, "Search!" Suddenly, the police began to search all the rooms.</p></div>
