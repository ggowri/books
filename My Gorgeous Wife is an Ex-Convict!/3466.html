        <h1>Chapter 3464</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's as if she's all alone, by herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a black car pulled up beside her on the road, and a figure got out and walked straight up to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked up and saw the familiar face in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, tears that couldn't be shed before came pouring out all at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suddenly hugged him tightly, with all her strength. In that moment, she finally felt that she was no longer alone, because there was someone who would always be there for her, no matter what happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hugged so tightly that Mason felt a slight, dull pain in his bones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But for him, even if it hurts, he is willing to endure it because it is her embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He always remembers that when he first joined the Barlow family, she was the first one to embrace him, which made him understand what warmth is.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was also the first time he had been hugged like that, and from then on, he understood the meaning of the word "embrace".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His chest was wet, he knew it was her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, why are you crying?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." Veronica paused, choked up, and said, "I broke up with Daniel. We're no longer together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems that when facing him, she can confess something that she feels extremely embarrassed about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My boyfriend fell in love at first sight with another girl, and I only found out about it through a group chat with classmates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He...he fell in love at first sight with another girl, so...we broke up..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is she the girl in the photo that was sent in the group?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She paused for a moment, then after a while, she finally realized. Yes, they were in the same class, so he was naturally in the group and had also seen that photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um, it's that photo," she sniffled and slowly released her hands from his embrace, moving slightly away from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He only felt a hollow feeling in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lifted his hand and wiped away her tears, then led her into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is Veronica going back now?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go back?" Veronica paused, thinking about her cold home, and shook her head. "I...I don't want to go home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What place does Veronica want to go?" asked Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica remained silent, unsure of where she wanted to go even to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing this, Mason immediately instructed the driver to take the car to a small amusement park in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is the old amusement park of Emerald City, which is also the place where Veronica used to bring him to play when she was a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, before he was recognized by the Reed family, Veronica would use her pocket money to bring him here to play a few small games and have a small ice cream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, she said to him, "Mason, you see, if there's anything that makes you unhappy, just come here and you'll be very happy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, he would feel happy when he looked at her smiling face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was her who taught him what warmth, happiness, and emotions are.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the car stopped in front of the amusement park, Veronica looked at Mason with surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason said, 'Veronica said that if you're feeling unhappy, just come here and you'll feel happy, right?'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica paused for a moment, "You remember?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is something she said to him a long time ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I remember everything Veronica said," Mason said.</p></div>
