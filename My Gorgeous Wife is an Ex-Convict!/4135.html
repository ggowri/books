        <h1>Chapter 4133</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After following his father back, he learned that his father had brought him, his illegitimate child, back because his father's wife couldn't conceive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Another reason for bringing him back was that his face looked good!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This appearance will be somewhat useful in the future." These were the exact words his father had said before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">From then on, every time he failed to complete his father's orders, he would be beaten. However, his father never hit his face because his face was a useful tool to his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even his claustrophobia was developed because he disobeyed his father's orders and was locked in a small, dark closet. He eventually passed out in the closet and woke up in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the doctor announced that he had developed claustrophobia as a result, his father showed no remorse on his face. He just looked down on him and said, "Don't disobey me again. You should know the consequences!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It seemed like his father only wanted to teach him a lesson, without caring about the consequences it would have on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was at that moment that he fully understood that his father didn't care about him as a son, but only saw him as a tool!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, his father's actions were just making him face the reality again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He would never go back to the poverty-stricken life where he was constantly bullied!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He initially chose to enter the entertainment industry because he could better utilize his face to earn more money, just to improve his own life, right?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina... the Stephenson family...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had to follow his father's words, or else everything he had worked for until now would be in vain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He cannot escape his father's influence even now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for him and Tina... they should both be getting what they need.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He can fulfill Tina's idol fantasies, no matter what she asks for, he can fulfill it, and Tina agrees to his requests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So he doesn't need to feel guilty about anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He is just selling his face once again, but this time the buyer is Tina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next day, Eugenia still feels a lingering fear from what happened last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Luckily, the elevator malfunctioned yesterday, and neither you nor Kit were harmed! When I found out the elevator wasn't coming up, and I couldn't reach you on the phone, and the emergency contact device in the elevator was also malfunctioning, I can't even describe how scared I was, I was sweating all over!" Eugenia said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You went through a lot, today I'll treat you to a big meal to help you relax!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eugenia was delighted, "You promised!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah, whatever you want to eat, just let me know!" Tina smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eugenia took out her phone and started browsing through those popular restaurants, to see if there were any that interested her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"By the way, when you and Kit got out of the elevator yesterday, Kit looked quite pale, nothing happened in the elevator, right?" Eugenia curiously asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because of what happened last night, there were still a lot of questions left unanswered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina thought about Kit's condition in the elevator at that time, "Something did happen."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What happened?" Eugenia perked up her ears, with a gossipy look on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I can't disclose that!" Tina said, after all, Kit's claustrophobia is his privacy, she naturally wouldn't tell anyone about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though Eugenia is her good friend, she also doesn't want to easily talk about Kit's privacy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eugenia's eyes flickered as she teased, "Wow, Tina, are you doing something unspeakable to our Kit in the elevator? Can you justify it to your Chandler?"</p></div>
