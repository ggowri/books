        <h1>Chapter 3957</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finding out which hospital Nancy was in, Mick hurriedly rushed downstairs to drive there, but he found that his hands were trembling slightly. With hands like this, he might not even be able to hold the steering wheel steady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Mick had the driver take him to the hospital. Along the way, his heart was in turmoil, and a strange feeling kept spreading from his chest to his whole body. It was as if his heart was constantly sinking, and every flow of blood made his body even colder. What was this feeling?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it fear? Fear for Nancy's safety, fear that her injuries were too severe? Or even fear that she...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He almost didn't dare to think further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a time when he would never have imagined feeling this kind of fear for someone who wasn't even a family member.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he arrived at the hospital, he saw Nancy lying on a hospital bed with bandages on her head. The police officer who had called him was in the room, and when he saw Mick, he approached him and asked, "Are you Nancy's friend, Mr. Reed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I am," Mick replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy hasn't been able to give a statement yet because she's still unconscious. However, the other party involved in the accident said that Nancy suddenly rushed in front of her car, causing the accident. Since there were no surveillance cameras at the scene, please inform the police when Nancy wakes up so that we can take her statement," the officer said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I understand," Mick said. "But I want to know who the other party involved in the accident is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's Clarissa. The two of them used to be stepsisters, and the accident happened not far from the Schultz family's house," the police officer said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, a form was handed to Mick for him to fill out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This ordinary form was mainly for Mick to fill in his name, contact information, and home address.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Mick finished filling it out and handed it back, the recipient looked at the form and seemed surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there anything else?" Mick asked impatiently. He needed to find out about Nancy's condition from the doctor!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Being in a coma can be a serious matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially since she was only in a regular hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, everything's fine!" the police officer quickly said before leaving the hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the room, the police officer couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick... this Mr. Reed, was actually the eldest son of the Reed family, the richest family in Emerald City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Nancy's phone contact only showed the name "Mr. Reed."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it wasn't for the address he provided, they might have thought it was just a coincidence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police had also investigated Nancy's background during the hour since they received the report.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was originally the stepdaughter of the Schultz family, but now she wasn't even that. She worked at a hotel and had an ordinary job.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who would have thought that such an ordinary woman could make a phone call to the eldest son of the Reed family and have him rush to the hospital so quickly?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were to reveal this, it would probably be a shocking news story in Emerald City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after, the doctors and nurses moved Nancy to the best room in the hospital and explained her condition to Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick remained cold-faced as the doctor cautiously explained the situation, barely daring to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To the doctor, Nancy's condition seemed like a normal coma with some concussion, but nothing too serious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Mr. Reed's expression made it seem like the patient had a serious illness!</span></p></div>
