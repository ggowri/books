        <h1>Chapter 2976</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian put away his phone, her cheerful voice still echoing in his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He even wanted to hear more of her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'm leaving now," Brian stood up and said to Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was taken aback, "Hey, you're leaving already?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else? Are you going to accompany me to pick up Valda after work?" Brian asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Patrick was speechless once again. Well, he decided to not ask anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian left the private room, and Patrick looked at the unopened bottle of alcohol. It seems that today, he will be drinking alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian drove to the building of Valda's studio and saw Valda waiting at the entrance when he arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you come down? You can wait for me up there," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda smiled and said, "I just wanted to see you earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This sentence, like a coquettish gesture, made Brian's lips curl up with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two got on the car and Brian asked, "Do you want to eat anything? It's a good time for a late-night snack."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's eyes lit up instantly. Speaking of it, she hasn't had supper for a long time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So... how about we go eat some crawfish?" she suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Crayfish?" He furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you not like to eat?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's just..." he hesitated for a moment and said, "I haven't eaten it before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was momentarily confused, but soon she began to understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, food items like crayfish are popular among common people, but they are rarely found in formal meals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about you try something new today?" Valda suggested. "I know of a great street vendor that serves delicious crawfish. It's ranked number one on the foodie list for crawfish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she said this, her eyes were shining, which made Brian find her extremely cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, let's go to the place you mentioned and try it out," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda quickly took out her phone and started using the navigation app.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian followed the directions and arrived at the destination, which was an old-fashioned food stall. The tables and chairs were old, and the sign looked like it had been there for years. However, there were many people here, and the tables were already full. Some customers were even sitting on small stools outside the shop waiting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda felt a bit embarrassed and asked, "Do you want to wait here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since we're already here, we might as well wait," Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda breathed a sigh of relief and smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After they sat down, Brian asked, "Do you come here often?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not really, but I come a few times a year to satisfy my cravings. When I was in college, Camille and I used to come here a lot, but we didn't have much money, so we only ordered a small portion and nothing else," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking back to those days, she still felt warm inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was also one of the few warm moments she experienced during her college years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Afterwards, if you want to come here, I'll accompany you. You can come as many times as you want," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda paused, "But you're not used to this kind of place, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's nothing special about it, I don't have any particular habits. I'm not someone who can only dine in fancy restaurants," said Brian.</p></div>
