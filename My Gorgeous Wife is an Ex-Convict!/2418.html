        <h1>Chapter 2416</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way he looked at her was so gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could she not love him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the Barlow family's mansion, Philip Barlow came to his son's room. His eyes glimmered when he saw his son focusing on the sleeping Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you like Jasper very much?" Philip Barlow asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William continued looking intently at the person beside him. He did not answer as if there was no need to answer the question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you should know that she&rsquo;s the heiress of the Reed family. There will be many people who will like her in the future." Wealth had always been tempting. Besides, Jasper was good-looking and charming. A girl like that would never lack suitors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The look on William's face changed. He looked up at his father. "Even if there are many people who like her, I&rsquo;ll make sure Jasper only likes me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But are you sure you're capable of that?" Philip Barlow smiled. "You're young. She has limited contact with people and limited play pals. Among the people she has met, you&rsquo;re the only one who can play the piano with her and listen to her. It's why she likes you, but what about the future? What if she meets someone who plays the piano better than you and listens to her better than you? Maybe she'll like them better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William's tiny body instantly tensed, and his little face looked grave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Will Jasper... like other people more?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you only want to cater to her and do whatever she wants you to do, you can be replaced one day because it's not that hard to do both. If that&rsquo;s the case, how long do you think she'll like you?" Philip Barlow's voice was like thunder, leaving one mark after another on his son&rsquo;s heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William bit his lip, and his face began to turn pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow felt a little heartbroken seeing his son like this. If the two elderly knew he was saying such things to their grandson, they would probably give him a good scolding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... he was going to tell his son anyway even if the words were too harsh and realistic for a six-year-old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His son's feelings for Jasper were too deep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought their separation would weaken his son's feelings, but it seemed to have the opposite effect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How do I make her keep liking me?" The little one managed to squeeze the words out after a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have to better yourself. Be better than everyone else. Be so good that she won't be able to look away from you. Maybe only then will she continue to like you, and you can have the result you want," said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many rich families would want to marry the Reed family's heiress. The Barlow family only gave William a qualification.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The rest depended on his son's own achievements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he going to be increasingly remarkable or average?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William was silent. After a long pause, he said, "I'll become someone remarkable. I&rsquo;ll work hard to learn everything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow said, "Well then, you'll need to cut back on your piano practice time and learn more about other things. I'll hire a teacher for you. Alright, go to sleep, or it's going to be pointless if you're sleepy when Jasper wakes up tomorrow."</p></div>
