        <h1>Chapter 3171</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After leaving the Hart family, Valda sat in the passenger seat and watched the scenery recede along the way, thinking about everything that had happened at the Hart family today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Old Mr. and Mrs. Hart, along with Brian, were told by Lexi to never come back to the Hart family again because of the things she said. This effectively severed their familial relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is it making a mountain out of a molehill? Actually, they are doing it to protect her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This warmth made her feel heavy in her chest!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked at Valda sitting silently in the car, and a hint of sadness flickered in his phoenix-like eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car arrived at the Hart family's mansion. The two got out of the car and walked into the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there anything you want to tell me?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda turned to him with a puzzled look. "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Like, did my mother talk to you about anything today?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She just told me to always be with you no matter what happens," she confessed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course it's true," she said. "Do you think your mother would say anything bad about me? If she did, she wouldn't have helped me establish my authority in front of those relatives today. Brian, I really like your parents."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His worries were somewhat relieved. "What about me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I love you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked slightly moved. "So tell me honestly, are you mad at me today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked surprised. "Why would I be mad at you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because... Grace," he hesitated for a moment, before finally uttering the name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace is someone he used to love, but now he's afraid she might become an obstacle between them. He's afraid Valda might misunderstand and think he doesn't love her enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So when Lexi said something to Valda today about saving Grace's child or something like that, he felt a sudden panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi knows exactly how to stir up trouble, he can almost predict it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once, Valda struggled to believe that he truly loved her, wanted to marry her, and that saving Grace's child had nothing to do with it. But now, Lexi's words could potentially stir up a lot of emotions in Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, I love you and want to marry you. It has nothing to do with Grace," he said hesitantly. "Even though...at first, I started dating you because of Grace, but later on, it wasn't about her anymore. I truly fell in love with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She blinked her eyes and looked at him as he hurriedly explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is he worried and scared again? Is he afraid that she might misunderstand something?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, no matter what Lexi said today or what others may say in the future, just trust me, okay? Trust only what I say!" He continued anxiously, "Trust only my words, trust that I love you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda lifted her hand and gently stroked Brian's cheek. His cheek felt cold, and the contrast with the warmth of her hand was striking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your face is so cold," she murmured. Despite the comfortable temperature, it shouldn't be this cold. Or maybe... is it because of his concern for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body trembled slightly, his thin lips pursed, and the gaze in his phoenix eyes revealed a sense of urgency as Grace waited eagerly for her answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The eyes are filled with an incredibly complex mix of urgency, fear, longing, and worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could she still doubt his love for her when he was a man like this? Was it just out of sympathy, pity, or a desire to repay her for saving Grace's child?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda held Brian's face and stood on her tiptoes to kiss his lips. "I trust you, I trust that you love me! So, Brian, you don't need to worry about me misunderstanding anything. Even though I used to be insecure, not very confident, and doubted your feelings, now...I don't anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, there is no doubt about his love for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he may have truly loved Grace in the past, she is well aware that the person he loves now is her!</p></div>
