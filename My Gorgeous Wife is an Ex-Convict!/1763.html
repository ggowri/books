        <h1>Chapter 1761</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, another explosion rang out not far away from them. Rocks and trees instantly crumbled and burst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian almost instinctively defended Mason and blocked Grace at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A muffled grunt rang in Grace's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you okay? Are you hurt?" Grace asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian's face paled a little before saying with a faint smile, "I'm fine. Let's get down the hill first!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, his expression changed as soon as he got up. The ground beneath him was sinking...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The explosion earlier had caused the ground to collapse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian threw Mason into Grace's arms and pushed Grace to safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Everything happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next moment, Brian found himself falling. 'Am I... going to die in a place like this? I never thought I'd die this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But... if I manage to save Grace, then a death like this doesn't seem too bad!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she fell into the sea, all he had felt was regret for not being there for her and not saving her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This time, as if to make up for his regret, God had let him appear here by coincidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian slowly closed his eyes and waited for death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, a strong grip on his wrist stopped him from falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'This feeling...' Brian instantly opened his eyes only to see five thin fingers gripping his wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was... Grace hand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he was too heavy. There was no way for her to pull him up with her strength alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Bri Brian, hurry... Hurry and grab my hand. My fingers... don't have much strength and I can't hold on for long," Grace said with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Due to her old and new injuries over the years, her fingers were akin to deadwood. Brian could tell he was a heavy burden to her hand when she tried to pull his falling body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian looked blankly at the face that was contorted from the pain. He had learned from Dr. Russell how seriously injured her hands were. Dr. Russell even said that she had better not lift any heavy objects before her hands recovered. However, her hand was now bearing the weight of his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian said, "Grace, enough! Let go, or the place you're standing now will collapse too! Aren't you here to save your son? Then take your son and get down the hill immediately!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace shouted, "I can't do that! Grab... Grab onto me! Hang in there. Jay will come and save us. Just hold on till Jay gets here. Hold on a little longer!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Brian still did not grab Grace's hand. "Do you really believe Jason will come? The explosions aren&rsquo;t done yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, Jay... will be here," she said without the slightest hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian laughed bitterly. "The old Jason would have come, but he forgot you before this, didn't he? Would he take such a risk now?"</p></div>
