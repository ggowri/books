        <h1>Chapter 1228</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had barely finished when he interrupted her, "Don't even think about getting a divorce! Never in this life! You'll only be my wife, and your husband will only be me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned, and when it was time for them to recite their vows on stage, Grace was still a little out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not until she began to recite the wedding vows that she came back to her senses bit by bit. Somehow, she seemed to feel that Jason's voice was not as cold as it was just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if... there were more emotions in it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"From this day onward, we&rsquo;re voluntarily married as husband and wife, sharing the responsibilities and obligations of matrimony..." Grace recited word by word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'From now on, I'm truly stuck with the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I finally have a family of my own, and one day soon, I'll have a child of my own. No matter how difficult the future is, will I go through it together with him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can we love each other forever?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Forever&hellip; What a wonderful word, but I'll need a lifetime to achieve it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Anyway, I think I'll try... I'll try to make this marriage work and keep this family. I&rsquo;ll try not to make myself regret it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Today's vows will last a lifetime." The last vow escaped their mouths.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After they finished reciting, the staff presented Grace and Jason with two marriage licenses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at the marriage license in her hand, and she heard Jason whisper, "From now on, we&rsquo;re husband and wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," muttered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes. From now on, we&rsquo;re husband and wife!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace's hand and walked toward the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman who talked to Grace earlier had just finished taking photos for her marriage license. As soon as she came out, she saw the managing director and the other staff watching Jason and Grace leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman could not help but guess again. 'Is he Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If not, does the staff of tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau need to be so serious?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you looking at?" the woman's soon-to-be husband beside her asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No-Nothing." As she spoke, the woman's phone rang. The woman looked at the caller ID. It was her friend who was the entertainment reporter, the one whom she had asked about the photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she answered the call, she heard her friend shouting over the phone, "Oh my God! Who&rsquo;s that man you just took a photo of? My Twitter account was immediately suspended as soon as I uploaded his photo to my Twitter!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At first, she thought she could stir up some topics by using the man&rsquo;s resemblance to Jason. Who knew her account was suspended ten minutes after she uploaded it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she spent a lot of effort and money managing the account!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was taken aback when she heard this. After a long pause, she said, "Do you think this man may be... Jason?"</p></div>
