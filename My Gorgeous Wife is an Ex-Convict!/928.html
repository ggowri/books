        <h1>Chapter 927</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," Grace replied with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that things were going better than she thought, and she was about to get hard evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Baldwin could get his compensation if they could prove that the actress Elise Dean was the real culprit and prevent her from transferring her assets in time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt a lot better as she thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Within ten minutes, she saw a simple white van coming her way before pulling up in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The door opened. Instead of getting out, a man in sunglasses and a cap asked Grace, "You must be Always Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace glanced at the driver. He was also wearing the same cap and sunglasses. He even wore a face mask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With an instinctive sense of crisis, she took a step back, and the next moment, the man who had asked her the question suddenly grabbed her. He pulled her into the van and slammed the door shut.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go!" the man said to the driver at the front as he grabbed Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver stepped on the gas pedal and started driving forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace struggled. She had underestimated the human heart after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This place doesn&rsquo;t have any surveillance cameras. They... probably know this. That's why they dare to do this.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This b*tch. Let's teach her a lesson so that she'll behave!" the driver in the front row said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can I touch her? It's been a long time since I touched a woman!" said the man who was holding Grace down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, but don't kill her. The higher-ups told us to keep her hospitalized for some time," said the driver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The higher-ups? Which higher-up?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man on top of her had begun to tug at her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Grace struggled for her life, her hands were tied by the man with a hemp rope. She was slapped in the face several times with blood oozing from the corners of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can give you money if you were hired to do this!" Grace tried to calm herself down. She could only save herself by staying calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Money? How much money does a mere paralegal like you have?" he sneered, not taking Grace's words seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I may be a mere paralegal, but my backup has money. If you inquire about it at my law firm, you'll know that these days... Uh, there's always a Maybach picking me up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was deliberately ambiguous with her speech. There had been rumors that were hinting that she was having an affair with a rich man these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not pay any attention to it because mere gossip could not hurt her at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man who held her had a change of ideas. "How much can you give us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How much do you want?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you give us ten million?" the man asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I'll have to call my benefactor. I don't have the money, but he does!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think?" the man asked the driver at the front.</p></div>
