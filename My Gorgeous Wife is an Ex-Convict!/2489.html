        <h1>Chapter 2487</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Guilt flickered in Louise Mitchell's eyes, but she said calmly, "It really has nothing to do with me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory stared at Louise Mitchell intently. The next moment, he raised his hand and grabbed Louise Mitchell's hand before pulling up her middle finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if realizing something, Louise Mitchell immediately shouted, "No, George. I'm your wife! Would you rather believe the woman who betrayed you than me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Louise Mitchell soon gave a piercing wail. Sounds of bones cracking rang out. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her middle finger had been snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it hurt?" George Gregory asked indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell covered her right hand, "Why... Why? I'm your wife! And she... she's the one who betrayed you. Did you break my finger for her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell shouted with grief and anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She betrayed me, but that doesn't mean you can cut off her finger like that. Your pain isn't a tenth of what she suffered then. If it isn&rsquo;t because you&rsquo;re my wife, do you think you&rsquo;ll still be able to keep this finger?&rdquo; George Gregory said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell shivered suddenly. He had never forgotten Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you believe everything she says? How dare you treat me like this for her? I'm the one who loves you with all my heart!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you think I didn't check before I came? The subordinates who were with you when you cut off her finger have confessed to everything," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's heart sank. "I only wanted to help you out. A woman like her isn&rsquo;t worthy to wear the ring you gave her!&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory looked coldly at the woman screaming in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was no emotion in his heart no matter how pained her expression was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He... did not love this woman because the one he loved... was Amber Mitchell, the woman who betrayed him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I gave her the ring. Even if she doesn't deserve it, I should be the one to take it back. I didn&rsquo;t need you to meddle in this. Besides, she was still my fianc&eacute;e when you cut off her finger. Who gave you the right to cut off her finger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked condescendingly at her. There was not the slightest heartache and reluctance in his cold eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gaze made Louise Mitchell feel like freezing water had drenched her from head to toe, making her feel cold all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's so good about Amber Mitchell? Why are you still obsessed with her when she has betrayed you like that? Why do you despise me when I love you wholeheartedly?" Louise Mitchell shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even he wanted to ask himself why... he was still obsessed with Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the following days, news broke online that the doctors who diagnosed Amber Mitchell as mentally ill had been detained by the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police were investigating the case further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the police did not release any further information about the situation, it was all over the internet. Many of them pointed their fingers at the Mitchell family.</p></div>
