        <h1>Chapter 3806</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean it's not? As long as I can see you in pain, I won't withdraw my lawsuit!" Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy is definitely not normal! Veronica said, "Well, then you'll be disappointed. Since you're not planning to talk properly, I'm leaving!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she walked towards the door, but when her hand was about to touch the doorknob, her other hand pressed against the door to prevent her from opening it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daniel, you--" Veronica was about to turn around and scold him, but Daniel's other hand held a square handkerchief and covered her mouth and nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is... Veronica was shocked and struggled desperately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Daniel firmly held the handkerchief over her mouth and nose and refused to let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt her strength gradually fading and her consciousness becoming increasingly blurred. Finally, her vision went black and she fainted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only at this moment that Daniel let go of her and looked at the unconscious </span><span>Veronica, twistedly saying, "The real show is just beginning! Veronica, how desperate will you be when you realize that Mason has abandoned you?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Veronica woke up, her eyes were covered with a black cloth. Even if she opened her eyes, everything around her was pitch black.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She instinctively tried to move her body, but then realized that she was tied up like a dumpling and couldn't move at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's going on? How did this happen? Where am I now?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of questions exploded in her mind. Then, she suddenly remembered that before she passed out, she was at Daniel's house and was trying to leave when he covered her mouth and nose with a handkerchief. After that...she couldn't remember anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daniel?" Veronica spoke up. Although she was bound and blindfolded, her mouth was not covered and she could still speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Here," Daniel's voice echoed in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica pursed her lips. Even if she was slow, she could understand that she had been kidnapped by Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You never really wanted to talk about dropping the lawsuit with me, did you?" Veronica asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel suddenly chuckled, "Your reaction is quite unexpected. I thought you would scream and cry, but I didn't expect you to have the leisure to ask me this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If screaming and crying won't make you release me, why waste the effort?" Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're so smart, why don't you guess what I want to do?" Daniel taunted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica knew that Daniel, at this moment, was not normal in terms of cognition and mental state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to think that Daniel was just too stubborn, but now it seemed that he was a bit paranoid and delusional.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not trying to use me to threaten Mason, are you?" Veronica said. She figured that Daniel hated Mason the most, so it wasn't hard to guess his motive for kidnapping her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're right. I want to see how good your relationship with Mason really is!" Daniel's voice was sinister and close to Veronica. She felt like he was standing right in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're trying to test my relationship with him, then you'll be disappointed," Veronica said. "We've already broken up. Even if he knows I've been kidnapped, he'll only help me report to the police. He won't risk his life for me."</span></p></div>
