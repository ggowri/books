        <h1>Chapter 477</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you saying, Mom? Grace brought her boyfriend here today. How would we dare bully her? We even have to call her boyfriend Mister," Third Aunt took the opportunity to quip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grandma was surprised. "Boyfriend? Grace has a boyfriend now? Quick, let me meet him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll bring him here then," said Grace as she got up and walked out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt said somewhat unhappily, "What are you so happy about, Mom? Grace's boyfriend looks like a toy boy. He might even be a fraud!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In short, she did not want her niece to find a good boyfriend and one up her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough. Grace is a cautious kid. She's not someone who would lose her head over someone&rsquo;s words. I'll see if he's a fraud!" said Grace's grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt pursed her lips. Grandma looked at Jason as Grace led him into the room. She said with a smile, "You're Grace's boyfriend, aren't you? What's your name?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was about to help Jason introduce himself when the latter opened his mouth and replied, "My last name is Reed. You can call me Jason, Grandma."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was some kind of respectful humility in Jason's voice; it surprised Grace a little. At least under normal circumstances, Grace had not heard Jason talk to other people in the same tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason? Good. I'll call you that then," Grandma said with a smile. "Grace is a good kid, but she has suffered a lot. You must treat her well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I will. She's the only person I've ever wanted in my life. I wouldn't choose anyone else over her," Jason said earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace started to blush slightly. She tugged at Jason's sleeve, trying to hint to him not to be too direct. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what her grandmother said next was even blunter. "Are you going to marry Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grandma asked this, her muddy eyes suddenly became sharp. It was as if she wanted to see the man more clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Jason replied bluntly, "I'll marry her if she's willing to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To him, she was the only woman in his life that he would marry or... wanted to marry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, he wanted to!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He really wanted to!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she said yes now, he would marry her at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face immediately turned red. On the other hand, Grandma only gave a little laugh and shifted her gaze to Grace. "Grace has good taste to have found a boyfriend like Jay. I look forward to your wedding reception."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was speechless. Wedding reception&hellip; Uh, Grandma was thinking too far ahead. She and Jason had only just started dating!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Grace could not help but imagine her marrying Jay...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not&hellip; not so fast, Grandma!" stuttered Grace.</p></div>
