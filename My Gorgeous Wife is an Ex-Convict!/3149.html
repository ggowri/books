        <h1>Chapter 3147</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And when Valda found out that the stock price of Hart Group had fallen the next day, she fell silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She never expected that this would cause a drop in the stock price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, fluctuations in stock prices are normal. You don't really believe that there are stocks that only go up and never go down, do you?" Brian comforted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I certainly know that stock prices fluctuate, but now that the stock price is falling, it's because..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You, don't take all the responsibility on yourself," said Brian. "Believe me, if I said I can settle this matter in three days, then I can definitely do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mmm, I believe you," she replied, but after this time, there will still be a next time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If we can't completely dispel all these rumors and gossip this time, then we're just postponing the issue and it may resurface again someday in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She doesn't want to be just the protected one, she also wants to protect the people she loves!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, there should be surveillance footage at my exhibition that day," Valda suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian squinted his eyes slightly and asked, "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So when I fell down and Tracy and her friends prevented me from getting up, there should have been surveillance footage of it," she said. "If we can retrieve that footage, then some of the rumors will naturally be debunked."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if I don't release this video, it doesn't matter. I will suppress these rumors!" Brian said. In fact, he had obtained the video on the second day of the incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the video, Valda is being harassed by someone. Even though her face is blurry and her expressions cannot be seen, he doesn't want to expose her embarrassed appearance to the public just to clear up a lie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That lie, he has the ability to suppress it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But even though it's been suppressed this time, who knows what might happen next time? This issue might be brought up again," said Valda. "There's nothing more powerful than that video surveillance, and Tracy probably thinks that we won't make it public, which is why she dared to do this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian pursed his lips slightly and said, "But if it were made public, you might feel more..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you being laughed at?" Valda asked, "I've already prepared myself mentally, I'm not afraid. Perhaps I'll face even more ridicule in the future. If I can't handle it now, how will I be able to live my life in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her determined gaze finally eased the tension in his heart that had been tight all along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you really sure you want to do this?" he asked softly, reassuring her that he would support whatever decision she made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I've decided," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Valda went live online, which surprised many onlookers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh my god, she's actually live streaming?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you really Brian's fianc&eacute;e?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Goodness, she's so ugly. How did she become the prince's fianc&eacute;e?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're a scheming woman. Tracy didn't help you up, so you let Brian ban her. Disgusting!"</p></div>
