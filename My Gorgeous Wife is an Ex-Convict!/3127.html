        <h1>Chapter 3125</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, Brian found a restaurant and Valda brought up the topic of house hunting for the day. "We saw a new house today, it's in the same building as Amber's, but I saw a unit on the first floor while Amber saw one on the ninth floor. Amber also told me about the neighborhood and I think it's pretty good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to buy that house?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have an idea. I'll ask the agent to negotiate a lower price first. Then, you and Camille can go together to take a look at the house for me," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," he said, lowering his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she buys the house, it means she will take in Lisa, who saved her life. That also means he can't live with her after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he was extremely grateful to Lisa, the thought of possibly being unable to get closer to her made him feel even more confused and uncertain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I don't know how to get closer to her, or what he should do to help her let go of this emotional burden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All he can do now is to persistently pursue her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he thought of this, he couldn't help but feel a sense of self-mockery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He, who had once despised such persistent pursuit, had now resorted to it himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this was Valda... the Valda he couldn't let go of no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda watched as Brian ate his food with his head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had rushed over so hastily just because she had interrupted their phone call. And when he arrived and hugged her, that trembling feeling seemed to still linger in her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This man cared so much about her. Why did she still doubt that his feelings for her were only out of pity?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda, are you really that lacking in confidence? She murmured to herself in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she continued to feel inferior because of her limp, both she and Brian would suffer in the end. So why not take that step forward?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if the outcome was not good, it would only be as painful as it is now. But what if the result was good?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she stopped here, she would definitely regret it in a few years. She would regret being too insecure and lacking the courage to take this step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian," she softly called his name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" He slightly raised his head, and his phoenix eyes looked straight at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I love you." These three words, spoken from her mouth, also represented her determination at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She decided to let go of her insecurity. Even though she had a disability, as long as he loved her, she would be with him. No matter how big the storms in the future, she would bravely face them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian was stunned, and then his phoenix eyes burst with an incredulous light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, what did you say?" He was a little excited and cautious, afraid that things were not as he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, I love you, so let's get married, okay?" She asked, wanting to form a family with him, wanting to have children for him, and wanting to be with him forever and ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her in a daze, and the next moment, two lines of clear tears slid down his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's get married!" He said hoarsely, excitedly taking her hand and kissing it, sprinkling kisses on her hand and fingertips... "Valda, we're getting married, I, Brian, am going to marry Valda!"</p></div>
