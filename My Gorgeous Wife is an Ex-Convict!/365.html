        <h1>Chapter 364</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;He just asked me where you are and I said you&rsquo;re in the kitchen, so he just glanced at the kitchen.&rdquo; Mrs. Corbyn asked curiously, &ldquo;Who is that person? Do you know him?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, when her daughter saw him, she immediately ran away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a complex look on Kyla Corbyn&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Brian. He&rsquo;s the young master of the entertainment industry. When I was&hellip; with that person, I saw him a few times.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Will he recognize you?&rdquo; Mrs. Corbyn asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid&hellip; he did.&rdquo; Even though she looked completely different than how she looked before, if Brian had not recognized her, he would not have asked that before he left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;Then&hellip; What should we do? Will he tell that person about this? I think he knows Grace. Why don&rsquo;t we ask Grace to help talk to him for us?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn bit her lip. She was also puzzled right now. She thought Brian had wandered into her shop unintentionally, but now, it seemed like he was waiting for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However&hellip; a young master from the entertainment industry and a delivery person from a little restaurant&hellip; The difference was too big.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace returned, Kyla Corbyn asked, &ldquo;Grace, do you know Brian?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Kyla, you know him?&rdquo; Grace was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn smiled forcefully. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t that young master have some scandals? A few of his girlfriends are actresses in the entertainment industry. His pictures are all over the internet.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I guess I know him. I&rsquo;ve met him a few times,&rdquo; Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then you and him&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing between us,&rdquo; she said. Then, when she saw that Kyla Corbyn was still shocked, she said, &ldquo;Kyla, if there&rsquo;s nothing else, I&rsquo;ll go deliver my things.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; Kyla Corbyn pressed her lips together. It seemed like she had to go and look for Brian herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence watched as his boss drank the Chinese medicine. He had a few questions in his heart. Usually, Young Master Reed would not even eat Western medicine. Now, he was drinking Chinese medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence figured this sudden change in his boss must have something to do with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, his boss had been trying a lot of things for the first time because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Jason finished his medicine, he frowned. Then, he drank a glass of water to wash away the taste of Chinese medicine in his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he did not like taking medicine, if she wanted him to nurse his body, he would listen to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Do you know what I should do to make a woman like me?&rdquo; Jason asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence was shocked. Was this&hellip; Young Master Reed&rsquo;s question? How to make a woman like him? Um&hellip; If it was Young Master Reed, women would flock to him even if he did not do anything. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence pondered for a while before asking carefully, &ldquo;Young Master Reed, do you mean&hellip; Miss Cummins?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at Terrence indifferently but did not deny it.</p></div>
