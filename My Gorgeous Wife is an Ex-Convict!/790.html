        <h1>Chapter 789</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However&hellip;' Grace lowered her head and looked at her flat stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I might never have children of my own. In the past, it was because of my body that I thought I was unable to give birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now, my body may heal, but I've been physically and mentally exhausted that I no longer have the courage to believe in the so-called love!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got to the small restaurant, and it was already past seven o&lsquo;clock. She had avoided the dinner rush hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There you are!" When Kyla saw Grace, she immediately went up to her. Looking at her gaunt face, she asked, "Have you eaten? Why don't you eat something at my place?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought about it and said, "Then give me a bowl of noodles. I haven't had that for a long time." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, wait a minute," said Kyla before ordering the kitchen staff to do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before long, a bowl of noodles with lots of ingredients appeared. "Eat. Think of it as we&rsquo;re celebrating your birthday a day later!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Grace as she lowered her head and began to eat the noodles quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla did not bother her anymore and greeted the other customers. She cleaned up and went on with the restaurant's chores.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace finished her noodles, Kyla sat down at the table again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened yesterday? Did something happen to you?" Kyla asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, something happened. I broke up with Jason and have now moved out of Reed Residence," Grace said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After one night, she could now speak about it calmly. She thought she could put the relationship behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was shocked when she heard about it. Grace's calm manner made her feel sorry for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had also experienced dating. How could she not know the pain? If it was true love, how could breaking up be so... peaceful?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her current calmness was nothing but the repression of her pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla did not know what to say to Grace when she was like this! After all, she was a loser in love herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At such times, she did not know what comfort she could offer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps only time could really heal all this pain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, Kyla. I'm not as weak as you think!" Grace saw the worry in Kyla's eyes and tried her best to bring a smile to her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, this is the cake I bought for Nelson. I didn't have a chance to treat him to cake yesterday. Please take this cake to him first. I'll take him to the amusement park when I'm free someday and treat him to a bigger cake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson will be happy to hear that. He was even going to give you the birthday present he chose for you," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, you're so lucky to have such an adorable child as Nelson," Grace could not help saying with admiration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I feel lucky too." Mentioning her son, gentleness flashed in Kyla's eyes. Her relationship with Martin Weiss had hurt her to the bone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was enough for her to have Nelson in her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In this life, she only wanted to grow old with her son by her side!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace left, Kyla looked at the time. It was almost closing time, so she cleaned up the restaurant, closed the doors and windows, and pulled down the shutters. Taking the box of cake that Grace wanted her to give Nelson, she turned around when she suddenly received a great shock.</p></div>
