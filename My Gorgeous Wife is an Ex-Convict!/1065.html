        <h1>Chapter 1064</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I told you. I have no&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have no feelings for me?" he interrupted her, "Who do you have feelings for now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned. Danger seemed to flicker in his eyes as he looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have no feelings for anyone, including Brian!" she said. She did not want to involve Brian in this. Jason broke Brian's wrist because of her, and she wondered how he was doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why let him hug you if you have no feelings for him? When did he and you get along so well?" he asked darkly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly felt nervous. If her answer annoyed him, then maybe&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said truthfully, "I&hellip; only think of Brian as a childhood friend. I&hellip; feel guilty when I see him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Guilty?" Jason raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He has been looking for me for years, but I never told him I&rsquo;m the one he&rsquo;s looking for." Instead, she let Brian identify the wrong person and make the mistake again and again. "Besides, he probably hugged me because of the feelings he had as a child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was wearing a purple gown, so Brian probably saw her as the little girl in his imagination. She could feel it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the hug was just between Bryn and the child version of herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He straightened up slightly. He put his hands on the edge of the bed, looked at her, and said, "Okay. Since you say you have no feelings for Brian, I believe you. What about me? Is it that hard for you to fall in love with me again?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their faces were suddenly very close to each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared blankly at him. The man in front of him had a handsome face. He had a plump forehead, angular features, a straight nose, and thin sexy lips. The eyes beneath his straight brows were fierce yet seductive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These eyes could give people an oppressive chill but were also charming enough to make one lose their mind. It was as if his eyes could even capture somebody&rsquo;s soul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How hard it was to not fall for a man like him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There would have been many women around him if he had not been so harsh with them and if bad things did not happen to some of the women who approached him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fall in love with me, won't you? Wouldn't it be great to be together like how we used to? I'll dote on you and spoil you. I can give you whatever you want. I&rsquo;ll never break up with you or hurt you again," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Never had a man like him been so abject with a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was an exception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could let go of his pride and insistence just to regain her love!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only found it amusing. After breaking up, she tried hard to forget the man, but now, he was begging her to love him again with such a tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She muttered, "Jason, do you understand love? If you can easily decide who to love by will, then it's not love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gave a wry smile as she stared at him with those almond-shaped eyes of hers. "Just like now. Even if I can say I love you, my heart doesn't love you at all. Is that the answer you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could not easily decide who to love by will. He knew this&hellip; better than ever. If he could decide for himself, he would not have chosen to love her.</p></div>
