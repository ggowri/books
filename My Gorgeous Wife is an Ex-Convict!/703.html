        <h1>Chapter 702</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, Jason wrapped his arms around Grace from behind. His lips pressed close to her ear while his breathing was fragrant like an orchid as he said, "You're so beautiful, Sis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face reddened immediately. The shop's staff was here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let&hellip; Let go! Someone's watching!" she muttered, her face beginning to burn again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what? We're a couple. Isn't it natural for us to hug each other?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help looking up into the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face in the mirror was full of shame, and she had sunk into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His black suit and her silver gown made a sharp contrast and a strong visual impact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her eyes met his in the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Both were looking in the mirror before them, and their eyes were intertwined through the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared somewhat blankly at Jason through the mirror. His jaw touched her shoulders. His short black hair and his bangs were brushed back, showing his full forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His bright peach blossom eyes seemed to be endlessly flirting with her at the moment. His sexy thin lips opened and closed below his high nose bridge as he said, "You're really beautiful, Sis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face turned even redder, though he had said this so softly that only they could hear each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was just worried that the staff around them might hear it too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, I'll restrain myself from thinking about you, but Sis, you have to make it up to me," he murmured, his thin lips brushing past her delicate neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt as if she was about to be on fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The staff around them were dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that Young Master Reed, who was known for being indifferent and sexually restrained, would be so intimate with a woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was even some kind of deep longing in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyone could tell that Young Master Reed was probably crazy about Miss Cummins!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The female staff was even more envious of Grace now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When it came to choosing the jewelry to match the gown, Jason chose a set of ruby jewelry worth 50 million dollars for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's too expensive," said Grace. Besides, she probably would not wear the jewelry much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You deserve even the most expensive items," Jason said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that when it came to her, he could not help but give her the best and the most expensive items.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to be nice to her, to make up for what she had suffered as much as he could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he could use all his power and money to make up for it, but he could not turn back time or truly eliminate what he had done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, Grace sat on the edge of the bed, looking at the note in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the contact information Dr. Guzman had given her about a psychiatrist. However, she could not make up her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she met Stella today, she had deliberately asked her if Brian really promised to give her a purple dress when he was younger. Although Stella tried hard to hide her expression and pretend to be calm, Grace somehow got an inkling from her cousin&rsquo;s reaction.</p></div>
