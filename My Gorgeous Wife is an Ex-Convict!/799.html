        <h1>Chapter 798</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason unexpectedly stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence was dumbstruck. 'Was what I just said... that useful?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason just lowered his head and looked at his hands that were stained with blood. He remembered her saying that his hands were beautiful and clean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's just... She didn't know how much blood and how much of the world's darkness have stained my hands.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it'll make my hands dirty..." muttered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Reed, your hands..." Terrence hurriedly handed over a clean handkerchief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took the handkerchief and wiped the blood off his hands. Then, as if no longer interested in the man lying on the ground, he walked straight past him and into the building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence quickly gave a few orders and walked into the building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those who had just seen that scene could not help but feel cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that Young Master Reed, who usually looked cold and noble, would be so terrible when he took matters into his own hands? He looked just like&hellip; death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if it did not matter if millions of people died in his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if life meant nothing to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to come in," Jason ordered lightly to Terrence at the president's office's door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!" replied Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason walked into the office alone. Immediately after that, there was a sound in the president's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence, who was standing outside, knew that Young Master Reed's strange behavior and anger today were all because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the two had broken up... it seemed that Grace still had influences on Young Master Reed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's the relationship between Grace and the man standing next to her on the street today? Does Young Master Reed... mind it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, these were answers Terrence would not know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, who was in the president's office, looked at the mess on the floor and slammed his hand on the French window made of toughened glass beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I never really loved anyone?" A somewhat broken voice escaped his mouth little by little, and there was a lingering beauty and fragility on that handsome face!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I hadn't really loved, then I wouldn't be so sad now.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart seemed to be being stabbed again and again by numerous sharp needles, then the pain spread through his body with every beat of the heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why... Why does it hurt so much?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'We've broken up. I've decided not to love any more! However, why is her face still in my mind?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kept thinking about what he had seen today&hellip; The way she smiled at another man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, his heart seemed to become more painful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace arrived at the appointed time at the law firm where she was going to have an interview today.</p></div>
