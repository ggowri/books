        <h1>Chapter 3937</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yesterday evening, when the dispute happened, it was her time to get off work. Therefore, there were naturally many colleagues in the company who either saw the scene with their own eyes or heard about it from others, even if they hadn't seen the video online. So when Nancy came to work, everyone looked at her with strange eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During her break at work, some colleagues gathered around Nancy curiously and asked, "Nancy, we heard that you had a conflict with someone at the hotel entrance yesterday, and a handsome guy helped you. He seemed to have a few followers with him. Other colleagues said he looked like a rich kid. Who was he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just a kind-hearted person," Nancy replied calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come on, tell us who he is. Which rich second-generation is he from?" asked the colleague in a gossipy tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy smiled and remained silent, indicating that she wouldn't say much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The colleague lost interest and muttered disappointedly, "Well, if you don't want to say, forget it. But we're all colleagues here. If you really make it big, don't forget to take care of your old colleagues."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy promised, "Sure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, she still had to work here, and there was no need to offend anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for becoming successful... she didn't hold much hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Mick was only interested in her for a moment, she hoped to use his interest to help her mother get justice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the colleague left, Nancy continued with her work. Suddenly, someone passed by her from behind and bumped into her shoulder heavily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy stumbled and almost fell forward, but managed to regain her balance and not fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person didn't even apologize and just walked past her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, Nancy, are you okay?" Another colleague saw what happened and ran over to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm fine," Nancy said. "Who was that person just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, that's Irene Lynch, the new greeter. She probably accidentally bumped into you just now. She's usually polite," the colleague explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was probably an accident," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her shoulder was still sore from the collision earlier, indicating that Irene's impact was definitely not light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With such forceful impact and no apology afterwards, was it really an accident? Nancy thought to herself. She wasn't the type to be naive and think that everyone was a kind person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a day of work, Nancy always faced curious looks from her colleagues, and her shoulder would occasionally ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After work, she was planning to go to a nearby pharmacy to buy some pain relief cream when a black car stopped directly in front of her. The driver got out and opened the back door for Nancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked into the car and saw Mick. "Mr. Reed, what are you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get in," Mick said from inside the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy pursed her lips and obediently got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The door closed and the car slowly drove away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some colleagues who saw this scene became even more convinced that Nancy had landed herself a wealthy man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although they didn't see the man get out of the car, the car itself was expensive and not something an ordinary person could afford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the shadows not far away, a figure stared at the car as it drove off, biting their lip in anger.</p></div>
