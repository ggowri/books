        <h1>Chapter 3679</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper let Roger hold her like this, "Where do you feel uncomfortable? Should I take you to the hospital? You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before she could finish her sentence, his hands suddenly loosened, and then he pushed her away completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She staggered back several steps and almost fell to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was still extremely pale, "I'm fine! There's nothing wrong! Since my gift has been delivered today, I should leave now! Please tell Miss. Reed and your parents for me. I'm leaving now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Roger turned and left quickly, leaving Jasper standing there in a daze, looking worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's wrong with him? Is he really okay?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, Roger's appearance just now made her feel like he had experienced something terrible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did the conversation just now remind him of his parents' death, or did he experience something even more terrible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Jasper felt his mind was in chaos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, when Roger rushed out of the Reed family mansion, he almost stumbled and had to lean against the walls along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that moment, he thought of the experiences he had after being kidnapped by the kidnappers from the hospital, those dark experiences he didn't want to recall!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she even asked him to speak it out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he describe such experiences?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could someone as pure and clean as her think of such darkness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cleaner she was, the more he felt his own filth, and the more he had the urge to destroy her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to destroy her cleanliness and make her as muddy as he was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why... did he still want to hold her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even he himself didn't understand this impulse!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jasper returned to the main room, it was almost time to cut the cake. William walked up to her and asked, "What's wrong? I sent you a message, but you didn't reply. Mason has returned to the living room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I didn't notice the message," Jasper stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you look so bad? Did something happen?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing, nothing happened," she forced a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, it was time to cut the cake. The Reed family stood beside today's birthday girl, Jasmine. With a knife in her hand, Jasmine made a wish, blew out the candles, and began cutting the cake under everyone's gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Laughter and congratulations filled the scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William, however, looked at Jasper's strained smile and showed a thoughtful expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not long after Jasper left, Roger also disappeared. And when Jasper returned, Roger was nowhere to be seen in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, did something happen when Jasper went out to look for Mason?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And could this be related to Roger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While everyone was eating cake, William walked up to Jasper and asked, "Roger isn't in the living room. Do you know where he went?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, he said he had to go back first," Jasper answered nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Go back first?" William pondered. "Did he tell you that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, when I went to find Mason earlier, I happened to run into him, and he said he had to go back first," Jasper said. Although what she said was true, she inexplicably felt guilty.</span></p></div>
