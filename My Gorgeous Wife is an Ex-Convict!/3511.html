        <h1>Chapter 3509</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, did you really conspire with Lionel to kidnap me?" Veronica asked with a bitter voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The phrase "conspiracy" seemed to stimulate his nerves, causing him to show a hint of disbelief in his eyes. "Is this what you think?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not what I think, it's what you made me think!" Veronica said. "If not, then how did you manage to find that warehouse before the police did, based on some clue?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hadn't thought about these things before, but now she realized that these were obvious loopholes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he didn't know beforehand, how could he have been so lucky to find that place?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason felt as if his blood was slowly freezing. "So, Veronica, you don't believe what I said, do you? You don't believe that I really know nothing about the kidnapping case, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica pursed her lips tightly and stared at her, wanting an explanation, a reasonable one!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't want this kidnapping case to really have anything to do with him, but now... "How can I trust you? Why did you deceive me like a fool? Why did you create this kidnapping case? Even if you originally planned a fake kidnapping, it turned into a real one! If you really wanted to reconcile with me, why did you do such a terrifying thing? Do you know that I almost...I almost..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice choked up, and all the fear she had endured during the kidnapping, as well as the fear and terror she had experienced in her nightmares several times since then, all poured out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she felt so ridiculous. She had been so moved by him rushing to her side and saving her when she was in danger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she never thought that he was the mastermind behind everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, you really don't trust me?" he murmured, "Veronica, do you really consider me as your closest person?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she really did, then how could she not trust him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His black eyes seemed to be covered with a layer of sadness, and her heart felt a slight pain. But then, she deliberately ignored this feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about you? If you really consider me as your closest person, then you wouldn't have been involved in this kidnapping case with Lionel," Veronica said, "Do you think that as the high and mighty Mason of the Reed family, you can easily manipulate other people's emotions? Making me feel terrible afterwards? Mason, how could you do this? I am not your pawn!" she exclaimed loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyelashes trembled slightly, the chess piece... he had never regarded her as a chess piece!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"To me, you have always been the closest person to me, I..." He raised his hand, wanting to touch her face, but she suddenly turned her head away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't touch me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The moment these three words were uttered from her mouth, he suddenly stiffened all over, and the hand that was reaching out to her finally stopped beside her cheek, not moving forward anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And that handsome face seemed to be covered with a veil, making it even more difficult to see clearly.</p></div>
