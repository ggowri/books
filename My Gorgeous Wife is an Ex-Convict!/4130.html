        <h1>Chapter 4128</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina entered the elevator first and looked at Kit who was still outside the elevator, "Aren't you coming in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit pursed their lips, hesitated for a moment, and then entered the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The elevator doors closed, and Tina asked Kit, "Did you recognize me when you were on stage?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hmm," they responded indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How did you recognize me?" After all, Tina has also changed her appearance!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is it really difficult to recognize?" he asked back directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"..." Well, maybe this disguise wasn't very successful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Your performance tonight was amazing! Congratulations on going solo in advance. You will definitely become even better!" Tina said sincerely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit looked at the person in front of him. Indeed, he felt comfortable by her side. The tension that had been present throughout the concert seemed to slowly relax at this moment...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, the elevator suddenly stopped abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But it hadn't reached the fifth floor yet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina felt a sense of unease. Just as the elevator shook, Tina instinctively grabbed onto the handrail next to her and looked at Kit, "Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But when she looked at him, Tina's heart skipped a beat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was definitely not okay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit, at this moment, had turned pale. Not the kind of paleness from makeup, but a real paleness. His lips even seemed to have lost their color.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's wrong with you?" Tina asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit didn't answer her. He just continued to breathe heavily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, the elevator stopped shaking. Tina quickly walked to Kit's side and asked, "Do you have a medical condition? Or are you scared? Although the elevator malfunctioned, someone should be coming to fix it soon!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, Eugenia and the staff took the previous elevator and should still be waiting for her on the 5th floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now that the elevator had a problem, Eugenia and the staff would soon find out, and someone would naturally come to repair it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Of course, at the same time, Tina quickly pressed all the floors and the emergency button in the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But just as she finished these steps, the lights in the elevator suddenly went out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This... Is there no power?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was no sound coming from the other end of the emergency communication button either!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, perhaps because she knew her friend was waiting upstairs, Tina's inner self remained calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What she was more concerned about was Kit's increasingly rapid breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Could it be an asthma attack?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina thought to herself, but she asked Kit, "Do you have any medicine on you? Do you need to take medication?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But apart from his rapid breathing, he still didn't answer her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina gritted her teeth and said, "I'm really sorry!" Then she reached out and started feeling around Kit's body.</p></div>
