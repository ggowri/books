        <h1>Chapter 1757</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was livid when he saw the email. However, they stopped replying after he sent another email.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "I'll go. Lily and Sean seem determined to get me there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed thin lips together tightly and said nothing. He clearly disagreed with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, I'll take good care of myself, but... Even if you're against this, I have to save Mason. It's the only thing I can do for him as his mother!" Grace said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason sighed helplessly. He could never go against her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Well, let's make a bet. If something happens to you, I'll follow suit!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The simple sentence represented his determination. Grace's heart trembled as she understood what Jason meant. His life and death would depend on her&rsquo;s!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace forced herself to sleep that night. Only with adequate sleep could she have more strength and energy to save Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason slowly opened his eyes after Grace fell asleep. His lips gently fell on her deformed fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, who matters most to you right now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His question was left unanswered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The place where the transaction was going to take place was on a hill. It had a dense forest and was sparsely populated. The surroundings were vast undeveloped areas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anything could happen in a place like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was holding a phone the kidnappers had prepared. They had put it somewhere with no surveillance cameras and emailed her to pick it up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The phone could only receive incoming calls. It could not make calls or send messages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Standing in front of her was a man wearing one of those Monkey King masks one could find at any roadside stall. He handed her a laptop and asked her to transfer the money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I want to see Mason first. I won't transfer the money if I don't see him," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then let her!" the female voice on the phone said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The man turned around silently and brought out an unconscious child moments later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mason!" shouted Grace. Mason's face was somewhat bruised and swollen. He had obviously been beaten up. "What did you do to Mason? Why is he unconscious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I just gave him two pills so he would sleep. Don't worry, he's not going to die." The woman sounded a little angry when she spoke on the other line of the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The brat did not behave like a normal kid at all. He even hurt her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sure enough, a child whom the abnormal Secretary Wang taught was abnormal too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Transfer the money right now. As soon as we receive it, you can take him and leave. We're all just taking what we need," the female voice said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What the hell did you feed him?" Grace snapped.</p></div>
