        <h1>Chapter 1872</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina's my best friend. I'll help her no matter what trouble she's in," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the blood test report came out and the team of specialists Jason arranged arrived as well. They urgently examined Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina woke up, she learned that something was wrong with the progesterone shot she took at the community health center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was something else in her blood that caused her heart to beat faster, thus affecting the baby's heartbeat as well. This unknown substance would often kill the unborn child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How... How could something be wrong with the progesterone shot?&rdquo; Lina's face was full of disbelief. Then, her hands nervously covered her belly. "Baby... My baby..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The baby's fine, but you&rsquo;ll need to stay for further observation. After all, it was injected through an IV, so the effects are more direct," said Grace, trying to alleviate the problem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How did this happen? How could there be something wrong with the progesterone shot?" Lina burst into tears. What she was worried about was not her health but the baby and whether the baby would be okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was at this moment she realized how important the baby in her belly was to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace assured her friend, saying, "I'll find out what on earth is going on here. All you have to do now is have a good rest and not cry. Crying too much will affect your health. Your baby can only survive this if you're well-rested."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina quickly wiped her tears. "Okay, I won't cry. I... I'll rest well. I won't let this baby leave me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace waited until her best friend fell asleep before leaving the hospital. Jason's car was already waiting at the hospital entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason got out of the car and walked up to Grace. "Are you going home now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah." Fatigue flashed through Grace's gaze. "Why are you here? Didn't I tell you I could go home by myself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said, "I wanted to pick you up. Are you tired?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"A little," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two of them got in the car, and Jason asked, "How's Lina doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She's alright. She just needs some rest and to get the drug out of her system. But we don't know its effects on the baby yet. That needs further observation," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Katherine Jackson did it," Jason said out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What?" Grace's eyes widened in surprise. "Katherine Jackson? You found out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, it wasn&rsquo;t that hard. But Katherine Jackson has gone into hiding and we can't find her," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A harsh countenance flashed across Grace's eyes. 'How dare Katherine Jackson lay a hand on Lina? I'll make sure she pays for this!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Can you find her?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"As long as she hasn't left Emerald City, we'll be able to find her. But it'll take some time," Jason said as he looked at the rare angry expression on Grace's face. "Does Lina's incident make you this angry?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Of course. How dare Katherine Jackson use such despicable means on Lina? She obviously wants to kill the baby in Lina's belly with the shot! Doesn't she know how important a child is to a mother?" snapped Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason looked down slightly and smirked. "But for some mothers, children are nothing more than a tool they can discard at any time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze, instantly realizing what she just said had reminded him of his mother again.</p></div>
