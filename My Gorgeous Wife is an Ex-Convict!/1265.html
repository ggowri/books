        <h1>Chapter 1264</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What a scheming b*tch! I didn't expect the crown prince to support someone like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She deliberately set up others. How disgusting! Without this video, wouldn't the man in the video have been utterly wronged?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard Stella is suing a man for rape. Could it be this man? Oh my God! Isn't this an example of a thief crying 'stop thief'? Stella is the one who should go to jail, no?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone chimed in. Stella only wished she could smash the screen right away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who? Who's trying to sabotage me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, there was a sudden commotion at the entrance of the banquet hall. Stella looked up and saw a tall figure walking this way. Who else could it be if not Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella had hoped for Brian to come earlier and prove to everyone that they were on good terms!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Stella now wished Brian had not come!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella hurriedly ran up to Brian and said in a panic, "Brian, don't look... Someone is trying to set me up with this video. It's not true. They... They used some technology to do this on purpose! Isn't there a lot of advanced technology now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked up, and his phoenix eyes looked at the screen at the front of the hall where the video was playing. The video was not long. It was just over three minutes, but it was long enough for people to understand what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'So... Chase Harper was really wronged and framed by the woman in front of me! Just because Chase Harper knows Grace!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian could understand the reason why Stella framed Chase Harper without anyone telling him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought of how Grace had told him that she would get justice for Chase Harper, yet he only thought she cared about Chase Harper. He had forgotten that she was a person who was willing to stand up to injustice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had it not been for this, she would not have insisted on carrying him down the hill under such difficult circumstances!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said coldly, "Set up? Did they set you up, or did you set others up? Stella, do you think everyone else is stupid?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was so cold, and a hush fell over the vast hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I didn't set anyone up. All this is just someone trying to sabotage me and make you misunderstand me. Brian, you need to believe me!" Stella made a conscious attempt to grab Brian's arm, but before her hand could reach him, she was stopped by two bodyguards who were following Brian. Her hands were grabbed by a bodyguard each.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she was a prisoner!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was shocked. "Brian, what... What are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian paid no attention to her. His dark phoenix eyes only looked up again to watch the video carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I made such a huge mistake just because I believed you too much," muttered Brian. Then his gaze fell on Stella. &ldquo;You should've never made me miss out on Grace. I was stupid, but you deserve to die!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's heart gave a jolt, and fear surged through her body. "I... I don't know what you're talking about, Brian. You seem to have a deep misunderstanding about me... Ask them to let go of me. There are things we can talk about slowly..."</p></div>
