        <h1>Chapter 2043</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Just try it a couple of times. If you still can't master it, I'll teach you some other time," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, thank you in advance, then." Chase Harper smiled and then added, "Those two men probably removed the tire of your tricycle just now. Some garages are heartless like that! They won't last long. You have so much stuff here. Let me take you home first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But my tricycle..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Give me the keys. I'll have my colleague fix it for you and help you ride it back to your place. I have a tire shop right here in the market," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you so much," said Kyla as she handed the electric tricycle's keys over to Chase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase talked to his colleague, helped Kyla carry her stuff to his car, and drove her back to the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On their way, Kyla learned that Chase had partnered up with a friend to open a shop but they had dissolved their partnership. He was now renting a store in the market by himself, selling electric bikes and various accessories. Sometimes, he would receive orders to modify cars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's good to do business alone. It&rsquo;s easy to have conflicting opinions when friends do business together, making it hard to go on," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's not that we had different opinions. It's just that..." Chase Harper seemed troubled as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla knew it might be something he was too embarrassed to talk about, so she did not pursue it and changed the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car arrived in front of the store. Chase Harper moved Kyla's goods from the car and greeted Mrs. Corbyn warmly. After finding out that the store's water pipes were always clogged, he took the tools from the car and helped fix their pipes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you so much! You sent me back, helped me with my tricycle, and even helped me fix my pipes," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper said, "It's nothing. Don't mention it. I gotta go now. I'll let you know when your tricycle is ready."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After Chase Harper left, Mrs. Corbyn seemed to say regretfully, "Speaking of which, Chase's pretty good, and he's nice to Nelson. If you had gotten together with Chase, you would be leading a good life now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "Mom, what are you thinking? Chase has never felt that way for me. He's a good man who deserves to be cherished. I'm at peace with myself. I&rsquo;ll only be giving him trouble if I get together with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh, I was just saying," said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Two days later, Chase Harper rode Kyla's tricycle back. He happened to meet Nelson Corbyn as he got off school. Chase Harper mentioned that his daughter would always mention Brother Nelson these days. Therefore, Mrs. Corbyn took the opportunity to propose that her daughter, Nelson, Chase Harper, and his daughter go to the amusement park together to play and relax.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll take care of the store. Business is slow on weekends anyway," said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Their customers were mainly students, so they were free during weekends as business was slow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If Kyla and Nelson are okay with it, I'll take Juliet to the amusement park this weekend. Speaking of which, I haven't taken her to the amusement park in a long time," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla smiled. "Okay, Nelson hasn't gone there in a long time either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sure enough, after she said yes, she saw a look of expectation on her son's face. It seemed he was happy.</p></div>
