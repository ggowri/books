        <h1>Chapter 2637</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you hungry? Why don't... I make a bowl for you too?" She turned to look at him and spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her with his thin lips pressed together but said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Forget... I said anything, then," she said awkwardly. Come to think of it, the chef at the mansion cooked much better food than her simple tomato and egg noodles. Besides, he did not say he was hungry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you asked, how can I forget? Kyla, do you like going back on your word?" With that said, he ignored her, left the kitchen, and sat down at the dining table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. 'Does he... want me to make a bowl for him too?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she began to prepare another bowl of noodles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Soon, two bowls of tomato and egg noodles were ready. Kyla brought them to the dining table, a bowl for each of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, go ahead. But the noodles just got out of the pot. Be careful not to burn yourself," she reminded and lowered her head to eat the noodles in the bowl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked blankly at Kyla as she ate her noodles with her head down in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was not hungry at all, but he recalled the time they were dating each other and she had asked him if he wanted to cook a bowl of noodles for him. She said she would learn to cook and cook for him often.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These were only memories, but his feelings for her were already gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when the memory recurred to him, he suddenly wanted to eat her cooking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Aren't you going to eat?" She looked up at him. "Noodles get mushy easily. They won't taste good once they get lumpy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What on earth do you want?" he asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused slightly. Moments later, she spoke earnestly, "I want to be a real married couple with you and have a sweet family with you and the kids."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you afraid it's gonna look bad for the kids to have divorced parents after we divorce?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It has nothing to do with the kids. It's me. I want to remain your wife and not divorce you!' she explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because you love me?" he asked back with a note of sarcasm in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His tone made her smile bitterly. "Yes, because I love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I don't want to love you. Loving you is too tiring and exhausting. I don't want to experience having my pride shattered again. I only hope that you'll keep your word and sign the divorce papers obediently when the three months are up," said Martin Weiss</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he got up to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She grabbed his hand almost subconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Have I not made myself clear?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've made yourself clear, and I heard you clearly." She bit her lip and took a deep breath, trying hard to hold back the tears that threatened to pour out of her eyes. "I just wanted to ask... Aren't you going to eat the noodles?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'm not. You can throw them out later. You can also leave them here if you're lazy to throw them out. The servants will clear the mess tomorrow," he answered before withdrawing his hand from her fingertips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked blankly at the untouched bowl of noodles on the table and smiled bitterly while tears rolled down her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not believe that she loved him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, he did not want to love her anymore! He considered that love humiliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin, I don't want to lose you..." she murmured. What did she have to do to convince him that she loved him and that her feelings were sincere, not just a lie she was telling for their kids?</p></div>
