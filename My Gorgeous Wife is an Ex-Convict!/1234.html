        <h1>Chapter 1233</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick's expression immediately sank. That was true. Even if he did not tell him now, Brian would find out about it sooner or later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, there was no hiding such things!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you'd better brace yourself. Also, I don't know if it's true," said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his eyebrows slightly. He somehow had a sense of foreboding. It was as if the news Patrick was going to tell him might be the last thing he wanted to know!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Patrick handed the phone to Brian, the pupils in his phoenix eyes immediately shrank upon seeing the photo on the phone. He instantly grabbed the phone and stared at the photo on the screen. His blood seemed to freeze, and even his breathing stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a man and a woman... in the photo. Both were dressed in white, looking just like a couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They appeared to be sitting on the chairs in a waiting area. The photo was a screenshot. The screenshot also had the caption: [Guess who's the man getting married at tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau today? You'll get a prize for guessing the right answer!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Patrick's fair-weather friend sent him the photo, he had asked: [Someone forwarded me this photo. Is this man Jason? Is he married? No way!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it Jason...' If you asked Brian, it was him! Grace was also in the photo with Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was the photo... taken in tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau? Was Grace and Jason... registering for their marriage license?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's mind went blank, and his eyes just stared at the photo on the phone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Patrick quickly pulled the phone away from Brian's hand. "Stop looking at it. We don't know whether it's true! You haven't recovered yet. Take care of yourself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at his empty hands with a pale face. He suddenly grabbed his phone on the coffee table and dialed Grace's number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ringing a few times, he finally got through. However, it was Jason's voice that sounded from the phone. "Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's heart immediately sank. 'Jason answered Grace's phone. What does this mean? Is Grace with Jason now? Is the photo... true? Are they really...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you... register for a marriage license with Grace today?" He spat out the second half of the sentence with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Grace and I are already married. Brian, I don't want anything more going on between you and my wife than that of normal men and women," Jason seemed to be speaking casually, but there was a faint note of warning in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's fingers held the phone tightly. "Why did Grace marry you so suddenly? Are you two together now? Put Grace on the phone. I want to hear it from her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's not available right now. Also, she's pregnant. They&rsquo;re mine," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The words came as a blow, leaving Brian stunned. 'Pregnant? Grace is... pregnant? She&rsquo;s pregnant with Jason's baby?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is going on? What happened in between? Why is there such a big change in just a few days?'</p></div>
