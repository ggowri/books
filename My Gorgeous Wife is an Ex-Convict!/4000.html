        <h1>Chapter 3998</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The consequences were already terrifying to think about!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, isn't that Irene, who failed to climb the ladder? How dare you show your face here!" a voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene looked up and saw her former colleague, who was always at odds with her. Now, of course, the person was kicking her while she was down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shut up!" Irene said fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can shut up, but I don't know if others will," the other person said with a smile. "Besides, you're the one who did that ugly thing. I heard you deliberately drugged the drink to have sex with Mr. Reed and climb the social ladder!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, the person's voice continued, "By the way, I heard you once climbed the social ladder before. You were adopted by the Reed family and were even the Reed family's daughter for a while. Unfortunately, the real daughter came back later, and you were kicked out!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene was suddenly shocked and widened her eyes. "How do you know?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you search online, although it's a bit difficult, you can find the news about you being adopted. You didn't even change your name!" the other person sneered. "Speaking of which, the Reed family really had foresight. They knew you were up to no good, so they kicked you out early like a piece of rat shit."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene stared at the other person and suddenly raised her hand, slapping the person in the face. "I told you to shut up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other person was slapped and immediately hit Irene back. "How dare you hit me! Look at what you are! You were so shameless at the hotel that day. Many people saw you naked, and some even took photos and videos! You can search online in the future. Maybe you'll find them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them started fighting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When others rushed over to separate them, the woman who fought with Irene continued to curse, "Who do you think you are? Daring to drug someone. The Reed family won't let you go. You can wait to go to jail!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The others looked at Irene with disdain and only cared about the woman she fought with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Irene, you've gone too far!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, she has no shame. Now she's even assaulting her colleague!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"People like her should go to jail as soon as possible!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene suppressed her anger as no one was on her side now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her life had become even worse than before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all of this was because of the Reed family, because of Nancy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would make all these people pay the price!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy didn't expect to receive a call from Irene on the day she was leaving Emerald City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, I want to see you." Irene said on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think there's any need for us to meet." Nancy replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Don't you want to know about Mick?" the other party said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time she heard the name Mick, it made her heart ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have no relationship with Mr. Reed anymore, so I certainly don't want to know about his affairs." Besides, her intuition was telling her that there was no benefit in meeting Irene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Then I'll put those recordings of you using Mick on the internet, and let everyone know that Clarissa's imprisonment was caused by your mischief, and that you used Mick! So, do you think Clarissa will be acquitted?" Irene continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy remained silent.</span></p></div>
