        <h1>Chapter 3549</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You play the piano very well, and I like your piano, so I want to be friends with you," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For some reason, in an instant, she felt like there was a hint of mockery in his eyes. "Too bad, I'm not interested in being friends with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just as ordinary friends!" she insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not interested," he replied in the same tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then what are you interested in?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to know?" he raised an eyebrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She nodded her head, not knowing why, but she had a feeling that the person in front of her was Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So she wanted to know more about him, to find out if he really was Lawrence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, follow me," he said, and walked ahead without waiting for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was surprised by his words, but she didn't hesitate and quickly followed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half an hour later, Jasper stood at the entrance of a chemistry laboratory. She didn't expect him to bring her here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why did you come here?" she asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I have any experiments to do, I come here," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But doesn't the school have a laboratory?" she asked. Stanford University's chemistry department is also strong, so it naturally has a decent laboratory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I'm only a freshman now, and even if I could use it, I could only do some basic experiments, unlike here," Roger said. "Do you want to go in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, okay. But can I go in?" she asked. After all, as far as she knew, this kind of chemical laboratory is generally not open to outsiders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I take you in, there won't be any problems. However, you'll need to put on a lab coat first. And once you're inside, don't touch anything. You might accidentally touch something that could cost you your life. So, do you still want to go in?" He said in a calm tone, but there was a hint of mockery in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper hesitated for a moment, looked at the face in front of her, and finally took a deep breath. "I want to go in. I'll strictly follow what you said."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Roger's eyes flickered slightly. He took Jasper directly to change into the lab coat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once they were inside, Jasper only saw Roger skillfully mixing and adjusting different chemicals on the operating table. She couldn't understand any of it, just like watching scientists doing scientific research in a TV drama.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even many of the proprietary terms on the reagent bottles were mostly incomprehensible to her. After all, she was good at humanities, but not so much at science. Especially chemistry, which always flew over her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when she saw the label on one of the transparent bottles, she stared at it for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What, interested in this?" Roger's voice sounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isn't thallium supposed to be colorless and tasteless? Why are these white particles?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because it's currently stored in paraffin," he said. "But I didn't expect you to know that it's colorless and tasteless."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because there was a famous poisoning case in the news, where this was added to water for people to drink over a long period of time. Ordinary people wouldn't notice it, but in the end it would cause poisoning and intellectual degradation, and it's irreversible!" Jasper said.</p></div>
