        <h1>Chapter 463</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer was stunned. She had just noticed her daughter's extremely pale face. "What nonsense are you talking about, Lily? Apologize? Apologize to Grace? How is that possible? She's lucky I didn't damage her face on the spot! How can you expect me to apologize to her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It'll be too late if you and Dad don't apologize now." Lily simply took out her phone and was about to dial her father's phone number when her mother snatched it away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You have to make it clear to me," said Camelia Meyer as she stared at her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily took a deep breath. "Grace now has Jason behind her, Mom. Our family can't afford to offend the Reed family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer's face immediately changed. Her eyes were full of shock. "How can this be? Are you kidding me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wish I was joking too, but it's true! Didn't you ask me why Zoe's leg hasn't completely healed after so long and how she hurt it?" said Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching her daughter's serious expression, Camelia Meyer suddenly felt a tingling on her scalp. She sensed that the answer to that was not what she wanted to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could only listen right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason had someone do it. Zoe hurt Grace, so Jason helped Grace get payback. No, that&rsquo;s not right. Jason made sure Zoe paid back a hundredfold for her wrongdoing!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer was stunned. When she heard Jason's name, she felt her legs go limp. She almost fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason... Was Grace now backed by Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was once her future son-in-law and her pride! If she had become Jason's mother-in-law, no one in Emerald City would not flatter her and curry favors with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had the time of her life when her eldest daughter became Jason's fianc&eacute;e, but it was gone all too soon!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can Jason have Grace's back? Doesn&rsquo;t he know that Grace is the one who killed Jennifer?" Camelia Meyer suddenly shouted agitatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily quickly stopped her mother. "Of course, he knows. But he has his eyes on Grace now. Even if you're displeased with it, we don't have a say in whoever Jason wants to like, Mom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could Camelia Meyer not understand this? She just could not suppress the hatred in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily had no time to soothe her mother right now. The most urgent thing was to solve the current situation immediately so that Jason would not turn against the Atkinson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily once again took the phone from her mother's hand and quickly dialed her father's phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Terrence hastily rushed into the president's office and said, "A video on Miss Cummins has surfaced on the internet, Young Master Reed... Would you like to see it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence said this with some hesitation. He was worried about how his boss would react after watching the video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, as his private secretary, he knew exactly where Grace stood in his boss' heart. What the Atkinson family did was no doubt the same as pinning Young Master Reed's precious darling, who he was trying so hard to protect, on the ground and beating her.</p></div>
