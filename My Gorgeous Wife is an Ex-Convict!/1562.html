        <h1>Chapter 1560</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That night, Grace felt like they were back to how they were back then&mdash;intimate. However, she was more of the one who took the initiative this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Back then, he would tempt her with all his might so she would indulge in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now, she was the one taking the initiative.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew what to do to make him happy. She knew how his body was going to react. Even though he had forgotten her, his body remained the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was exhausted in the end. Jason even carried her into the bathroom to clean up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could barely move her fingers as he washed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked at the bruises and red marks on her body. They were the traces he had left behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His body craved her more than he could have imagined. Even when she lay upon him, every cell in his body seemed to be clamoring and longing for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was like rain after a long drought. He longed for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was probably the only one who could make him take care of her like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as he put her in a bathrobe and carried her out of the bathroom to go back into the room, she leaned on his chest and muttered, "Jay, do you... know how much I love you? There's really nothing going on between Brian and me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His thin lips pressed slightly. "Is that all you have to say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason put Grace on the bed. "Grace, you used to be my wife. Since I loved you before, I can also love you now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She looked delighted. "Are you going to love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He said, "Yes. But you can't betray me, let alone leave me as easily as you did back then. Understand?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As she looked at him, she could not help raising her hand and touching his eyes, which were like the stars at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Though her arm ached as she raised it, she still wanted to touch him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Betray...' He had also said the same thing back then in front of his father&rsquo;s memorial tablet in Reed Residence&rsquo;s mourning hall, wanting her to never betray him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is he afraid what happened to his parents would happen to us?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, I must have left you because I had to." Her fingers ran gently over his eyes, which were the most beautiful part of his face that resembled his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We're not your parents. I won't betray you. I'll never do it, and... it'll never happen," she spoke solemnly, her face looking earnest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was her promise and oath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a slight sparkle in his eyes. 'Does she... know about my parents? That's true. It's not surprising she knows if I loved her before.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then prove it to me with the rest of your life." He gently pulled her hand down and held it in his palm, feeling the slightly deformed joints of her fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p></div>
