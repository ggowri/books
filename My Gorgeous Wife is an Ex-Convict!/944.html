        <h1>Chapter 943</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she left, Lily could not help turning around to look at Grace and Jason again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does Grace still have Jason as her backer? Is it true that they broke up?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Jason was defending Grace, it would be difficult to lay a hand on Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily was resentful that she was forced to quit the entertainment industry because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in front of Grace, she had to be nice and could not lash out. Lily's heart was full of hatred as she thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I had known&hellip; I should&rsquo;ve gone hard on Grace and let her die in jail back then!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brother, are we going to be alright?" Zoe looked like she had just survived a disaster. It was good enough for her that she would not have to apologize and pay any money. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Sean frowned. In his opinion, Jason was not a soft-hearted man. He was a harsh person to those who offended him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Zoe insulted Grace earlier, but Jason merely slapped and criticized her... It's almost like&hellip; he was holding it up high and letting it down gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he... letting us off the hook that easily?' Sean was not sure, but now, he could only tell his sister, "Maybe. You should be more careful in the future. Don't mess with Grace again, or you'll drag the whole Stevens family down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoe curled her lips in disdain. "That's because she has Jason. She's nothing without Jason! Hmph. Let's wait till Jason gets tired of her one day. We'll see what I'll do to her then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough! Haven't you had enough today? Do you want your other leg to be broken too?" Sean yelled angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoe's face reddened immediately and she stopped talking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily looked at Sean with a faint worry in her eyes. Today, she noticed that there was a trace of nostalgia in his eyes when he first saw Grace at the banquet today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Nostalgia... What is he nostalgic about? Is he thinking about his past with Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would never allow her man to keep a second woman in his heart. She had to be the only one!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace ate from her plate with her head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The banquet seemed to have put a lot of effort into the food. All the dishes were made with premium ingredients, and the chef did a great job at preparing the meals so they all tasted good. Of course, she needed to ignore the gazes on her for her to properly enjoy the food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was Jason's date at the banquet, which was already impressive enough. Coupled with Zoe&rsquo;s antics earlier, the other guests would throw her a look every now and then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, none of their gazes was as strong as the gaze of the man sitting next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After taking a few mouthfuls, Grace looked up and said, "The food here tastes good. Why don't you go and get something to eat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll have a taste," he said, leaning over and biting off the steak she was holding with a fork.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. Then, she realized that she had already taken a bite of the steak on her fork earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It does taste good," he said with a smile on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately turned her head away uncomfortably. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught a glimpse of the entrance of the banquet hall not far away and was stunned!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A couple was now entering the banquet hall, their arrival attracting quite a few glances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Both of them happened to be people Grace knew&mdash;Brian and Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was in a daze as she watched them walk slowly into the banquet hall. When she took the firm's documents to get Curtis Row's signature, she had seen Brian and Stella appearing in the same way.</p></div>
