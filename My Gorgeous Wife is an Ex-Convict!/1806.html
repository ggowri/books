        <h1>Chapter 1804</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It&rsquo;ll take about a year and a half to heal, but he said I should be able to carry light things in a week. After a month, I should be able to do simple things like typing and writing," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's good." Lina breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said goodbye to Kyla before heading to the He family&rsquo;s house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina sat in the store and said to Kyla, "Grace was eager to meet her son as soon as she got discharged, but Mason..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "He's still young and unfamiliar with Grace. Maybe they'll get closer after some time. I saw how that boy is attached to his sister. That means he'll accept anyone who is truly kind to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I hope so," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two chatted, and Nelson soon returned. Nelson Corbyn greeted Lina politely when he saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why are your clothes so dirty? Did you fall?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I accidentally fell," said Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Your pants are torn." Lina saw a hole in the knee of Nelson's pants, which she thought was caused by the fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Go change your pants. I'll mend them," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn responded and went to the room at the back to change his pants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked at Nelson Corbyn's tiny figure and frowned slightly. Then, she looked again at Kyla, who was busy with her store. Lina walked to the room at the back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn was about to take off his pants. His face instantly turned red when he saw Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before he could speak, Lina took a step forward and asked, "Did you get into a fight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn's expression stiffened when she asked that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't lie. Your Aunt Lina used to fight almost every day when I was little and made my parents worry a lot. You've always been a cautious child. If you had really fallen, you wouldn't have ended up like this. Here, here, and here&hellip; These are all signs of friction.&rdquo; Lina pointed to a few spots on Nelson Corbyn's clothes. She also grabbed Nelson's pants legs and pulled them up, revealing several bruises on his calves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina asked, "What's going on?" Nelson was not a troublemaker. On the contrary, he was a quiet child who would not cause trouble. "Is someone bullying you at school?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson trembled slightly. Lina was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why are they bullying you?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson hesitated a little before saying, "Because I wear hearing aids. They say people like me should go to school for disabled people. They also said Mommy must have done something bad to give birth to a disabled child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's nose instantly felt sore when she heard this. She straightened up. "Who said this? I'll talk to their parents!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Aunt Lina!" Nelson yanked Lina. "Don't... Don't go look for their parents. I don't want Mommy to know about this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew his hearing disability was his mother's sore spot. Every time she saw his hearing aid, his mother's eyes would flash with guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His mother kept saying he could not hear because she had taken fever medicine when she was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he did not blame his mother at all. He thought his mother was the best! He did not want to see her sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would not have fought today if those guys had not talked about his mother.</p></div>
