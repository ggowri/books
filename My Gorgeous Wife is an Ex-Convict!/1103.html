        <h1>Chapter 1102</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would never let her down!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell was sent back to the Russell family's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian came to the Russell family's house almost as soon as he got the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uncle Russell, where did they take you today?" Brian had unconcealed anxiety on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell could not help sighing as he looked at Brian. Speaking of which, it was the first time he had seen him so anxious in all the years he knew the boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This anxiety was probably because of&hellip; "Is this because of that girl, Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's pupils shrank immediately. "Did you really treat Grace's hand today?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell said, "That's right! It's the first time an old man like me was blindfolded like that! A man was accompanying that girl all the time. His last name is Yi. Is that man Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pursed his thin lips. "Yes, it's Jason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then it looks like you've met your match," said Dr. Russell. 'Falling for that girl Grace, the boy will suffer no matter who she falls for.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian asked, "Do you know where you were taken to?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was blindfolded all the way. The car probably drove for about 20 minutes, but I was taken to a pretty old mansion. The interior is decorated in traditional Chinese style, and the buildings don't look new. Besides, the entire mansion must be quite large. I only saw one part of it," said Dr. Russell as he recalled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned. An old mansion that was about a 20-minute drive away from Dr. Russell's clinic where he was taken away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were so many places they could have gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, they might have taken a detour! Maybe they took Dr. Russell on a detour on purpose because they were afraid of being found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace... How was she when you saw her?" asked Brian after a while, but he asked somewhat timidly as if he were afraid of hearing something he did not want to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was alright. Nothing special. But... Jason cares a lot about her," said Dr. Russell. It was rare for him to be nosy. "Are you really going to steal someone from Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If it&rsquo;s Grace, then&hellip; I will," Brian answered affirmatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian left in a hurry after getting enough clues from Dr. Russell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe these clues were crucial for him to find... Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace was asleep in the middle of the night, she had a recurring nightmare of being beaten up in prison. Her body seemed to be receiving kicks. Bursts of pain exploded in her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even her constant pleading for mercy was of no use!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not even know how long she had to endure the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Will I die in prison? Who will mourn for me when I die?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's come over you? Grace? Grace!" A voice seemed to call to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who is it? It's such a familiar voice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who is it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Somebody help me!'</p></div>
