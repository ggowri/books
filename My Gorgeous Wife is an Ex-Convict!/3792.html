        <h1>Chapter 3790</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Believe her? Should he believe her again? Mason looked at Veronica with a heavy gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he believed her again, would he fall into this pain and unease again if something similar happened next time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to choose to hypnotize his feelings, wasn't it because he didn't want to endure this pain anymore?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then why go through it again and again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm tired, so I don't want to believe anymore." After saying this, Mason raised his hand and pulled his sleeve away from Veronica's fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mason's figure disappeared completely from Veronica's sight, she lowered her head and stared blankly at the emptiness between her fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's like trying to grab onto something desperately, but in the end, nothing can be held onto.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His one sentence of being tired decided the breakup, but what about her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She once thought that she could have another chance at happiness, that she could walk with him in warmth, but now, everything has been turned upside down in just a few hours!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hurts! It really hurts!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is hurting?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it heartache? Or is it a headache? Or is every breath painful?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the most painful thing... is that even if she wants to cry now, she can't. She can only let out a hoarse scream from deep in her throat, which is a painful sound that she can't suppress no matter how hard she tries!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Mason returned to the Reed House, Jasper immediately greeted him, "Mason, you're back. Sister Veronica came to our house looking for you earlier. Your phone was off, and she was quite worried. Why don't you give her a call?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I've already seen her," Mason said in a cold voice, with a hint of fatigue on his usually handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at Mason's expression and felt that something was off. "Did something happen? Sister Veronica seemed very anxious when she came to find you earlier."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing major, we just broke up," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was shocked. "What did you say? You and Sister Veronica broke up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But... why? Weren't you two getting along well?" Jasper found it hard to believe. Just a few days ago, Mason and Sister Veronica were strolling around the campus festival together and even had a meal together!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she couldn't see anything unusual between Mason and Sister Veronica. In fact, they seemed to have a good relationship, and it was as if they had never been separated for those few years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I'm tired," Mason gave the answer and walked towards the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper stood there in disbelief. Mason and Sister Veronica broke up just because he was tired? Was he joking?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Jasper couldn't sleep and kept thinking about Mason's situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next morning, she naturally had dark circles under her eyes when she went to school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Did you not sleep well last night?" William looked at Jasper and said, "You don't look too good. Why don't you go back to the dorm and catch up on some sleep?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't sleep even if I go back to my room," Jasper said weakly.</span></p></div>
