        <h1>Chapter 1452</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He seemed to be telling Old Master Reed of his determination to love Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed glared at his only grandson. After a while, he slowly closed his eyes as if he was tired. With his dry and hoarse throat, he murmured, &ldquo;Men of the Reed family... never... end well when they love a woman too much. You... might not end well... if you... continue being like this..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed's voice grew weaker and weaker until his mouth stopped making any sound. The heartbeat line on the monitor nearby became a straight line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace felt a pang in her heart. She knew Old Master Reed was gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A life ended right in front of her eyes, and it terrified her. An elderly who was Jay&rsquo;s family no longer existed in this world. It all seemed a little unreal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason held Grace's hand tightly. He held it tighter and tighter until a cry of surprise sounded in his ears. He suddenly came to his senses and quickly let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Does it hurt?" He took her hand nervously and saw that it was faintly red as a result of him holding it too tight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She said, "I'm alright. Your grandfather..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, he's gone," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although his expression was still indifferent and did not seem to resemble the grieving faces of ordinary people who had just lost a loved one, she knew that he was sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed was his family, after all. He was even the only one who had accompanied him for so many years after his father's death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason turned around and half-closed his eyes. He looked at Old Master Reed who was lying on the hospital bed quietly as if he was tired and sleeping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace quietly accompanied Jason. This time, she held his hand firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed's funeral was set for three days later, and the body was first placed in an ice coffin. It was set up in the Reed family's mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, unlike normal practices, Jason did not receive outsiders to come to the hall to mourn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">For him, the mourning hall was a place where no outsiders were allowed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This mourning hall was his father&rsquo;s resting place, and now, his grandfather's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the past two days, Jason had pushed all his work away and spent almost 24 hours in the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace also went to the mourning hall several times, and each time, she only saw Jason standing by the ice coffin. He was dressed in white.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had also advised him several times to get some rest, and he always answered her gently, "I know. I'll take care of my health. Don't worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, how could she be at ease? She no longer felt as safe as before when she was lying in bed alone at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if unconsciously, she had grown used to having him sleep next to her and seeing him as soon as she opened her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is Jay still at the mourning hall?" Grace asked the butler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, Young Master is still at the mourning hall with Old Master Reed," the butler replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace then asked the butler to prepare some desserts. She took them and went over to the mourning hall.</p></div>
