        <h1>Chapter 2506</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn often flipped through the photos of his sister on his grandmother's phone and spoke like a little adult, wanting to take good care of his sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Lina found out that Kyla had given birth, she hurried to the hospital to visit Kyla. She said with a chuckle, "Thank God you gave birth smoothly. I'm going to be a godmother again. We have more children in our 'kindergarten' now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla could not help laughing at Lina's words, but her only regret was that Martin Weiss was not here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She learned from Grace that Martin Weiss had left Emerald City and returned to L City. Maybe that was the end of their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell made a video call to congratulate Kyla after learning she had given birth safely and passed the crisis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Congratulations on giving birth to a daughter," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you. I'll let you meet my two children when you come to Emerald City or when I go to Deer City," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay. I envy you. You have a son and a daughter now. If only I..." Amber Mitchell stopped short.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The baby who died after she gave birth to them had always been a sharp thorn in her heart. In all these years, she dared not think too much about the baby and neither was she willing to. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell, you can find happiness again after the matter with the Mitchell family is over. I think you'll have a child of your own someday!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell smiled nonchalantly. "I&rsquo;ve never thought about it. As for finding happiness... I found it, but I didn't realize it until Herman died. I didn't know he loved me that much. I would&rsquo;ve been so happy if I had chosen him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the wrong choice ruined her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe she would never be happy again. However, she would seek justice and the truth for herself and Herman no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Kyla did not want to remind Amber Mitchell of her sad past, so she asked, "How is it going with the Mitchell family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said, "The trial will be held in half a month, and all the preparations are currently in place. Grace's lawyer friends in Deer City are also helping me with this. There's enough evidence to convict the three of them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're finally getting what you want," said Kyla. Thinking of how her best friend had suffered in the mental hospital, her heart could not help but ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would take a lot of willpower not to get tortured into becoming a lunatic in that environment!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, finally&hellip;" Amber Mitchell said emotionally. She would go all out for her goal!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the phone call, Amber Mitchell picked up the documents nearby and looked through them. They were the Moss family's investigation reports of the accident, including detailed data of the car at the time, its condition, the road they drove on that day, the restaurant where she and Herman Moss were, and the people in the restaurant...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These reports probably contained more information than the reports the police had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's beautiful eyes narrowed as she caught sight of one of the photos tucked away in the file. She seemed to recall something...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell finally met George Gregory at the detention center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been waiting for almost a month, and he finally came to see her.</p></div>
