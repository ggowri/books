        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The red light turned green.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean was about to start the car again, but his body suddenly stiffened. "His figure..." The figure of the man who was called the most important person in the City appeared in his mind.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This man's figure looked very much like Jason Reed!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, that was impossible. How could Jason possibly be by Grace's side? What a joke!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The driver in the car behind Sean's honked his horn at him, and Sean started his car quickly. But at this moment, the man standing beside Grace looked up in the direction of his vehicle.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the man turned his head and looked over, Sean felt all the blood in his body freeze.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jason?!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was it really Jason? Even if his current outfit and hairstyle were different from Sean&rsquo;s impression of him, that face looked really like Jason Reed&rsquo;s!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean's body stiffened as he drove through the light, he debated pulling over or turning around. Every cell in his body wanted him to whip a U-turn and go back for a second look. He rubbed his eyes, thinking that everything had become surreal.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, at the intersection, Grace was rubbing her eyes. Finally, it seemed that whatever was tickling her vision&mdash;an eyelash or bit of dust maybe was gone. Jason's blowing had been quite effective.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She glanced at him and blinked a few times. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, thank you&mdash;&rdquo; but Jason&rsquo;s attention was elsewhere. He was staring angrily at the other side of the intersection.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jay, what are you looking at?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's nothing. It's just that... I seemed to have seen a familiar face just now," Jason said faintly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Was he your friend?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, he and I aren't friends," he said, and that angry look flashed across his eyes. Again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&mdash;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean didn't sleep well all night as the scene he saw at the intersection the day before kept replaying in his mind.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Surely, he had been mistaken, or perhaps the person standing beside Grace was someone who looked similar to Jason. Of course, that was it. Wasn&rsquo;t it said that everyone had a doppelganger out there somewhere?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, how could a man like Jason, who was so high and mighty, be with Grace?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Furthermore, Grace was the person who had killed Jason's fiancee. So in what world would Jason Reed ever find himself with the woman who murdered his true love?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">No one would have believed him even if he were to say this out loud.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, there was still uneasiness in his heart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">What if it was true? What if that man really was Jason... He didn't even dare to continue imagining.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next day, Sean came to the street, which Grace was cleaning.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He parked his car. Got out and approached her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had to know for sure.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you... with any man right now?" Sean asked politely. Well, his tone was polite, but his question was quite pointed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was stunned. She hadn't expected Sean to appear in front of her early in the morning and ask her such a question.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That doesn't seem to have anything to do with you, Mr. Stevens," she said. "I'm working right now, please get out of the way."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She continued to clean the road as if he was invisible.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean's expression turned cold. Who did she think she was, to ignore him!?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He grabbed Grace's hand and said, "I'm not joking with you. Who was the man with you yesterday?"</p></div>
