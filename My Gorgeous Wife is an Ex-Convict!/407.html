        <h1>Chapter 406</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crown prince's former girlfriends were from all walks of life. Of course, these girlfriends ended up with both good and bad outcomes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there were still many women who wanted to be Brian's girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people even said on the internet that even if Brian lost his crown prince status and was poor, they would follow him wholeheartedly. He was just so good-looking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the people around witnessed Brian going down on one knee to tie a woman's shoelace, there was nothing but the sound of gasping. Everyone was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only when Brian was done tying her shoelace that he reluctantly stood up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank&hellip; you," said Grace, slightly embarrassed. She kept her head down and hurriedly left. In the cafe where they were filming, Evelyn had been watching through the window. Her delicately manicured nails were sinking hard into her palms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why did... Grace appear in front of Brian again? Brian even took the initiative to go down on one knee in front of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It looked... just like submission!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A fit of deep jealousy welled up in her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must not let Brian know that Grace could be the girl he was looking for! She could not lose Brian, no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Outside, after Grace had left, Brian pursed his thin lips and glanced at the director and production assistant. "I don't want this to happen again. You don't have to keep these people on set anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as he said this, the men who tried to blackmail Grace earlier immediately looked like they were going to jump up and argue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they got a little intimidated when they saw Brian's cold eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since she didn't want to make a fuss about it, you can thank her for that. If you ever bother her again, then I can guarantee you'll be in jail for the rest of your lives!" A flash of ruthlessness passed over his eyes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They never expected to hit a snag after choosing a small restaurant to blackmail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, the fans outside were busy discussing. The topic of discussion was no more than who was the woman who was with the crown prince earlier. Was she his new girlfriend? Some were even counting down the days until the crown prince broke up with his current girlfriend. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace got back to the small restaurant, Kyla Corbyn hurried forward. "What took you so long? Did those people do anything to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. "I'm all right, nothing happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good." Kyla Corbyn breathed a sigh of relief. Then, as if she had made up her mind, she said, "If they want to make a scene, I'll just pay them so that no one in our restaurant gets hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was planning to spend money to avert a disaster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's all taken care of. I think those people won&rsquo;t dare to come here and make a fuss. If they&rsquo;re smart, they won&rsquo;t try their luck again for a little money," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You called the police?" Kyla Corbyn speculated.</p></div>
