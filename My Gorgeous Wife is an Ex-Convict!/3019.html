        <h1>Chapter 3017</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After speaking for a while, Jasper finally noticed the change in William's expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong with you?" she asked, blinking her eyes in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jasper, do you... do you not like me anymore?" William asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I really like you, William," said Jasper earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So..." he hesitated for a moment, then gathered his courage and asked, "Between me and your sister, who do you like more?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I like them all." Jasper replied naturally, pausing for a moment before adding as if she had just thought of something, "But Mommy says that since my little sister is still young, we should all take extra care of her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although William wasn't completely satisfied with the answer, he found it acceptable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she still likes him, it's good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Afterwards, don't just sleep with your sister, okay? Sleep with me too," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nearby servant almost ruined the moment upon hearing this statement. If the speaker wasn't just a 6 or 7-year-old child, their words could have easily sparked various inappropriate thoughts in others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper blinked and thought for a moment before saying, "So, when I visit Deer Capital, I'll sleep with you, and when I'm in Emerald City, I'll sleep with my little sister. Is that okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William nodded, "So you promise?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I promise!" She said, raising her hand and making a vow. Then she smiled at William and said, "Let me tell you, Mommy said this little sister looks just like me when I was a kid. I was so cute back then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke with a happy expression, showing a bit of pride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, William began to carefully look at the sleeping baby in the crib. After a moment, he said, "I still think you're cute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you've never seen me when I was a kid," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I just think you're cute, whether it's when you were a kid, now, or in the future," he said seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Jasper asked with wide eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, really," he nodded firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper smiled, feeling that William was perfect in every way. She always felt happy when she was with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I also think William is cute, cute in the past, cute now, and will be cute in the future," she said, suddenly hugging the person in front of her and kissing him on the cheek to show her affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William's face suddenly turned red, followed by his ears and neck turning red as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On her cheeks, the sensation of where she had been kissed was so apparent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he remains cute, will she continue to like him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she can like him, he will be willing to do anything for her, no matter what it is!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the party ended, Valda was feeling a bit exhausted, even though she didn't do much during the party. The most she did was greet people, but even so, she felt like her smile was starting to feel stiff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tired?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mhm," murmured Valda, "feels like we just fought a battle. Are you tired?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm used to it," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda probably has attended many such banquets since he was young.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will I have to attend these kinds of banquets often in the future?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you don't want to attend, then don't. There's no need to accommodate," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda breathed a sigh of relief at his words, but she also knew that this was his consideration for her. If they were really together in the future, how could they avoid attending banquets from families like the Hart family?</p></div>
