        <h1>Chapter 3946</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to watch me, you can do it openly, no need to sneak around like this." Mick's voice suddenly rang out in the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned, and her face turned red. Was she caught peeking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just what?" He looked at her calmly, his expression making her feel like he was teasing a pet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Um, but describing it like that seems like she's describing herself as a pet. Nancy muttered to herself in her heart, facing Mick's gaze, she boldly said, "Okay, if you say so!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, she really looked straight at him, looking openly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick smiled, "Do you like watching that much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, because you're good-looking." Nancy said, on the one hand, this was the truth, on the other hand, since her current persona in front of Mick was "liking Mick," she should try to show her liking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When someone likes another person, they should act like this, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so? Then watch more." Mick said, lowering his head to continue reviewing the documents in his hand, but the slight curve of his lips showed that he was in a good mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The word "good-looking," from childhood to adulthood, had been said to him by countless people in his presence. Hearing it so much had made him numb to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kind of praise was like a word he had heard too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when Nancy said it, he felt it was quite good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This woman always gives him a sense of novelty and contradiction. At first, he thought she was a very "cold" person, but later he found out that she blushes easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, just when he thought she was a shy person, sometimes she would behave very boldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kind of contradiction always surrounds her, which makes him even more curious and eager to explore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked at Mick working with his head down, and couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. After all, when she met Mick's gaze, her heart would beat abnormally fast, and she always felt that his eyes could see through all her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But looking at this man in such a straightforward way, she could observe him more carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His facial contours were very distinct, with a high nose bridge, making his face look three-dimensional, which is rare among Easterners.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of his drooping eyelids, his eyelashes appeared prominent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His sexy thin lips were tinged with a faint rose color... In her mind, a scene of kissing him suddenly flashed by... Ah, it felt so soft.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, she felt her face getting slightly hot again, and quickly shifted her gaze to his hand holding the pen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His slender and fair fingers holding the pen gave a very aesthetic feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Such hands are definitely a blessing for hand fetishists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These hands would be attractive when playing the piano or holding a cigarette between the fingers, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the internal phone rang, and the secretary's voice came from inside, "Mr. Reed, Manager Lanley from the R&amp;D department wants to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let him in," Mick said.</p></div>
