        <h1>Chapter 1227</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she liked to caress his eyebrows and eyes with her fingers while saying, "Do you know you're charming and seductive when you smile? It&lsquo;s as if you'll steal people's souls away when you smile like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would give an even more charming smile. "Have I stolen your soul then?" As he said, his peach blossom eyes would be focused on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately blushed and felt that she had dug a hole for herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took her hand and gently kissed it. "You know what? I only smile this way to show you the part of me that will attract you the most. I just want to attract you so you can love me more. Grace, I'll only smile like this for you. There will be no one else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had felt so warm and sweet back then, but now... After all the things that had happened between them, there seemed to be a deep gulf between them. She did not know what the future would hold for them...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you think it's a bad picture?" Jason's voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah. No, it's good," Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then let them use this photo for the marriage license," he said as he pulled the photo out of her hand and handed it to the staff nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's gaze turned to the vowing hall next door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Couples said their vows and received their marriage licenses from the staff here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had once yearned to give someone the promise of a lifetime too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We can skip the vowing part and just get the license if you don't want to do it," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips together and said abruptly, "I want to do it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A look of surprise flashed across his face. His dark eyes looked at her, and he did not speak for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed to finally come to her senses and immediately said, "If you don't want to&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to tell me, 'For richer, for poorer, in sickness and health, to join with you and share all that is to come, and I promise to love you and care for you forever'?" He slowly recited the wedding vows. He always had a good memory and remembered it easily after hearing the newly-married couples say it a few times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when the cold voice recited the vows, it sounded very calm&mdash;different from the excitement of the couples earlier who did it. "Tell me, can we love and care for each other forever?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shivered a little and met Jason's eyes. She agreed to get married because of Lina and the baby in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she had made such a choice, instead of accepting it miserably, why not face it with a smile? Besides, the child was a gift from heaven. It was something she previously dared not expect!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... want to care for you. I want to have a happy family with you!" Grace took a deep breath and said, "Jason, I don't know if we can go back to the way we used to be. Maybe we can, or maybe we can never fall in love like that again. Your heart may no longer have feelings for me, but... I still want to work on our marriage and give our child a warm family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to give her child the warmth of a family she never had. Even though the love between her and him was fragmented, she still wanted to manage it well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, if... you want a divorce after the baby is born, I'll cooperate as long as... you let me have the baby. I can promise you I won't let the child suffer with me. I'll try my best to give the baby a good environment..."</p></div>
