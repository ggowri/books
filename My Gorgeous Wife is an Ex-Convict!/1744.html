        <h1>Chapter 1742</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Joseph immediately came to his senses and took out the syringe he had prepared in advance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason punched Grace on the back with his hands almost instinctively, trying to break free from her tight embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Punch after punch, he seemed to want to break every one of her bones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... she could not let go. If she did, he would be in more danger. The longer it took to calm him down, the more danger he would be in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young Madam... let me hold Young master Reed," said Terrence after he watched Young master Reed's punches fall on Grace. Even as a man, Terrence could feel his body throbbing with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No... Help... Help me hold Jay down so Dr. Joseph can sedate him. I'm... I'm fine..." Grace said hoarsely, but her face was growing paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When another punch hit her hard, she felt something metallic in her mouth. The next second, a mouthful of blood gushed out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young Madam!" Terrence was startled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay... Don't be scared, I'm by your side. The doctor will sedate you later so you won't be in so much pain anymore..." stammered Grace. She did not care about how much pain her body was in. The only thing she cared about was how many injuries he had!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her vision began to blur a little, and she was even losing her consciousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... she could not let go of him. She wanted to wait for his pain to go away and for him to calm down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked up in a daze, trying to see the man she was holding!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes were still closed and he was still in the throes of a headache. His teeth were biting his lower lip hard, and blood gushed violently from the cuts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Don't... Don't bite your lip so hard.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Does he know how much it hurts me that he&rsquo;s bleeding?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll... stay with you. Stop... thinking about those memories. No matter what happens, I'll stay with you... Jay... I'll stay with you... till the end of time..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace murmured as her lips approached his. She just wanted him to stop biting his lip so that he would not bleed anymore...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her lips kissed his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Their blood fused...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jay... Jay...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I'll stay with you... till the end of time...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Whose voice is that? And who's saying they're going to stay with me till the end of time...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The voice seemed to be pulling him back from his agony, making the pain fade away...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's violent movements slowly stopped, and his eyes, which had been closed the entire time, slowly opened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he saw the pale face in front of him, he froze as if nothing around him existed anymore and she was the only one in the whole world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was trying to catch her breath, and there was a streak of red blood at the corners of her lips. She was saying... "Jay, don't be scared..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Don't be scared? But does she know the state she&rsquo;s in right now truly frightens me?&rsquo;</p></div>
