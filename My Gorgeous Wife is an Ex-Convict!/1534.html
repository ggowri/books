        <h1>Chapter 1532</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her two tiny hands were touching his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her easy-going behavior reminded Jason of Grace. The mother and daughter behaved the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper was very satisfied with this position. She could finally take a good look at her father. Looking at Daddy up close like this was different from looking at a photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was really her father!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll like Daddy, but you can't keep crying. Boys can't cry randomly. You need to stop crying, or everyone will know that I have a cry baby daddy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one seemed a little embarrassed. It made Jason both angry and amused. No one in Emerald City dared to find him embarrassing. The munchkin, who seemed to be his biological daughter, now looked disgusted with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After saying these words, the little one yawned as if she were a little sleepy. Her eyelids began to droop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It's so comfortable to be held by Daddy. I feel so sleepy now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one gave Jason a peck on the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her soft lips touched his cheek, and Jason instantly froze. He only felt his cheeks burning as if something had slipped through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is this... a child's kiss?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Speaking of which, he and his son had never been like this. He had never asked for it, and his son had never done it as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The relationship he shared with his son had always been average. He would provide for his son when it came to materialistic things, but the two of them never had any intimate interactions. He rarely took the initiative to hold his son even when Mick was little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His son had the maids to take care of him and the best things were at his disposal. Jason could spend more time at work that way, and he never saw any harm in that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he felt as if he had missed something because of the little one's kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As Jasper did not come out of the study, the butler and Terrence were still worried about the little one's safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They had no idea if Jason was scolding the little one in the study, or if she was so scared that she was crying. They were afraid it would cause a gap between the father and daughter in the future. After all, Jason did not get along well with his adopted daughter, Oriel Lynch, either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Terrence's phone rang. It was Jason calling. When Terrence picked up the phone, Jason only said, "Come to the study and take this child out of here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oh, okay!" Terrence quickly answered, worried that Jasper had angered Young master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once Terrence put his phone away, Grace asked, "What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Little Young Lady is in Young master Reed's study and Young master Reed asked us to bring Little Young Lady out," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll go get her," said Grace as she headed for the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace came into the study, she saw her daughter lying on Jason's shoulder... Uh, she seemed to be asleep. Her tiny hands were still holding Jason's neck.</p></div>
