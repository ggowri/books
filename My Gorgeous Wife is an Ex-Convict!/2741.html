        <h1>Chapter 2739</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it was lunchtime, and most people eating here at noon should be from nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My studio is nearby," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, you said the last time that you draw comics and have your own studio," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah." Valda Theller's eyes lit up at the mention of her career, and she started talking. When the restaurant owner served their food, Valda Theller scratched her head awkwardly. "Am I boring you with what I'm saying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's interesting," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla also said, "Yeah. My son reads comics. I always thought comics were for children. From what you said, I&rsquo;ve learned that there are many comics for adults, and I'm intrigued to read some."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll lend you some comics the next time if you want. I have a lot of comic books at home," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, thank you!" Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three ate while chatting. Kyla suddenly felt someone in the restaurant looking at them. She subconsciously looked up to find several strangers. She did not know any of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Do Grace or Valda know them?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was about to ask Grace and Valda Theller when the people suddenly got up and walked toward them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must be Ms. Kyla. We know that you're the wife of Martin Weiss, chairman of Weiss Group, right? But Martin Weiss didn't attend a charity banquet in L City with you previously. Instead, he brought another female companion. Does this mean he&rsquo;s having an affair? Do you have anything to say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One asked as they pulled out their phone and filmed Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla frowned, while Grace got up and said, "By filming without the subject's consent, you&rsquo;re violating her rights. She can pursue you legally!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her words did not have any effect. The crowd continued filming arrogantly and asked increasingly explicit and embarrassing questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Cummins Yira's expression froze as she helped Kyla block the cameras. Valda Theller also tried to stop the person from filming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person next to the one recording the scene pushed Valda Theller away and tried to pull Grace away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller panicked. After all, Grace was pregnant. It would be bad if someone pushed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she saw that someone had stood in front of Grace and shook off the person trying to pull Grace before she could rush to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Valda Theller saw several tall and strong men quickly subduing the people harassing and filming them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller blinked. 'What's... going on?' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gasped and comforted Zhong Kyla and Valda Theller. "We're alright now. They're my bodyguards. They'll take care of it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla breathed a sigh of relief. They were fortunate to have these bodyguards around. Otherwise, if something had happened to Grace...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she was pondering it, Kyla heard Valda Theller say, "Grace, are you okay? You don't look well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine..." Grace was about to deny it when she frowned suddenly and covered her belly with one of her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was suddenly a pain in her belly, which made her feel a pang in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Send... Send me to the hospital..." Grace said with difficulty. Her face turned pale, and a thin layer of sweat quickly appeared on her forehead.</p></div>
