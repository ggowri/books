        <h1>Chapter 2021</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I learned to play a new song as a birthday present for you. I hope... I hope you&rsquo;ll like it," he said somewhat nervously, embarrassed to tell her that he had no money, so he could not afford a present. This was all he could give her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately, Jasper Reed's face did not show disappointment but a look of expectation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William sat down on the piano stool, took a deep breath, and pressed his fingers heavily on the keys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was a difficult piece, and he had only heard recordings of it a few times. No one taught him the piece. He found the music score online and learned it himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had practiced secretly for days just to play the song perfectly and make her happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'She'll love the song... won't she? She has always liked music that&rsquo;s difficult to play.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could play every note correctly, but he could not evoke the right emotions. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, his music had always lacked something compared to hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He tried hard to make his music have more of what she wanted and make her like his music more, but... he could not do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His fingers played smoothly on the keys, and he made no mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">While he played, he thought about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was so happy when she appeared in his room with the cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She said she would celebrate his future birthdays in secret, and he was so happy. It would be memorable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when he thought of what his mother had done, he was afraid that Jasper would hate him when she found out how wicked his mother was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the song ended, William seemed to still be immersed in the song until a loud round of applause suddenly brought him back to his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper clapped her hands, looking happy. "Wow, William, you played so well. It's a difficult song, and what you played this time is different from the songs you played before!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Different?" he asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's like there's something extra. You used to play like a machine. The music sounds good, but something's missing. It's different now. Anyway, I think you played very, very well!" she praised generously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked blankly at her. It was the first time he had ever heard her praise his piano skills. "Did you like it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Of course, I do. Why don't you teach me how to play this song and we can play it together?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sure," he answered. As long as she liked it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William, thank you for the present. I'm so happy to have heard such a beautiful song today!" Jasper hugged William and kissed him on the cheek to express her gratitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's face instantly turned red. His cheeks felt like they were on fire, but... he loved the way she kissed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jasper, never... ever hate me, okay?" muttered William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I won't hate you," she said confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Never?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Of course!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Little by little, his restless heart seemed to quiet down. He would stay here forever and never go anywhere as long as she did not hate him!</p></div>
