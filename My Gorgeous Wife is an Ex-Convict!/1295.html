        <h1>Chapter 1294</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop the treatment?" Dr. Russell immediately frowned. "Have you forgotten what I told you about the seriousness of interrupting the treatment? Fortunately, it's not too serious since you've only stopped for a short time. If it's a year..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I'm pregnant. If we proceed with the treatment for my hands, won't it affect my babies? So we can only stop."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell's expression froze. "Indeed, your hands can't be treated in that way anymore if you're pregnant, but if you stop the treatment now, your hands may worsen. You might not even be able to clench your hands into fists."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's expression immediately changed. "How could it be?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The worst case is that your hands might be crippled," Dr. Russell added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's expression turned grimmer. "How could it be? Is there no other way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell smiled faintly. "I&rsquo;ve explained all sorts of serious possible outcomes to her before the treatment!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "In other words, I can't delay treatment for a year?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not that you can't get treatment anymore. It's just that the pain will be much more painful than anything you've ever experienced before. Besides, if the condition of your hands worsens and they&rsquo;re rendered crippled before treatment, then no treatment would work."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's expression had completely sunk. He could not accept the fact that her hands were going to be crippled and that the treatment was going to be more painful a year later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had seen her undergone treatment once. He had shuddered when he saw the needle knife stab into her hand without any anesthesia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ordinary people could hardly bear the pain, let alone a more intense pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I can find you a better doctor in the country and abroad. I'll cure your hands no matter what!" Jason said in a deep voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not sure about overseas, but I'm the only one who can cure her hands in the country," Dr. Russell said bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's thin lips were pressed tightly into a straight line, and his face turned grimmer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I see. Thank you, Dr. Russell! If my hands aren't crippled a year later, I'll have to trouble you to treat them again," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell stared at Grace. "Aren't you afraid that these hands of yours will be crippled?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My babies matter more. I could die for them. It's just a pair of hands. It's no big deal." Grace smiled lightly as if she was nonchalant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way Dr. Russell looked at Grace with admiration. "Then I'll prescribe you some medicine. Soak your feet with the decoction, and you can apply the residue to your hands. Three times a week. It's suitable for pregnant women!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell wrote her a prescription as he spoke. He asked Grace to go to the pharmacy and fill the prescription.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, Dr. Russell," Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't need to thank me. The prescription is only to relieve the joint pain during your pregnancy. It can't guarantee that your hands won't be crippled," Dr. Russell said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled. She knew Dr. Russell's bark was worse than his bite. She thanked him again and left with Jason.</p></div>
