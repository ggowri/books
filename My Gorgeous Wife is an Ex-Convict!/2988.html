        <h1>Chapter 2986</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's easy to say, but difficult to do," said Valda. "My previous English was mostly focused on written exams, so I rarely practiced speaking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This is also a drawback of learning English in China. Many times, people only study for the purpose of passing exams, and they rarely use English in their daily lives. As a result, they lack the language environment to practice and improve their skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So for this month, I can practice speaking with you so that you can adapt more quickly," Brian said. "Then, for everyday greetings and conversations, I can speak to you in English."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's eyes lit up, "Oh, you also know English! How good is your English?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He then opened his mouth and a string of English words came out directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes brightened, even though she only understood half of what he said. This also indicated that his English was pretty good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So this month, let's communicate more in English."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," he replied, "I'll help you find some relevant books later. Let me give you some extra tutoring this month."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">My boyfriend is helping me with my English tutoring... Valda suddenly thought of the school stories in comics and TV dramas, where it's common to see boyfriends helping their girlfriends with their homework. She never expected that at her age, she would experience it herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, as expected, Brian brought her several books to study. He also started communicating with her in English for everyday conversations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And when she doesn't understand or forgets how to respond, he patiently teaches her again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda couldn't help but sigh, thinking that if her English teacher had been like him back then, her English would probably be better now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During an unintentional conversation, she found out that he had a lot of English proficiency certificates, including a perfect score of 9 on the IELTS exam. She was so impressed that she almost worshipped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During his time in school, he was probably a straight-A student.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you ever tutored anyone before?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Am I the first?" She blinked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, you're the first," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda felt honored to be the first person he helped with English tutoring. She thought happily to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Patrick found out that Brian was tutoring Valda in English, he couldn't believe it and said to Valda, "She's tutoring you? Oh my god, you know, I begged him so many times to tutor me, but he refused!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he said this, Patrick held his chest as if he was heartbroken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian seemed indifferent and said, "Your family hired a tutor for you, there's no need for me to tutor you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But it's not the same. You've tutored Valda, and we've been friends for so many years. Can't you tutor me too?" Patrick said. "I feel like my English has deteriorated a lot recently, and I need tutoring urgently."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not like Valda," Brian said flatly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You value love over friendship!" Patrick shouted. "Valda, I'll have to rely on you in the future. If Brian bullies me, you have to stand up for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda laughed at Patrick's words. She thought it was nice to have a friend like Patrick around, especially with Brian's cold personality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In private, Patrick said to Valda, "Valda, I've noticed that since you've been with Brian, he's been smiling a lot more. So, I hope that in the future, you won't easily give up on Brian. Give him some more time. I don't think there will be anyone else like you who can bring so much joy to him."</p></div>
