        <h1>Chapter 2784</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse at the blood collection counter tied the tube skillfully. Then, she patted Valda Theller's arm to confirm the location of the blood draw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hold her still while I draw her blood," the nurse warned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Brian. He let Valda Theller rest her upper body in his arms while he pressed one hand on her shoulder and the other on her right arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as the sharp needle entered her arm, Valda Theller instinctively wanted to withdraw her arm to shake off the pain, but Brian grabbed her firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ouch..." she shouted pitifully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It'll only take a minute. Bear with it," he said patiently. Come to think of it, he had never been so patient with a woman except for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When her blood was drawn, Brian held Valda Theller in his arms and waited for the blood test result, which took 15 minutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he was sure she was no longer bleeding where the needle had pricked her, he got up and threw the cotton ball into the trash can nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he returned to his chair, he found her looking up with her drunken round eyes fixed on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I just had my blood drawn..." Her voice stammered as her head swayed from side to side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was still drunk but somewhat sober.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Yeah. You don't have to have your blood drawn anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kiss... Burp... Can I kiss you... now..." she asked as she hiccupped and threw her head back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together tightly. She might not have asked if she had been sober.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sighed gently, bent over, looked her straight in the eye, and said, "You'll regret it when you sober up..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I won't regret it... You said... you'll let me do it... after I got my blood drawn..." She put her hands around his neck again and gawked at his face. "Brian... Why... Why don't you let me kiss you? I... really want to be your real girlfriend..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You already are," he said solemnly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She mumbled, "I... already am? Can I... kiss you whenever I want... Burp... That way, will you get used to me... Will you... like me more?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, moving her face closer to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their faces were so close now that he could feel her breathing and see himself in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was still drunk, but the longing in her eyes and the wet tears on her face made it impossible for him to say no.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Will she cry again if I tell her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, she said she wanted me to fall for her when I told her I wanted a real relationship with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If we're more intimate, will I get used to her presence and even... fall for her without knowing it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I do fall for her, everyone will be happy. Grace will be elated too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace... Grace...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the name just crossed his mind, it gave his heart a pang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you think you won't regret it, then... okay." Brian slowly opened his thin lips and uttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, the silly smile appeared on Valda Theller&rsquo;s face again, and she pressed her lips hard against his.</p></div>
