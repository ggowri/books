        <h1>Chapter 1679</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Let go of me... Are you trying to rob me in broad daylight?" shouted Zoe Stevens.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her voice instantly immediately attracted the attention of everyone in the hospital. Sean also saw what was going on. He rushed over when he saw his sister being surrounded by several men. "What are you trying to do?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They said, "Your sister took photos of something she shouldn't have. She wouldn&rsquo;t give us her phone, so this is the only way to do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What do you mean by that? What did she take photos of? Who the hell are you guys? Let go of my sister!" shouted Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"They're my men, they won't let go unless I tell them to!" A cold voice rang behind Sean, making his blood freeze for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'This voice belongs to... Jason!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was the man who suppressed the Stevens family and made them lose everything. He was also the man Grace had fallen in love with. He was the last person one should mess with... in Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean turned around almost in slow motion, only to find that everyone around him had disappeared. A row of security guards was standing in the distance, keeping everyone away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sure enough, it was... Jason! He could even command the hospital&rsquo;s security guards and vacate a space like this in a matter of seconds!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The bodyguard brought over Zoe Stevens's phone to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason easily unlocked the phone as there was no password. He scrolled through the photo album and saw the photos Zoe Stevens had taken just now. A sarcastic smile appeared on the corners of his mouth, but his eyes were cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"See for yourself the photos she took." Jason tossed the phone to Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean's expression instantly changed when he saw the photos on her phone. He turned to look at Zoe Stevens with disbelief in his eyes. "Zoe, why... Why did you take these photos?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Zoe Stevens's eyes glimmered. She seemed to be a little guilty. "Brother, I just randomly took them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You hid here to take them. You call that random?" Sean said grimly. He could sort of figure out the purpose of his sister taking these photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was all the more embarrassing since he could figure out why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm telling you, forget about asking for money. I willingly saved Grace, and I never expected anything in return!" said Sean. Even so, Grace still paid for their mother's medical bills!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Brother, Grace owes our family. If it weren't for her, would our family turn out like this?" said Zoe Stevens as she blamed Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason suddenly sneered. "So do I owe the Stevens family too? I was the one who went after the Stevens family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Zoe Stevens's face instantly paled. How could she forget about him? The Stevens family had problems at the beginning because of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean took a deep breath and said to Jason, "Mr. Reed, I don't want to talk about it anymore. I'm not going to ask Grace for anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason slowly walked up to Sean, his handsome face full of cold sternness. "Since you're not going to ask for anything, don't appear in front of Grace again&mdash;let alone talk to her about your memories together. Even if you did love her once, she&rsquo;ll never have anything to do with you again after this!"</p></div>
