        <h1>Chapter 3594</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Huh?" Jasper was taken aback and glanced at William standing beside him from the corner of his eye. Then he replied somewhat awkwardly, "No...not yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then consider how about our William?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Ahem..." Jasper almost choked on her own saliva.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"My old bones, I don't know how much longer they can hold up. What I fear most is that if I close my eyes one day, our William won't even have a girlfriend," the old man sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jasper quickly said, "How could that be? William will definitely have a girlfriend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Really?" The old Mr. Barlow's eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jasper suddenly realized that her response just now sounded like she was saying she would be William's girlfriend, as if she was talking to her own grandfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, facing the old man's hopeful gaze, she could only force herself to say, "Really."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's good, that's good. Then, when William has children, I can also close my eyes," the old man said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jasper's face turned completely red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">William quickly said, "Grandpa, that's enough, let's not talk about this anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay, I won't say anything then," the old man said, giving his grandson a look that said "I'm helping you out." This left William feeling both amused and exasperated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, the old man was still sick and soon became tired, falling asleep again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jasper and William left the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't worry about what my grandfather said earlier," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Um...about what I said to my grandfather just now...," she bit her lip, feeling a bit uneasy as she considered what words to use.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I know you're only saying this for your grandfather's sake, and I won't regret anything because of it. I'll continue to wait for you to think it over and give me an answer, and you don't need to rush to respond," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What he wanted wasn't for her to reluctantly be with him due to a moment of embarrassment, but for a lifetime together!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Therefore, he didn't mind waiting!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His words made her breathe a sigh of relief. He seemed to always be like this, not putting pressure on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"William, do you know? You're a lot like a spring breeze," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Spring breeze?" He raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, it's warm and gentle, it doesn't give people pressure. Being with you gives a very comfortable feeling." She said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He chuckled, probably only she would feel this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His interactions with other people were not like this.</p></div>
