        <h1>Chapter 3304</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And from the way the other person spoke just now, it seemed like they knew someone named Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I am," Valda said. "And you are?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person took off their mask, and Valda immediately recognized the person in front of her as Taelyn! A powerful actor who had been popular for a while 10 years ago, and although not as popular now, still considered a strong actor who appeared in supporting roles on TV.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello," Valda said. "You're Taelyn, right? I've seen your TV dramas."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Encountering celebrity actors in the hospital was not strange to Valda, as many people from the entertainment industry came to this hospital, especially those who came for obstetrics and gynecology clinics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello," Taelyn said, looking at Valda's obviously pregnant belly with some emotion. "I never thought I'd meet you here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked puzzled. "Do you need something?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not really, I just wanted to chat with you," Taelyn said. "When I first met Brian, I thought that a man like him, even if he really wanted to marry, would only marry a high-class lady who was elegant and intellectual, or a stunningly beautiful woman. Otherwise, I can't imagine what kind of woman would be worthy of him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was surprised. "You know Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taelyn laughed. "Who in the entertainment industry doesn't know the prince of the industry? I was lucky enough to be his girlfriend for three months back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Huh?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's eyes widened suddenly, "You...you are his ex-girlfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is she one of your ex-girlfriends? What, you don't know?" the other person asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked embarrassed, she really didn't know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at her expression, Taelyn said, "Back then, when Brian and I were dating, it even made it to the news and was a hot topic, so quite a few people knew about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um... at that time, I probably didn't pay much attention to this kind of gossip news," Valda said sheepishly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is her first time facing her husband's ex-girlfriend seriously, and for a moment, she doesn't know what expression to use to face her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two women, just like that, looked at each other...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside the restroom, Brian glanced down at his watch and furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time has passed for a while now, I hope nothing unexpected has happened to Valda inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he had known, he should have had the female bodyguard come along today, so it would have been easier to go in and check on Valda's situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, two women came out of the restroom. One of them said, "That was Taelyn in the restroom just now. I heard it's easy to run into famous actors here. This place is really great!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, Taelyn was quite pretty back then, and she still looks good now. It's just a shame that she was supposed to be the main character, but now she can only be a supporting character."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, do you know the woman who was chatting with Taelyn? Is she also an actress?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That doesn't look like her. That woman's belly is a bit big, she might be pregnant and possibly a friend of Taelyn's."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two women were talking and gradually walking away from each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Brian suddenly shuddered and his body stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taelyn, that is... one of his ex-girlfriends from years ago. It seems like they only dated for a few months, so it was a pretty brief relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To put it simply, the women he dated back then didn't last very long in terms of the duration of their relationships.</p></div>
