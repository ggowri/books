        <h1>Chapter 3589</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her pitch-black pupils, it seemed like her figure was slowly becoming the only thing visible. However, the way he looked at her was different from William's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When William looked at her, his gaze was gentle yet fiery. When he said he liked her, she had no doubt about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Roger also said he liked her, yet his gaze didn't give her the same feeling of being liked. Instead, it made her feel a sense of danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why, don't you believe me?" Roger whispered as he slowly leaned down. His handsome face enlarged in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She instinctively wanted to step back, but his hand suddenly grabbed her waist, stopping her from retreating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face was close, his breath spraying on her face, and his sexy lips slowly opened, "So what do I have to do for you to believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She bit her lip and stared at the clear and elegant face in front of her, "If you really like someone, you shouldn't treat that feeling as a condition for a transaction. If the other person is only dating you because of a transaction, what's the point of that kind of relationship?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But isn't it meaningful to keep the person you like by your side?" Roger said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if the other person doesn't like you back, it doesn't matter?" she asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay, because I know she will eventually fall in love with me," he said with a confident look in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was stunned. The way this person spoke made it seem like he was telling the truth and truly believed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You...are really confident," she chuckled nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it bad to be confident?" he asked in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had no response and remained silent for a while before saying, "I won't date someone just because of a business deal. I will only date someone I truly like."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, a slight smile appeared on his lips. "Then wait until you fall in love with me, and we can start dating."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face immediately turned red. "What makes you so sure that I will like you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you believe in destiny?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"From the moment I first laid eyes on you, I knew that we were destined to be together," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, they are destined to have a doomed fate with each other!" he silently said to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Jasper returned to the dormitory, he saw the other three roommates staring at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's going on?" she asked, confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, you and Roger are together now, why didn't you say anything?" Meave said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Horea followed up, "Do you want to keep it a secret?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nina added, "Although I still think William is better, it's understandable that childhood sweethearts are often no match for a new handsome guy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper felt a headache coming on and asked, "What are you guys talking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Someone posted your photos on the school forum. You're not planning to deny it, are you?" Meave said, pulling up the forum post and showing it to Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The post contained photos of Jasper and Roger talking together today, which was the same day the photos were taken.</p></div>
