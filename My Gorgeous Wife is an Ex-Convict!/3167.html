        <h1>Chapter 3165</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda lifted her hand and held the other's face. "I'm serious. Just seeing you can lift my spirits. Sometimes, I even get mesmerized by you and think, 'My fianc&eacute; is so handsome, I really want to kiss him!' It feels like just looking at you a little longer can make a person feel so much more relaxed and comfortable!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, then you should look at me more in the future. I have a lifetime to show you!" he said, leaning down, wanting to kiss her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hands quickly pressed against his lips. This was the entrance to the rehabilitation room, and people were coming and going. "I...I'll go take a shower and change my clothes first. Wait for me, okay?" she said, blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her shy and cute appearance made his heart flutter. He kissed the palm of her hand and said, "Okay, I'll wait for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face turned as red as blood, and it took her a while to finally enter the nearby bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Brian waited outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, he would wait for her...no matter how long it took!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After leaving the rehabilitation center, Brian asked Valda while driving, "Where do you want to eat tonight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anywhere is fine," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well..." he started to say, but his phone suddenly rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian picked up his phone and answered the call. After a moment, he furrowed his brow slightly and said, "Okay, I'll see how things go later." With that, he ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda asked suspiciously, "What's wrong? Do you have something to do now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not just me, it's us," he said. "My mom said that some relatives are having dinner at their place today, and one of them expressed interest in meeting you and asked if we could come over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was taken aback, is this... about meeting relatives?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you don't want to go, then don't go," said Brian. "Anyway, if we don't meet today, we'll have plenty of opportunities to meet in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He doesn't want to force her, and besides, he's not in a hurry to meet these relatives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then go ahead," said Valda. "As you said, if you don't meet today, you'll meet in the future. It's better to meet sooner rather than later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's just meet briefly and have a simple meal, then we can go back to the villa early," he said, knowing that she didn't enjoy this kind of socializing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm." She nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda and Brian arrived at the Hart family's mansion and entered the living room where they saw many people of all ages and genders. They were likely all relatives of the Hart family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All of their gazes are now fixed on Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, is this your fianc&eacute;e Miss Theller?" A middle-aged woman spoke up after a moment.</p></div>
