        <h1>Chapter 2760</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If an animated film was to be played in cinemas, the time and money needed were far greater than ordinary films, which was why there were so few animated films.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can help you if you really want to be an animation director," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was startled. She would have thought it a joke if it had come from an ordinary person. However, it would... come true if it came from Brian's mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because Brian could do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hurriedly said as she waved her hands. "No, no! I'm not good enough to direct an animated film yet. Besides, animations are investments with huge risks. I don't want you to help me when I'm incapable of it yet. You&rsquo;ll lose a lot of money. I'd better stick to doing what I'm capable of."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter even if I lose a lot of money. But since you don't want to, I'll invest in your animation when you think you're capable enough in the future, okay?" said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled and did not refuse. Instead, she said, "Okay, it's a deal!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the two came to the movie theater, Valda Theller suddenly said, "Please wait here for me. I'll only take a minute." With that said, she ran to the other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian saw her run to the concession stand to buy popcorn and two bottles of soft drinks. Then, she jogged back to him while holding a big bucket of popcorn in her arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's have popcorn together later. By the way, I got us Coke. Do you want some? I'll get you another one if you don't drink Coke, "she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. Coke is fine," he said, only thinking she looked like a child as she held the big bucket of popcorn in her arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller booked the tickets when Brian was driving. Valda Theller looked around after they walked into the theater. Although the animated film had a wide audience and was not childish, many families of three came. They could see many children in the theater hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems many kids came to watch it," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The animated film is suitable for a wide age range," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wonder when I can bring my kids to watch animations too," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said it unintentionally, only lamenting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at her and asked, "Do you want to watch animations with your children?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah..." She suddenly paused and blushed. She said it like she could not wait to have children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller blushed as she stammered, "I... I'm just saying I want to watch animations with my kids someday. I... I mean nothing else. Don't overthink it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if amused, he looked at her blushed face. "What do you think I'll 'overthink'?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh, forget I ever said anything.' Her face was almost buried in the popcorn. Fortunately, the movie soon started, and Valda Theller was finally relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Clear Blue Skies was a story about a little girl who saved a little white dragon by chance. The little white dragon wanted to repay the kindness when he grew up. He desperately searched for his savior. However, when he met the little girl who had grown up, he mistook someone else for his savior as he did not recognize her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little white dragon harmed the girl to repay the fake savior. It was too late when he found out who his true savior was. The girl had turned into dust and disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the little white dragon kept looking for the person the girl reincarnated into. However, he learned that the girl already had someone she loved when he finally found her. She loved that person very much. Unfortunately, the girl fell seriously ill. Even the doctor diagnosed that she was near death.</p></div>
