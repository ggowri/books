        <h1>Chapter 2551</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his body stayed stiff, and he stood still as his eyes watched Louise Mitchell's lips open and close. She said... "She said there's no way she'd give you up to anyone. She loved you and had promised to be with you forever. She said she only thought of Herman Moss as a friend and had never loved Herman Moss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His blood seemed to freeze when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart hurt like it was stabbed by countless sharp daggers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory staggered back a few steps... He looked like he was on the verge of collapsing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Was I the only one Amber Mitchell loved?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She never had anything going on with Herman Moss?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If... of all this is true, what have I done? How could I have treated her like that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory, you're the real villain. You're paranoid and jealous. Even though you loved Amber Mitchell, you didn&rsquo;t believe her. I didn't put Amber Mitchell in that position. You did! If you had trusted Amber Mitchell a little more, you would have been a harmonious and beautiful family of three now. It's a pity that Amber Mitchell hates you so much now&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A cold slap interrupted the rest of Louise Mitchell's speech.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was slapped so hard that she almost fell to the ground, but she did not seem to feel any pain. She just looked at George Gregory hysterically and said with a laugh, "George Gregory, you'll suffer worse than me. You'll never get what you want. You&rsquo;ll end up alone in suffering. You&rsquo;ll regret it all your life..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her shrill voice was like a curse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory stumbled away with a pale face. He wanted to find Amber Mitchell. He had so much to say to Amber Mitchell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a swollen cheek, Louise Mitchell laughed until George Gregory left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sarcasm on her face then changed to self-deprecating sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She now needed to use Amber Mitchell to hurt George Gregory and make him suffer. How ridiculous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell, George Gregory, I curse that you&rsquo;ll never be together. Never!" Louise Mitchell mumbled. In her opinion, her life was ruined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not have any future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as George Gregory got out, he called his subordinates. "Where&rsquo;s Amber Mitchell? Help me find her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to see Amber Mitchell. He wanted to tell Amber Mitchell that Simon was their child! He also wanted to tell her that he was sorry. He was really sorry. He should not have doubted her. He should not have turned his back on her when she was at her worst!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had done so many wrong things, and he only realized them now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was surprised when he got a reply from his subordinate. "What? She and the Moss family went to the Moss family's cemetery?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, and Miss Mitchell went there wearing a wedding dress today," the subordinate said.</p></div>
