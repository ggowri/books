        <h1>Chapter 4234 Getting along better</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, she looked up at the handsome face in front of her, and a certain desire </span><span>suddenly arose in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This desire was so familiar as if she had longed for it countless times before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at this moment, she didn't want to suppress this sudden desire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler, I want to kiss you," Tina whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler was taken aback and looked at her with some surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to, you can refuse," she added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but smile. How could he refuse? Because this was what he longed for!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't mind, I'm happy," he responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing his answer, Tina's lips met Chandler's as she had wished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A shallow kiss, the touch of their lips, that familiar feeling but still overwhelming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The desire, instead of being satisfied, makes her want more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wants to deepen this kiss, to be more intimate with him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kiss, unconsciously, becomes deeper and deeper!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Until she's almost out of breath, she finally stops the kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Blushing, she calms her breathing, "How was that kiss just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Very good," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thinks for a moment and boldly says, "Since you thought it was good, can we kiss more in the future? After all, it might help deepen our connection."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler feels a little happy inside as if Tina has slowly returned to her old self.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only, in the past, she would demand "more kisses" more confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, it should be said that she has always been Tina, but now she has temporarily forgotten him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina stays with Chandler until the evening before returning to the Stephenson family with his escort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina, concerned, asks her daughter, "How did you get along with Chandler today?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pretty good," Tina says, "We should consider ourselves dating now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina looks a bit strange because legally, they are already married and have a child. So they're only dating now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Mom, we've chosen a name for the child," Tina says, "It's Quinn Hunter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quinn?" Lina pauses.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Quinn. It's the name Chandler chose. I picked it from the names he suggested for the child, and I really like it," Tina says.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's a lovely name," Lina smiles, "Quinn, it's great!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tomorrow, Chandler and I will go to register the child," Tina says.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They haven't registered the child yet because they haven't chosen a name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the following days, after registering the child with Chandler, Tina, and Chandler would visit the hospital together every day. When Chandler was working, she would rest in his office and take a few photos of him with her phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would also bring some school stuff to his office and look through them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she has missed too many courses, and when she returns to school, she'll probably have to start from the third year again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Days go by like this, their interactions becoming more and more natural.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One day, Tina, in the office, looks at Chandler who is reviewing documents, and suddenly asks, "How did our first time making love happen?"</span></p></div>
