        <h1>Chapter 3248</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin raised his eyebrows slightly, while Kyla stood up and made an inviting gesture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Weiss, how about dancing with me?" She smiled at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you still remember the steps?" He asked, looking somewhat surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, she seemed to be constantly doing things that surprised him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I remember what you taught me," she said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was taken aback for a moment, then a faint smile appeared on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, he had taught her ballroom dancing. He didn't know how many times she had stepped on his feet when he taught her the steps, but even so, he still wanted to teach her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because her apologetic expression with a red face was cute, because her serious learning expression was cute, and because her proud expression when she danced better and better was cute...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These cutenesses made him want to keep looking at her like this forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin stood up and gently took Kyla's hand, and they began to dance slowly just like they used to, surrounded by candlelight and music.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin was surprised because he thought Kyla hadn't danced in a long time and might be rusty or step on his feet a lot. However, this was not the case. They seemed to have an exceptional understanding and danced together as if it had only been a few years since they last danced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the song ended, Kyla gently tiptoed and held Martin's face with both hands, taking the initiative to kiss his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hesitated for a moment, but then quickly reached out and wrapped his arm around her waist, leaning down slightly to respond to her kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kiss is passionate and intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After an unknown amount of time, the two finally ended their kiss. Kyla gazed steadily at the man in front of her, gently caressing his face with her fingers. "Martin, I love you. No matter what happens in the future, please remember that I love you. You can doubt anything, but...never doubt that I love you, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her expression was too serious at the moment, causing a hint of unease to pass through his heart. He furrowed his brows and asked, "What's wrong? Did something happen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla shook her head slowly, took a deep breath, and said each word carefully, "Martin, for life, for eternity, you must never think of leaving me again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she said this sentence, he was completely stunned. The sentence was...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You--" His pupils suddenly contracted, staring at her in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla's eyes turned red, and a layer of mist filled her eyes. "Martin, I want to lift the hypnosis you put on me. I don't want to live in fear of accidentally saying the trigger phrase to release the hypnosis and jeopardizing our future together. So, I want to take the initiative to do this. After you lift the hypnosis, I hope you remember what I just said to you - that I love you, and it's genuine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His brow furrowed gradually, and waves of pain kept coming to his mind. His heart was beating intensely, yet exceptionally clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clear enough that he could count his own heartbeat with each beat.</p></div>
