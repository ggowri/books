        <h1>Chapter 4368 Buying a Hat at the Amusement Park</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While Calvert was still in a daze, Harley had already pulled him into a nearby shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were quite a few shops in the amusement park, selling related merchandise. Most of these items were fluffy toys and toys printed with cartoon patterns.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to buy something?" Calvert asked, somewhat puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm-hmm." She responded, leading him to a stack of containers. She picked up a hat with a cartoon pattern on it, then said to him, "Bend down a little."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert obediently bent down, and Harley placed the hat he was holding onto his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert suddenly stiffened, staring blankly at Harley's face, which was so close to his. He watched her red lips move as she said, "This should cover it up more, hopefully, no one will notice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she was the one who picked out this hat for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body stiffened even more, simply because her fingers were playing with the hair at the edge of his hat, helping him tidy up his strands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because they were so close, he could even feel her breath, fresh and elegant, as if it carried a hint of the morning breeze. He couldn't help but hold his breath, his heart pounding faster and faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why are you so quiet?" Harley's voice suddenly rang out, snapping Calvert out of his daze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh? What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think of this hat?" Harley asked. "If you don't like it, we can look for other colors or styles. Just keep in mind that most hats you can buy here will probably have cartoon designs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I really like it." He gently lowered his eyelids, using them to hide the confusion in his eyes, afraid she would see his feelings for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Luckily</span><span> he was still wearing a mask then, otherwise, she would have noticed how red his face had become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good." Harley breathed a sigh of relief, "Let's buy this hat then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," he agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it came time to pay, Harley insisted on picking up the tab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can this be!" Calvert said anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's stopping us? Today is your birthday, consider this as my birthday gift to you!" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you're already here with me, that's a birthday gift in itself," said Calvert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley laughed, "Whoever complained about too many gifts? It's your birthday today, can't I spoil you a little more?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley paid the bill and then asked the clerk for a pair of small scissors. He asked Calvert to bend down and cut off the tag from his hat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert bent over again, bowing in front of Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was carefully using the scissors, and many of the tourists coming in and out of the shop were watching him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Harley was pretty and adorable. Although Calvert was wearing a hat and mask, making it hard to see his face, the way he leaned toward the girl looked just like a scene from a movie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright!" Harley said, after cutting off the tag from the hat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert shot </span><span>up,</span><span> all he could hear was his own heart pounding fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go, we can have a good look around now. What do you feel like doing?" Harley said, naturally taking Calvert's hand and leading the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He followed her steps, staring blankly at her figure. His heart was beating rapidly as if telling him how much he yearned for her!</span></p></div>
