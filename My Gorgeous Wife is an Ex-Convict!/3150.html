        <h1>Chapter 3148</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did someone like her become Brian's fianc&eacute;e?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is the prince blind?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The live stream was filled with speculation and insults, but Valda remained calm and introduced herself, "I'm Valda, and I'm also Brian's fianc&eacute;e. As for how Brian fell for me, that's between him and me. I've always believed that love isn't about being chosen, but about falling in love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In addition, due to some personal matters, I have been using public resources for a while, and I feel very sorry about it. Regarding the unrealistic comments about Tracy and Miss Barlow, I have explained before, but it seems that many people do not believe my explanation. Therefore, today, I plan to play a video so that everyone can have a clearer understanding of what happened at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda played the video footage of the party surveillance on the live broadcast without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After playing at normal speed once, they began to play some targeted details.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now everyone can clearly see that on that day, Valda fell down and was prevented from getting up by someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, although there is a video, it cannot prove whether Valda fell on her own or was tripped by someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, on that day, both she and the other person were wearing long dresses, and the distance of the surveillance camera was far, so it's normal that she couldn't see clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most netizens have stopped attacking and insulting Valda in the live broadcast room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, there are still a few netizens who shout, "If you fall, you fall. Who says someone has to help you up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, helping you is a matter of kindness, but not helping is also a duty. You're trying to morally blackmail me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Moral hypocrite, did you get angry just because someone didn't help you up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at these comments, Valda replied, "First of all, I have to say that I fell because they tripped me. Secondly, in the surveillance video that I released, it is very clear that every time I tried to get up, they stopped me. There was even one person who stepped on my hand. Before you criticize me, shouldn't you ask Tracy how many lies she has told?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who knows if they accidentally stepped on you! You tend to be more accident-prone because of your limp. If you weren't limping, you wouldn't have fallen!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think that you have done a lot of bad things, that's why God made you limp! Tsk tsk, it's true that you reap what you sow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the live stream room, someone appeared with a rhythm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite such remarks, Valda was already mentally prepared for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when faced with the real situation, the heart keeps sinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her leg is lame...it's her pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially for someone who used to be healthy, able to run and jump, everything seemed so natural and taken for granted. But when suddenly one day they become lame, they realize that what used to be effortless is now not so easy anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kind of pain is difficult for others to understand!</p></div>
