        <h1>Chapter 414</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was reminded of when Brian helped her with her shoelaces yesterday, so... Was he jealous?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was Jason jealous? It was something Grace had not thought about before, but it seemed sweet to think about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sunburnt?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked out of the window at the sky. It was cloudy today with the sun obscured by the clouds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, Nelson is going to have an operation soon. My mother and I are going to the hospital to take care of Nelson for a few days, so I'll close the restaurant while we're there. However, don't worry, you'll get paid as usual," said Kyla Corbyn. "I'll send you a message when the restaurant reopens."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," replied Grace. "Let me know when Nelson's operation is over. I want to know that his operation went well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right," Kyla Corbyn said with a smile. "I hope that his operation goes well too." Although closing the restaurant for a few days would affect business, her son's hearing was now the most important thing to her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Nelson had his cochlear implant, she would have many other things to face, such as how to translate the sounds he was hearing into language so that he could not only understand but also speak. All of these were difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was now ready to face those difficulties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how hard it was, she would try her best to let Nelson listen and speak like a normal child. That way, his life would be filled with fewer hurdles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When business was slower in the afternoon, Kyla Corbyn went back to the house at the back of the restaurant and looked at Nelson who was asleep in Mrs. Corbyn's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was now carefully putting Nelson on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you here? " asked Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just wanted to see Nelson while I'm free," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you see enough of him? Nelson will be hospitalized tomorrow. You will have to look at Nelson for almost 24 hours. That should be enough for you," Mrs. Corbyn said with a smile, obviously looking forward to her grandson's surgery the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at her son with love. "I did him wrong. If I hadn't taken the wrong medicine at that time, maybe he wouldn't have been deaf at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not your fault. It's all that wicked woman's fault!" Mrs. Corbyn got angry as she spoke of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was stupid, I didn't see through her," said Kyla Corbyn. "It's just that Nelson&hellip; ought to be God's favored one, but he has a mother like me. Look at how he&rsquo;s living now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn looked at her daughter in distress. "What are you saying? Nelson is lucky to have a mother like you. Enough, stop discouraging yourself. It's Nelson's surgery day tomorrow. After the surgery, we still have a lot to do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, I'll stop discouraging myself!" Kyla Corbyn once again lowered her head to kiss her son's tender cheeks and went back to the restaurant in front.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she got back to the restaurant, she saw an unexpected person there and was horrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian&hellip; was here again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn never expected Brian to reappear in her restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why was he here again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn subconsciously thought of the video she saw yesterday. In the video, Brian's attitude toward Grace and the way he looked at Grace...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was Brian here because of Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Brian asked Kyla Corbyn next confirmed her speculations.</p></div>
