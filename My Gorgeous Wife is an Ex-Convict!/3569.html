        <h1>Chapter 3567</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper quickly said, "I'll help you throw it away!" and then picked up the empty milk tea cup and left quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger's eyes flickered as he stared at her back, seemingly lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper walked quickly until she was sure she was out of Roger's sight, then carefully put on a disposable surgical glove and carefully pulled out the straw Roger had used from the milk tea cup, intending to put it in the storage bag she had prepared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a voice suddenly sounded, "What are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's hand shook and the straw fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The habit of dropping things on the ground is considered contaminated. Even if it is picked up again, it cannot be considered a good sample for extracting DNA!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper felt a wave of regret in her heart. As she looked up, she met Roger's pretty face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I didn't do anything," she said, her voice revealing a sense of guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" He approached, crouched down, and picked up the straw from the ground. "What were you planning to do with this straw?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well...aren't we friends? So I wanted to collect some things from my friends," she finally managed to come up with this reason. But after saying it out loud, she herself felt that it was a lame excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can't tell, you have this strange quirk of collecting straws, huh?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sweated profusely, feeling like a pervert in his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about you? Why are you here? Shouldn't you be sitting on the rest area side?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just thought it was strange that there's a trash can on the rest area side, but you insist on coming here to throw it away. So I followed to take a look, and I didn't expect you to have such a hobby," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was speechless by his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He threw the straw in his hand into the trash can and said, "Alright, I've bought the book I was looking for. Let's go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper bit her lip, feeling frustrated. It was her first attempt, but it ended in failure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them walked out of the bookstore, but Roger suddenly stopped in front of a shop window on their way back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was surprised to see that the window displayed many dolls, including a three-story wooden dollhouse and various wooden furniture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These things are usually played with by girls pretending to be homemakers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger, on the other hand, was watching with great concentration, his gaze as if he was reminiscing about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you interested in playing house?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, it's usually girls who are interested in it, and it's rare for boys to be interested, especially since Roger is already a college student.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He turned his head, his black eyes looking at her deeply, and in his gaze, there seemed to be a kind of reproach.</p></div>
