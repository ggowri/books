        <h1>Chapter 991</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the pain she imagined was slow to come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but open her eyes, only to see him holding her hand. He seemed to be looking at it intently before he asked softly, "Does it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, an emotion that she could not explain came over her. It made her nose somewhat sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always given her the illusion that he cherished her very much, but the fact was, he could easily abandon her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, don't kiss me if you don't love me! Don't ask me whether the hand I used to slap you on the face hurts. You&rsquo;ll only disgust me!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She glared at him, forcefully pulling her hand out of his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her long hair was unkempt while her face was red and pale. A few strands of hair stuck to her cheek, and there was an obvious trace of resistance in those jet-black almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face turned pale immediately as he staggered. Then, a sickening sensation came over him. He covered his mouth with his hands, stumbled out of bed, and headed for the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the next second, Grace heard the sound of vomiting in the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He must have drunk too much that he&rsquo;s now throwing up. It might do him some good!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got out of bed and looked down at her right hand. The pain from having given that slap was still lingering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but give a wry smile. It seemed that hitting someone would cause her pain as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of vomiting in the bathroom gradually went away. Jason still had not come out of the bathroom after a long time, though. Grace guessed that he had passed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked to the bathroom door and knocked before asking, "Jason, are... Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no reply after a short wait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she had to raise her voice. "Jason, can you hear me? Are you so drunk that you&rsquo;ve fallen asleep in there? Why don't I&hellip; knock three more times, and if you don't open the door, I'll come in!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she bent her fingers and knocked on the bathroom door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After three knocks, there was still no movement inside. The door remained closed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then turned the handle and pushed open the door. She was only glad Jason had not locked the door from the inside. Otherwise, she would have had to get a locksmith.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the bathroom, a figure was crouching in the corner. He seemed&hellip; to have passed out after being too drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sighed inwardly. 'He's really drunk!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She went forward and bent over to help him to bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only when she bent over that she realized it was not what she had imagined at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would be shivering every now and then. Although his eyes were tightly closed, his lips were pressed into a straight line. He was frowning, and his face was as white as a sheet of paper. Beads of sweat oozed from his forehead, trickling down his cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He doesn't look like he fell asleep because he&rsquo;s too drunk!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said quickly, "What's the matter? Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyelashes quivered, and he slowly opened his eyes. Her face was reflected in those dark eyes of his. "Don't you hate me? Why do you care?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She choked. The man who was so powerful in Emerald City and feared by so many somehow made her feel that he was throwing tantrums like a naughty child.</p></div>
