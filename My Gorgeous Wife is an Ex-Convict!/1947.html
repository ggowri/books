        <h1>Chapter 1945</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Hadwin Stephenson returned to Stephenson Residence, he saw his long-lost mother in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Wearing elegant clothes and expensive jewelry, she seemed to want everyone to know that she was now the owner of the Stephenson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was neither kind nor mean to him. They were rather partners than mother and son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She gave him life, did not mistreat him in providing for his basic needs, put in a lot of effort to train him, and even tried to protect him when his father's first wife wanted to hurt him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">One could say that his mother had contributed a lot to get him to where he was today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, his mother only saw him as a tool to turn her fate around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not have much affection for his father either. She chose to be a homewrecker to live a luxurious life. Of course, her ambitions did not stop there, so she went to great lengths to conceive him and then raise him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he was a child, his mother often said to him, "You're a child of the Stephenson family, just like the sons of the first wife. You have the blood of the Stephenson family running in you. If you don't inherit the Stephenson family, the first wife's going to kill us. If you don't want to die, you can only keep climbing until your father lets you inherit the Stephenson family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, he kept climbing as he thought that was the whole point of being alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he realized there was something else to life after he met Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps it was what people did sometimes. The more they lacked something, the more they wanted it. He had always lived amidst conspiracies, so Lina's straightforwardness attracted him. He did not have to guess what schemes she was up to or what ideas she had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was so simple yet strangely attractive to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he came back to his senses, he realized that she was the only one he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If... all those things had not happened, perhaps he and Lina would already be together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson asked, "Mom, what are you doing here? You never liked coming here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The first wife used to live here, so his mother did not like it. She bought another house somewhere else and rarely came over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I heard Lina went to your company today and stayed in your office all morning," said Emily Flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes glimmered. It seemed that the person his mother arranged in the company had diligently reported the news to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's true," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why did you let that woman stay in your office? Who knows what kind of gossip will come out of it? Tell the company&rsquo;s security guards to stop her from entering the company," said Emily Flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, this is between her and me. Stay out of it." Hadwin Stephenson rejected his mother's proposal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers seemed displeased. "You're not thinking of being with this woman, are you? Don't forget. You told me she didn't want to be with you when you came back from Emerald City and you won't have anything to do with her anymore! Besides, what's so good about a woman like her? Many socialites in J City are interested in you. You&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's enough. Mom, I know what I'm doing. I never said I want to be with her." Hadwin Stephenson interrupted his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That would be best," said Emily Flowers. She found her son more and more confusing over the years.</p></div>
