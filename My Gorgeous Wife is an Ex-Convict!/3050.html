        <h1>Chapter 3048</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, she'll be fine. She definitely won't have any problems," he said softly, as if he wanted to convince himself with those words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, George rushed over to the Barlow family's place after receiving a call from his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Gregory family has a significant local network. Having them help in finding someone is definitely a good thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For George, he wants to contribute to this matter as a way of repaying Grace and the others for helping Amber before. It could also be to make himself feel better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just Phoebe and Whitney, they disappeared as if out of thin air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe's parents were also sent abroad by her earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, they have lost all leads at this point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two mothers with one child need to hide in a city, which is an easy task.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As time passes by, people are becoming more and more anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The longer the time drags on, the more disadvantageous it is for the hostages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The likelihood of Jasmine getting into trouble is continuously increasing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over the past few days, everyone has not been sleeping well and has been anxiously waiting for news. Especially Grace, who only sleeps for one or two hours a day. Even during this short period of time, she falls asleep and wakes up suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jasmine!" Once again, Grace woke up from a nightmare, and the light that met her eyes told her that it was just a bad dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But that dream felt so real, so real that it scared her immensely!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two arms wrapped around her and pulled her into an embrace. "Don't be afraid, nothing happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So... Jasmine still hasn't been found, right?" Grace murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No news means that Jasmine is still safe, and there won't be no news forever. We have already coordinated with the police and will increase the search efforts. The police will also use advanced technology, so those two women cannot escape! It won't be long before Jasmine is found."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's emotions gradually calmed down. "What about Jasper and the others?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They are fine, just very worried about you and Jasmine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... will go check on them," Grace said, forcing herself to sit up. As a mother, she didn't want her children to feel scared and anxious, even if she herself was feeling the same way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They are already asleep now. You can go check on them when they wake up. For now, you should rest well," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Grace couldn't fall asleep again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, there was a sudden knocking sound on the door. Shortly after, Philip burst into the room and said, "Phoebe called!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as these words were spoken, Jason and Grace were immediately startled. They hurriedly followed Philip to the living room, only to find Valda holding her phone and talking to Phoebe on the other end.</p></div>
