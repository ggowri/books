        <div><span>.</span><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was breathing heavily, her face flushed red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kiss just now was too intense, making her heart beat hard, and all the blood in her body seemed to be rushing to her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does it hurt?" he asked, gently touching her lips with his fingertips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's...fine," she whispered, feeling the spot where he touched her burning even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can we kiss again?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kiss again?" she widened her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't want to?" his eyes became even deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she not want to? Veronica looked at the person in front of her, he was simply irresistible, especially his lips that had just been kissed, they looked soft and red, moist and charming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No...I don't mind." She blushed and took the initiative to kiss his lips again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of kissing him was so beautiful, as if she was slowly picking up the pieces of what she had lost...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because...she really loved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Veronica didn't know how many times she kissed Mason, and even at night, Mason didn't leave, but slept with her in her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for her, it was more warm and comforting than anything else, just like when they were children, holding each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she woke up in the morning and looked at his face, she suddenly felt grateful that she had been willing to "give it a try" with him, grateful that he had given her such an opportunity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, she wouldn't be able to be this close to him now, let alone fall in love with each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the morning at work, Veronica sat at her desk, processing the documents in front of her, when suddenly Daniel's voice sounded next to her, "Veronica, yesterday... I'm sorry, I just worried about you, that's why I said those things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica replied, "I hope this matter can end here, Daniel. I have moved on from what </span><span>happened back then, and I hope you can too. Being stuck in the past will only make yourself more unhappy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's hand hanging by his side couldn't help but clench into a fist, but he still smiled, "You're right, we should move on. By the way, the supervisor just said that Miss Lane's dress has some issues, so let's go and deal with it together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Veronica agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when she and Daniel got into the car, the direction Daniel drove in was not towards the dress shop, but in another direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica immediately felt something was wrong, "Where are you taking me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You'll know when we get there," Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop the car!" Veronica said, "If you're not going to the dress shop, then I want to get off now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've already locked the car door now. If you want to grab the steering wheel, go ahead and try! But then, we might end up crashing!" Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica fell silent because she could tell that Daniel was determined not to stop the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, the only solution might be to secretly call the police or... find Mason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her phone was in her bag, so she could only try to move her hand as little as possible to reach into her bag and take out her phone, then make a call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we really crash, your family will be sad too," Veronica said, trying to distract Daniel's attention, "If you really want to take me somewhere, just tell me directly. There's no need to use this kind of method."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you had listened to me earlier, I wouldn't have done this," Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?" she asked, confused.</span></p></div>
