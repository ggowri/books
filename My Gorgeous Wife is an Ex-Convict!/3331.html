        <h1>Chapter 3329</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The child fell asleep because he had just finished eating. As a newborn baby of only a few days old, he basically eats and sleeps all day long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After the baby was born, his/her eyes haven't opened yet. We don't know when they will open," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After a week or two, the baby should open its eyes," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How do you know? Did you ask the doctor?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, but my mom said I was like that when I was born," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing this, she felt a little relieved. "I wonder who the baby will look like," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since the baby was only a few days old and hadn't opened its eyes yet, it was hard to tell who it resembled more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the baby had a lot of hair and red skin. According to Lisa, the redder the skin of a newborn, the whiter it will be in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I hope she looks like you," Brian said. Although he didn't mind who the baby looked like, he secretly hoped that she would resemble his wife more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought of having a little Valda made him inexplicably excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda suddenly felt like laughing. Both she and her husband hoped that their baby would look like each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't waste your good genes. I want a baby that looks like you. You were so cute in your childhood photos," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda is very envious of her mother-in-law. If she were a mother-in-law herself, she would probably be hugging and kissing her adorable son all the time and not want to let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to Brian's grandmother, he was a cold child and since he was able to understand things, he particularly disliked his grandmother's hugs and kisses. If his grandmother used a "firm" approach to hug and kiss him, he would look very unhappy, making it difficult for his grandmother to continue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Valda thinks that her mother-in-law wasn't persistent enough in her efforts at the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's personality may yield unexpected results if he persists in his pursuit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then you can take a look at my childhood photos, it's the same thing," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was a bit speechless, how could they be the same!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, should we come up with a way to return the red envelope that was given to us by my in-laws? The amount is too big and it makes me nervous. I'm afraid that my bank account might get hacked," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since they gave it to you, it's yours. Why return it?" said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But, such a large sum... I've never had this much money in my entire life, I don't even know what to do," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, after she finished speaking, she was met with his strange gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" She didn't say anything wrong, did she?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You said you've never had this much money in your life?" Brian asked with a smirk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Valda nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know how much you're worth now?" he asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"20 billion?" She hesitated for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"300 billion," he said, spitting out a number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was stunned, staring at Brian, wondering if the number he said was the same as what she thought, or if there was a misunderstanding between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Me - 300 billion?" It took Valda a while to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, we're married, so half of my wealth naturally belongs to you," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But... isn't that premarital property?" she asked.</p></div>
