        <h1>Chapter 3835</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper gave a bitter smile. "Now, I just hope that Daniel was talking nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier at the hospital, she had pretended everything was fine in front of Mason and Veronica. But now, all her disguises had been stripped away, leaving only bitterness and unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shall I take you back to the Reed family first? You need to rest. You haven't been sleeping well lately, and your dark circles have gotten worse," William suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need. I want to go back to school first," Jasper said. Today was the weekend, and there were no classes. But she knew that Lawrence would be in the chemistry lab during this time. There were some things she needed to ask him face-to-face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let me accompany you back to school," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can go by myself. You've been with me all these days, and you must be tired. You should go back and rest," Jasper said, raising her hand to hail a taxi.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next moment, William grabbed her hand. "Are you going to find Lawrence?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper nodded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's too dangerous!" William exclaimed. "If Lawrence wasn't involved in Daniel's plan, then it's fine. But if he was, then he's a dangerous person now. He may hate the Reed family more than you think. If you go to him alone, no one can guarantee that he won't harm you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just going to the school to find him. Even if he really wants to harm me, he won't do it so obviously at school," Jasper said. "Besides, if he really wanted me dead, he had many opportunities before, but he didn't take them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So in Jasper's view, if Lawrence really wanted to retaliate against her, he wouldn't directly harm her. Instead, he would choose to hurt someone she cared about to achieve his goal of revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just because he didn't do it before doesn't mean he won't do it in the future," William said gravely. "Anyway, if you really want to find him, I have to accompany you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them faced off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normally, when William and Jasper have a disagreement, William is always the one who backs down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, William had no intention of backing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Jasper finally said, "Will you come with me back to school? When I find Lawrence, I want to talk to him alone. I'm afraid he won't say certain things if you're standing next to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." This time, William agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William drove and the two of them headed towards the school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the way, he caught a glimpse of Jasper from the corner of his eye. Jasper was looking down, absentmindedly picking at her fingernails.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This habit usually only appeared when she was upset.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they were now boyfriend and girlfriend and closer than before, </span><span>Lawrence was still a taboo topic that Jasper didn't want anyone to touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William couldn't intervene in the matter between Jasper and Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What would happen between Jasper and Lawrence this time?</span></p></div>
