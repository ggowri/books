        <h1>Chapter 3786</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just being objective. Besides," Veronica's voice paused, "Mason is my boyfriend. It's only natural for me to speak up for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he hadn't done such despicable things back then, you would still be my girlfriend!" Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daniel, even though we were together briefly, it wouldn't have lasted. We have too many differences in how we view things and problems. Take care of yourself and the medical expenses and compensation, I believe the Reed family will pay you. I hope this matter can be resolved!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Resolved?" Daniel sneered, "I will appeal and let the public see what kind of person Mason really is!" He wanted to ruin Mason's reputation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really want to appeal, then I will appeal too. You forcibly brought me to the hospital, and my phone was recording our conversation at the time. I think Mason should have a backup recording." Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's face suddenly changed. If there really was a backup recording, then their conversation at the time would become evidence against him, and he would no longer have a valid argument.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I hope this matter ends here," Veronica said, turning around and leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel tightly clutched the blanket covering him, his face contorted in terror. Why did he always have such bad luck? Why wouldn't even Veronica stand by his side?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the victim here!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the misery he was going through was because of Mason and Veronica, and he would make them pay!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the hospital, Veronica took a taxi to the Reed family mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The servants in the mansion knew her, so she was able to enter without any trouble. However, she was surprised to find that Mason had not returned to the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call Mason's phone and ask where he is," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His phone is turned off," Veronica said. She had already tried calling him on the way there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe Mason's phone ran out of battery. Sister Veronica, why don't you wait here for a while? He might come back soon," Jasper suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Veronica felt uneasy. Mason had left the hospital hours before her, and if he was going back to the Reed House, he should have arrived by now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there anywhere else he could have gone?" Veronica asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After Mason went back to his country, he only went to school, home, or to see you, Sister Veronica. There aren't any other places he frequents," Jasper replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Mason was a relatively quiet person and wasn't interested in going out and having fun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica thought for a moment and said, "I'll go back first. If Mason comes back, please call me immediately."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did something happen to Mason?" Jasper guessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There was a bit of a misunderstanding between us, so I want to explain things to him as soon as possible," Veronica explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, if Mason comes back, I'll contact you, Sister Veronica," Jasper replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica left the Reed family, but suddenly didn't know where to find Mason. Should she go to school? Stanford University is so big, and she's not even a student there, so it's hard to find someone on campus.</span></p></div>
