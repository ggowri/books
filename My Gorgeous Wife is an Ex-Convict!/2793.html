        <h1>Chapter 2791</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You may challenge me," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Challenge you? And tell me what?" A voice rang suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller turned around to see Brian, who had arrived at the film set at some point. He was walking toward her, and the actress' expression changed as soon as she saw Brian. Then, she said guiltily, "It's... It's nothing. I was only joking with Miss Theller just now. I have something to do, so I'll leave you alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, the actress hurried away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did this person say something to upset you?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled faintly. "She did say something upsetting, but I didn't let her take advantage of me. After all, I have you as my backup. Not many people in the entertainment industry will actually do anything to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me if anyone gives you any trouble," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated for a moment. "Well, do you really not mind about what happened to me in university? Our relationship is in the open now. I don't want people to gossip about you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were full of worry. Brian's eyes glimmered. 'Is she worried about me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No one will gossip about me, so don't worry," he said before changing the subject. "What do you feel like eating tonight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anything's fine," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, his phone rang suddenly. He frowned slightly as he answered it moments later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no need for that... Yes, I'm dating her, but that doesn't mean I have to bring her back to meet you," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you serious this time, son?" Mr. Hart's disapproving voice came from the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, but now isn't the time yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When will it be, then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll bring her to meet you when I think the time is right," he said and ended the conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who's that..." Valda Theller could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's my father. Let's find somewhere quiet for food," said Brian as he took Valda Theller's hand and walked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller pressed her lips slightly. Though she could only hear the caller's voice, she could make out that his parents wanted to meet her, but he rejected them, saying it was not yet the right time. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Will I meet his family when he has fallen for me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For some reason, she was vaguely disappointed when he said no.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she wanted to meet his parents. It would make her feel like she was getting more involved in his world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The restaurant Brian brought Valda Theller to was a quiet place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he ordered, she habitually played with her phone, but she cried in surprise after seeing a news report.</p></div>
