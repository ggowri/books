        <h1>Chapter 1169</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Hart and Madam Hart nervously looked at the closed operating room doors as they listened to the hospital&rsquo;s specialists describing Brian's injuries and the difficulty of the operation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Hart and Madam Hart felt a little relieved when they learned that their son's injuries were not life-threatening. Then, their eyes fell on Grace and Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">More precisely, they fell on Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must be Grace!" Madam Hart walked up to Grace and said coldly, "I don't care what's going on between you and Brian, but I don't want to see Brian sent to the operating room because of you again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina wanted to defend her best friend, but Grace immediately stopped her best friend and silently shook her head to indicate that she did not have to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had saved her and was sent to the operating room because of it. Madam Hart had already restrained herself by only saying what she did. Even if Madam Hart scolded her harshly, she would have accepted it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, we'll talk after Brian's surgery," Mr. Hart said gravely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Madam Hart then stopped speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two hours later, Brian was wheeled out of the operating room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had two broken ribs, seven stitches on his forehead, and some blood loss, but the operation went well. He would be fine after some recuperation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Hart and Madam Hart's expressions finally looked a little better, and they pushed Brian to the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stood where she was. Lina asked, "Aren't you going to wait in the ward until he wakes up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled wryly. If she could, she would also like to go to the ward and wait until Brian woke up, but... "His parents probably don't want to see me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she was the one who had caused their son to be injured!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Why don't we come and visit Brian tomorrow?" asked Lina. Brian had also saved her life, so she was naturally grateful to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. 'He... should be awake tomorrow. What should I say to him when I see him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt as though there was a weight on her chest!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, the scene of Brian walking up to her with bloodstains on his face and looking at her anxiously as he bent over her to ask if she was hurt recurred to Grace whenever she closed her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She owed Brian so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she had saved him once when she was a child, he had saved her again and again afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could she pay him back?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...Could she never pay it off?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace asked for two days&rsquo; leave from the firm because of the car accident. Early the next morning, she went to the hospital ward first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, instead of Mr. Hart and Madam Hart, she saw her cousin Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, there you are. I heard your and Brian's cars collided yesterday. It scared me to death. Are you okay?" Stella showed a look of concern, but she regretted that the car accident had not killed Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella only knew that two cars collided but did not know that Brian did it to save Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace ignored Stella and walked to the bedside. She looked at Brian, whose body and head was wrapped with gauze. She said, "Thank you... for yesterday." Her voice sounded a little hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had not slept much all night. All she could see last night were scenes of the accident whenever she closed her eyes.</p></div>
