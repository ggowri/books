        <h1>Chapter 2347</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She slapped him hard in the face and interrupted his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop... it, Martin Weiss. Stop it if you ever loved me!" She sobbed as her dark eyes became teary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He froze, his throat feeling like there was something that weighed a thousand pounds stuck inside. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not finish his sentence and just said, "If you don't want any harm to befall him, you'd better stay away from him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, I told you not to bring Chase into whatever is going on between us," said Kyla. She did not want Chase Harper to suffer when he was innocent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss mistakenly thought Chase Harper mattered a lot to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I must bring him into this? By the way, I remember that you were already very close to this Mr. Harto when I found you back then. Were you thinking about getting together with him at the time? After all, he has divorced his wife. What about you? You kept talking about divorcing me after the baby is born. Is it just so you can be with him?" Martin Weiss said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, you&rsquo;ve misunderstood. Kyla and I&mdash;" Chase Harper tried to explain, but he had no idea that his move would backfire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Misunderstood? Is this a misunderstanding?" Martin Weiss's eyes rested on the hand Chase Harper used to hold Kyla. Then, he suddenly reached out and yanked Chase Harper's hand away from Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper staggered and took a few steps backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was eager to check on Chase Harper. However, Martin Weiss yanked her back when she had just taken one step forward in Chase Harper's direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you that worried about him? Are you that anxious to get to him?" Martin Weiss asked sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla tried her best to break away from his hands. "Martin Weiss, let go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was futile. His hand still held her arm firmly. "Kyla, I'm telling you. Even if we get divorced, it doesn't mean you can be with Chase Harper!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla snapped and yelled, "Martin Weiss, what on earth do you want? Since we&rsquo;ve agreed that I'll never appear before you again, what does it matter who I'm with?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, what does it matter?' Her question struck him like lightning, but he just could not stand her being with another man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a nagging voice in his heart that was about to break free! Even if he tried to fight it with reason, it kept shouting the words...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;She can only be with me!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla saw that Martin Weiss had fallen into a moment of trance, so she quickly broke free from his fingers with great effort. She ran over to Chase Harper and asked in a panic, "Chase, are you alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm fine, but should I... I explain to Mr. Weiss..." Chase Harper said apologetically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla knew that any explanation was pointless when Martin Weiss was behaving like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, the high-speed train they were about to take would be arriving soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Chase, why don't we leave first? Let's return to Emerald City," said Kyla. She wanted to leave as soon as possible and not bring Chase Harper into this mess.</p></div>
