        <h1>Chapter 4231 If You Still Can't Love...</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked deeply into Tina's eyes, and after a long time, he finally said, "Alright, I'll do my best to make you fall in love with me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This, for him, is also a kind of hope.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if Tina can't regain her past memories if she can fall in love with him again...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, can you accompany me to see the child tomorrow? Also, I think we should finalize the name for the child," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child still doesn't have a name yet, they usually just call her Sweety for short.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the hospital, they only refer to the little one as "Tina's daughter".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina does care that the child still doesn't have a name, but every time she thinks about giving the child a name, she always thinks of Kit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, she thought Kit was the person she loved, the father of the child, so when she </span><span>thinks about the name of the child, she often incorporates Kit's name as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it seems like a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Chandler agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, tonight, think of some names for the child," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the two returned from the park to the Stephenson family, Lina, and Hadwin joyfully watched as their daughter seemed to slowly accept Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They even made plans to go to the hospital together tomorrow to see their daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina intentionally had Chandler stay for dinner at the Stephenson family before letting him leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, can you tell me what you're thinking?" Lina asked in the evening, entering her daughter's bedroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to fall in love with Chandler again," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Lina furrowed her brow with some unease, "Tina, loving someone is not a matter of 'wanting' or 'not wanting'. If emotions could be controlled so simply, then the world wouldn't have people suffering because of love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, I just think that if I used to fall in love with Chandler, then maybe falling in love with him again isn't so difficult after all. After all, he is indeed a very good man, someone worth loving," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what if you still can't love him in the end?" Lina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I really can't fall in love with him again and can't regain my memories, then I will divorce him," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if she doesn't love him, she can't imagine living with Chandler in the name of husband and wife.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she mentioned "divorce", it startled Lina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to divorce Chandler?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I can't love him, then divorcing would be good for both me and him," Tina said. This way, Chandler can find someone who loves him and whom he loves as well!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina looked at her daughter, at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She naturally understood her daughter's personality and knew that once her daughter made up her mind, she rarely changed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like when her daughter wanted to be with Chandler, even when they hadn't graduated from college yet, she insisted on being together and even wanted to get married as soon as possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it's divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler has loved Tina for so many years, if they really divorce, can he truly accept it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina didn't dare to think further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she could only ask her daughter, "If you divorce Chandler, would you be able to love someone else?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know, I should be able to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you think he can too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Probably." Tina gently lowered her eyes, "After all, in this world, there is no one who truly cannot live without another!"</span></p></div>
