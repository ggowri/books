        <h1>Chapter 2465</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace murmured, "It was upsetting to see Amber Mitchell doing that at Herman Moss's grave today. I wonder how Herman Moss would feel if he knows that the woman he protected with his life is in such a state."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You seem to care more and more about Amber Mitchell," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I probably feel sorry for her after looking up her information and getting the chance to talk to her. Maybe everything would&rsquo;ve been different if Amber Mitchell had loved Herman Moss instead," Grace said emotionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "Maybe. The car accident would&rsquo;ve probably still happened. In that case, Herman Moss's death would only make Amber Mitchell more miserable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly wrapped her hands around Jason. "Jay, it's a good thing you're alright!" She cherished the present more after witnessing what had happened today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She once thought God had given her too many sufferings and was only waiting for the good things to happen after the storm. She only wanted to be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll be okay." He put his arms around her and said, "I&rsquo;ll protect you. I&rsquo;ll protect you and the children. I won&rsquo;t let anything happen to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you must outlive me," she whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes flickered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she seemed to recall something as she murmured, "No, that's bad. If I die before you, you'll be upset and miserable too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had fallen into the sea before this, and he even needed hypnosis to keep himself from breaking down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He buried his head deep in her neck. "If it's time for us to leave when we're old, I want you to go before me so you won't have to suffer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you? What are you going to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll be by your side," he muttered. He would die with her and not let her be alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened as if she understood what he meant. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I love you, Grace. I'll only live for you for the rest of my life. I'm alive if you're alive. If you're gone, I'll go with you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His melodious voice was unusually firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes reddened instantly. Her hands held his face as she gazed at the man who loved her to the core through the tears in her eyes. "Don't you think it's silly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason muttered, "The silliest thing I ever did was almost losing you. Staying by your side is the best decision I&rsquo;ve ever made!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, he gently pulled her hand and kissed her palm with his lips. "Grace, take good care of yourself if you want me to live longer, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." She said nasally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell felt that she had a long dream. In the dream, she had gone back to the moment when she met George Gregory. Due to George Gregory's attentive personality, she finally fell for him and was willing to be with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought that there would never be a man like George Gregory who loved her that much and that George Gregory understood her best!</p></div>
