        <h1>Chapter 605</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had said, "Call me Sis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sis. She considered him family from now on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would always call him, "Jason, Jay..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her calls were like the gentlest of calls, making him addicted to it. He wanted to hear her call him that for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay... Jay..." It was her. She was calling him again... Only why did her cry seem to be accompanied by choked sobs?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she... Crying?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's focus slowly returned to his pupils and he finally saw Grace's tearful face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She&hellip; Was crying?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he hurt her? Yes, he wanted her to prove to him how crazy she was about him, how much she loved him, and how much she wanted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he was desperate to take her in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her face was now covered with tears, her fair skin was covered with bruises, and there seemed to be fear in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he... Frighten her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all because of Brian that he even lost the reason he was so proud of!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you... Afraid of me?" he asked in a mutter, his voice extremely hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's body trembled. Scared? Yes, a little. No matter how she cried and struggled, they all seemed useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even felt that he had become a little unfamiliar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The invisible air about him was like a cold night wind, making her feel pain all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... The way he asked her now somehow made Grace feel as if he was the scared one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He obviously had the absolute advantage over her right now, but she had a feeling that he was like a fragile glass full of cracks. The slightest effort would shatter him to pieces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The atmosphere in the car seemed turbid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two met each other's eyes. Other than the sound of breathing in the car, the rest was just the sound of their heartbeats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tears on her face had not dried. She flusteredly lied in the car seat and said with a choked voice, "It's not you that I'm afraid of, Jay. It's that no matter how I screamed or shouted, you didn&rsquo;t seem to hear me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace spoke. Somehow, he had a feeling that her answer now was going to be so important that perhaps it would easily crush him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why did he feel that way? He was Young Master Reed who was feared by everyone in Emerald City. He could do anything with his power and status and was always the only one who crushed others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it because of the vulnerability he felt right now? She could not help feeling sorry for him and wanted to protect him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Surely she was the one who needed to be protected right now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, Grace went on saying, "Jason, it's not that I don't love you enough that I don't want to do it here, or that my desire for you is not strong enough. It's just that I'm not used to it. If..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused, her body trembling slightly as if she was trying hard to suppress the shyness and fear in her heart.</p></div>
