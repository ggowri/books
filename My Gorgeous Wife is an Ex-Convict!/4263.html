        <h1>Chapter 4261 Proposing a Divorce</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina stood up and quietly looked at Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These past couple of days, she had been trying to calm herself at home and think about what had happened between her and him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even wondered what state of mind she should be in to face him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she hadn't expected to be in such a calm state right now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked a bit worn out, and even seemed a bit lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it just her imagination?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, since she came back, and in those photos and videos from before, he had always been so composed and calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You came at the right time. I have something to tell you,</span><span>" she</span><span> said. Since he was here, she might as well say it now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler trembled as if he already anticipated what she was going to say. After a while, he spoke with a trembling voice, "Okay, go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want a divorce," Tina said bluntly. "This marriage is not what I thought it would be. From the very beginning, it was filled with hidden motives. I don't feel any need to hold it together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler felt his heart sinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had suspected that she might make this decision, hearing it from her was like falling into an endless abyss, unable to climb out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it because of what you heard that night?" he asked with a broken voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's because from the very beginning, our relationship, including your kindness towards me, had a purpose," Tina explained. "So even if you stand in front of me now and say you love me, I don't know if you truly love me or if it's because of the curse that haunts your family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He opened his mouth, seemingly wanting to say something, but in the end, nothing came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I now know that the umbilical cord blood and placenta of the child we would have can save your life, so..." Tina looked at Chandler intensely. "I will have this child, but only through artificial insemination, and after the child is born, custody will be mine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler was taken aback, looking at her with shocked eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You want to have the child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if we divorce, even if I didn't like you from the start because of your hidden motives, I don't actually want to see you die because of a curse. Although the curse seems ridiculous to me, if it's real, then I will have the child. However, I don't want the child to know that the reason for their birth is to save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, in her eyes, the birth of a child should be the result of two people's love, surrounded by anticipation and happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the birth of this child is only to save Chandler's life, completely unrelated to love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She doesn't want the child to grow up thinking that they are merely a tool to save lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's hands fell to his sides, his palms still not healed, pierced again by his nails.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> this is what it feels like to be abandoned by her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had been by his side all this time, and even when she found out about the curse, she didn't abandon him. She even agreed to marry him earlier than planned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it's different!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina now doesn't love him anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this really what you want?" he asked softly.</span></p></div>
