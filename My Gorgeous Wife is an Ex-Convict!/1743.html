        <h1>Chapter 1741</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes were still closed, which meant... he was still under hypnosis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I'm not leaving you. Jay, I'm right beside you..." Grace said with difficulty. Beads of sweat trickled down her forehead, and her face turned pale with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The force of his hand continued to intensify as if he were going to break her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She tried to stifle her moans of pain. "Jay, it's over... It's all over. I'm right beside you now. All... All you have to do is open your eyes and you'll see me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His grip around her fingers was so tight it almost seemed as if he were going to break her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay... I... I'm right beside you. I'll always be right beside you. Just... open your eyes, and you'll see me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before she could finish, he suddenly held his head. His hands pressed so hard against his temples that his fingers almost seemed to sink into his skull.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It hurts... It hurts... My head hurts..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The pain was so intense that he seemed to be in a frenzy, constantly knocking things down in the room and even banging his head against the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No!" yelled Grace. She ran over with all her might and reached out her uninjured hand to block his head. His head instantly hit her palm, and the back of her hand slammed against the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace gasped in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her hand hurt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she knew he was in a lot more pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Dr. Joseph, what happened to Jay? What's going on with him?" Grace asked in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The hypnosis must have stimulated the memories in his head, causing this to happen. It's best to calm him down immediately!" said Dr. Joseph.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">How could they calm him down?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was in so much pain he hit his head against the wall again. Grace continued to let her hand bear the force of the impact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once, twice, thrice... Her hand bore the brunt of the force again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence stumbled to Jason's side and tried to grab his boss but was knocked to the floor again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing that Jason was about to bang his head against the wall again, Grace rushed forward and hugged Jason without a second thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her whole back hit the wall, and the back of her head slammed it hard!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young Madam!" shouted Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I'm fine," Grace said with difficulty. Even though her body was in pain, her hands still held Jason tightly without letting go. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"D-Dr. Joseph, do you have any tranquilizers? If you do... hurry... Hurry and sedate Jay," Grace said with difficulty.</p></div>
