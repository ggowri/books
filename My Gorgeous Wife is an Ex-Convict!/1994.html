        <h1>Chapter 1992</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But... Jasper won't be there,' William thought to himself. Then, he said to Philip Barlow, "Even if you're my daddy, I don't want to go back to Deer City with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow raised his eyebrow slightly. "You don't want to go back to Deer City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I don't want to," he replied with his childish voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why do you want to stay here? As far as I know, many people here call you a criminal's son. You&rsquo;re in an awkward place at the Reed family&rsquo;s house. What's so good about this place? When you get back to Deer City, you'll be the young master of the Barlow family, whom everyone respects. Maybe you're still young and don't know how important the Barlow family is, but you&rsquo;ll definitely regret it if you don't go back with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm not going back," William said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'The young master of the Barlow family&hellip; Is it someone like Mick Reed? The maids dare not say no to Mick Reed and are respectful. They would give Mick Reed whatever he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But... Deer City...' He had no idea how far away Deer City was, but not being in the same city as Jasper made him feel so far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow seemed amused by his son's firm refusal. Speaking of which, it was the first time anyone dared to do so in a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The person who was rejecting him now was his only son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why? I want to know why you don't want to go back to Deer City with me," he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, William pressed his tiny lips tightly together, unwilling to talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Another tiny figure flashed through Philip Barlow's mind and he asked, "Is it because of Jasper Reed?" According to his investigation a few days ago, Jasper was the closest to his son in the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His son had met Jasper in a music exhibition and they got to know each other. Jasper and his son both had great talent in piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's eyes suddenly widened. He was still a child, after all. Even though he was more precocious than his peers, he was not very good at concealing his emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The surprise and alarm in his eyes said it all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow smiled. "Is it really because of Jasper Reed? Are you reluctant to leave that girl? If you like the company of little girls who can play the piano well, I'll get you plenty of them when you get back to Deer City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But none of those playmates are Jasper!' William quietly thought to himself. Then, he met Philip Barlow&rsquo;s eyes again. "No, I want to stay in Emerald City. I don't want to go to Deer City with you. aunt Cummins said I... I can always stay with the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As he was still a child, Grace's promise was the biggest thing he could rely on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow stared at his son, and a look of annoyance flashed through his eyes. "aunt Cummins? Grace? It seems the Reed family has tamed you after having you stay with them for a while! Your mother's dead, so I'm your guardian. Grace is nobody. She's not related to you. I'm taking you back to Deer City, and there's no stopping me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's tiny body instantly tensed like a frightened kitten. He stared at his father without saying a word, but there was a clear sense of resistance all over him.</p></div>
