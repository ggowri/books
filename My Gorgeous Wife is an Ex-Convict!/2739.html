        <h1>Chapter 2737</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... But I want to continue taking care of you." Shana Nicholls bit his lip and said without holding anything back, "Mr. Weiss, actually... I've fallen for you since I started taking care of you. I'm willing to stay and take care of you for the rest of my life. I&rsquo;ll never hurt you, let alone break your heart&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish confessing, Martin Weiss yelled, "Shut up! Who do you think you are? Who are you to say that to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." Shana Nicholls froze. "I just wanted to tell you how much I like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not divorced yet. What do you mean by saying these things?" Martin Weiss snapped, looking at Shana Nicholls with contempt in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls was shocked. 'Not... divorced? But I saw Kyla leave after signing the divorce papers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That means... Martin Weiss hasn&rsquo;t signed them?' Shana Nicholls's eyes seemingly widened in disbelief at the thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said coldly, "I don't want to see you again tomorrow. Now, get out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls staggered out of the study with a pale face. Only a short moment had passed from the time she entered the study and left it, but she seemed to have experienced heaven before falling into hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she had a chance after Kyla left, but reality slapped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could she be willing to accept it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to Kyla's store with her bulging belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't Jason tell you to stay home and not wander around?" Kyla quipped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, but I thought I'd come and see you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled. "Don't worry. I'll be fine. I decided to come back early this time to end things. I won't have any other ideas, and I won't be thinking about it constantly if I cut it off early."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you really let it go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have two children. Why can't I let it go? Love isn't a necessity for everyone. There are things more important to me than love. As for Martin Weiss..." Kyla's eyes dimmed. "He&rsquo;ll live a good life for the rest of his life if he doesn&rsquo;t lift his hypnosis. After all, it's easy for a man like him to find a suitable woman to marry and have children."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sighed, not expecting Kyla and Martin Weiss to come to this after being entangled with each other for so many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, were you going out?" Grace changed the topic as she looked at Kyla's outfit and the bag laid aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was going to the mall to buy some baby formula, but there's no hurry," said Kyla. She could not feed her daughter due to her condition, so she could only feed her with baby formula.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't we go now? My car is here, and I can take you there and back. I want to buy some gifts for Trista anyway." Trista was the name of the baby girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just consider it spending time with me. I don't come out much these days," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled and got into the car with Grace. They drove toward the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bought milk powder in the mall, while Grace bought many baby clothes, toys, diapers, teethers, and the like. The driver carried the things to the car.</p></div>
