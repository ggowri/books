        <h1>Chapter 2442</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said as he held Kyla's hand in one hand and took out his phone in the other to make a phone call. "Get all the media you can contact now. Hurry. I'll give you the specific address in a moment, but be quick..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing the call, Martin Weiss turned to Kyla who was still motionless and said, "Since you intend to make a scene, let's make it a big one!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla only felt a surge of warmth flowing within her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the man would always be there for her and handle everything for her no matter what happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla and Martin Weiss found Grace, the Mitchell family, the Gregory family, and the police were already there. The two parties were locked in a stalemate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had Jason, Brian, and Martin Weiss's men protecting her, but there were still too few people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, there were police officers there. The police warned that they would arrest them right away and sue them later if they did not get out of the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was in the wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back in the Mitchell family&rsquo;s house, Louise Mitchell had found out that Grace, whom she saw at the party before this, was the wife of Emerald City's famous Young master Reed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not only was Jason there but even Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is going on with Amber Mitchell? Why would such big shots want to help her out?&rsquo; Louise Mitchell thought to herself while shouting fiercely, "I'm my sister's guardian. I can tell you that no matter what the evaluation is afterward, it&rsquo;s invalid because you carried it out illegally! I'm going to take my sister away. You&rsquo;ve frightened her, and what you're doing is kidnapping. I&rsquo;ll definitely pursue this matter!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Grace was about to speak when Kyla's voice suddenly rang out. "We didn&rsquo;t kidnap her! We&rsquo;re saving her! I'm saving my friend's life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All eyes immediately fell on the Kyla and Martin Weiss, who had come over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked quickly to Kyla's side. "What are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I started this. Of course, I have to come." She walked up to the police as she said, "I suspect that my friend Amber Mitchell was imprisoned and abused, so I hope the police will allow the doctor to give Amber Mitchell a preliminary evaluation. Barging in now will only interfere with the evaluation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"These are just your words. The police can't wait here just because of your statement. If you really think there&rsquo;s something wrong with the Mitchell family's guardianship, you should go through the normal legal procedures," the police said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have proof!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Proof? Did you need to sneak her out like this if you had proof? You said you're my sister's friend. Why have I never heard my sister mention you?" Louise Mitchell asked.</p></div>
