        <h1>Chapter 3016</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side, William Barlow is currently accompanying Jasper Reed, walking in step with him, almost like a little bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow is not surprised by this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it was this little girl who first showed warmth to William. This is what we call the "nesting instinct."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I just don't know if this fascination with baby birds is temporary or lifelong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it's just temporary, it's easier to handle, but if it's lifelong, then it could be a bit troublesome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a father, he can only provide financial support to his son. Other than that, his son has to work hard on his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today's banquet, Philip came all the way from Deer Capital with his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William made his official debut as the heir of the Barlow family in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When William left Emerald City, he was just an orphan kindly taken in by the Reed family. But now that he's returned, his status is vastly different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jasper saw William today, she got very excited and started talking about her new sister. Then, she suddenly turned to William and said, "By the way, let me take you to see my sister. When Mom and Dad were holding her earlier, you only looked for a moment and probably didn't see her clearly. Let me take you upstairs to see her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William pursed his lips and remained silent for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper was already excitedly pulling the other person's hand and walking towards the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could only follow her footsteps as they went up the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the room, the little baby was lying in the crib while the servant was taking care of him nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper pulled William over to the side of the baby crib and leaned over the railing to look at the little one lying in the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, at the moment, the little one has fallen asleep due to just having finished drinking milk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Isn't she cute?" Jasper exclaimed to William with excitement. "My sister is the cutest! And I've even held her before. I know how to hold her, so when she wakes up, I'll teach you too. You should hold her too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... don't want to," William suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When these words were spoken, Jasper was taken aback for a moment. After all, in her memory, William rarely refused her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you not like my sister?" Jasper asked with his black and white distinct eyes wide open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William bit his lip and shook his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you fear that you won't be able to hold her properly? I can teach you, and you will definitely be able to hold my sister steadily," Jasper patted his chest and said. "Besides, I love my sister the most now. Mommy said that when my sister grows up a little more, I can sleep with her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jasper spoke these words, she only wanted to express her joy, but she didn't notice the sadness in William's expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Does she... like this younger sister the most? And what about him? How much of her liking for him is left?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Will she only sleep with her sister from now on? Even if they are together, she won't sleep with him anymore?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, William felt a variety of emotions and found himself extremely uncomfortable.</p></div>
