        <h1>Chapter 4057</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Um... I guess we've been together for so long that it just feels natural, and we haven't had much physical contact, so..." she trailed off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She did have feelings for him, but she wasn't sure if it was love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But she never thought that the person she would marry wouldn't be him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But if he, as her fianc&eacute;, heard her say these things, he probably wouldn't be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The air was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was so awkward!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina began to wonder if she was too honest. What if Chandler was really angry? What should she do to make it up to him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Would apologizing work?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just as she was racking her brain for something to say to Chandler, his voice rang in her ear again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "So besides having sex, what kind of intimate contact do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Kissing!" She almost blurted out the answer without thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After the words left her mouth, she realized what she had said and looked up at Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Their eyes met directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She felt like she was falling into a deep pool, staring at his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had always known that his eyes were beautiful, and she had always liked them. Her fingers had traced the contours of his eyes many times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But at this moment, his gaze made it impossible for her to tell what he was thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was like a black veil had been draped over his emotions, hiding everything underneath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Um...I was just..." She stumbled over her words, wanting to change the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Do you want to kiss me?" Chandler's thin lips parted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Huh?" Tina blinked her eyes, suddenly brightening up. She nodded eagerly, as if she had been given a second chance at life. "Do you want to kiss me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He didn't seem angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "If you want to, there's nothing stopping us. But are you sure you want to...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Before Chandler could finish his sentence, Tina interrupted him. "Yes, I'm sure!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Okay," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina couldn't help but swallow the saliva that suddenly surged in her mouth. Did he mean that she could kiss him now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," he agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She swallowed hard again, trying to get rid of the lump in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could she really kiss him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it also gave her a surreal feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Close your eyes first," Tina said. After all, it was too oppressive for her to have him staring at her, which made her a little embarrassed to "go down".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler obediently closed his eyes at her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Tina felt a lot of pressure lifted from her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All along, she knew that she really liked Chandler. Even in her adolescence, she had fantasized about what it would feel like to kiss him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However... she could only say that her face wasn't as thick as it is now, so she never really asked him to kiss her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she had asked him earlier, what would his reaction have been?</p></div>
