        <h1>Chapter 3029</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the crowd exchanged words, the middle-aged woman's eyes flashed with a hint of pride. She reached out to try and take Simon away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stepped forward and directly blocked her. "As long as I'm here, you won't be taking him away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Everyone, please reason with him. I just want to take my own child away, but this person won't let me. Is there no justice left in this world? What are you really thinking?" The middle-aged woman clearly wanted the onlookers to help her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some enthusiastic bystanders seemed willing to help, and some even began to scold Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Valda stepped forward and spoke to the middle-aged woman. "We should be asking what you're really thinking. You say you're the child's mother, but your clothes are ordinary and probably not expensive, at most a couple hundred dollars. But the child is wearing all designer clothes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the onlookers listened to Valda's words and noticed the difference in clothing between the woman and the child, they began to react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The middle-aged woman's face changed and she quickly said, "That's because as a mother, I save money and spend it all on buying expensive things for my child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Valda smiled slightly. "You saved up for it? Are you sure you can afford it just by saving up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she pointed to the shoes on Simon's feet and said, "These shoes are a limited edition children's shoe from this brand. There are only 10 pairs in each size, and only super VIP customers of this brand are eligible to purchase them. And the official price of this pair of shoes is 300,000. Do you think you bought them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With these words, there was a commotion around them. Who would have thought that a child's shoes would cost 300,000?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The middle-aged woman's face turned red. "That...that's fake. I bought a pair of imitation shoes that look the same."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh?" Valda continued, "What's your child's name? The child's school bag is right next to you, and there must be homework books or something in it. The child's name should be written on it. If you know the child's name, why not say it? We can open the child's school bag and find his homework book to compare if you're right!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With these words, everyone looked at the middle-aged woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman looked even more embarrassed, and her mouth moved for a while, but she couldn't say the child's name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda shrugged. "It seems you don't know, but I know the child's name. My boyfriend knows the child's name too, and we even know what his parents' names are because we are friends with his mother!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although not really friends! Valda silently added in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With these words, there was a commotion around them, and Simon looked at Valda and Brian in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Are they... Mommy's friends?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he found out that his biological mother was actually the "bad woman" that his grandparents and mother had talked about before, and the person he had always called "mom" was the real villain, he felt like the whole world had collapsed and all his happiness was gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He doesn't know what to do? He also doesn't know who to call mommy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, the middle-aged woman was so angry and embarrassed by Valda's words that she suddenly rushed towards her, intending to hit her.</p></div>
