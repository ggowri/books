        <h1>Chapter 782</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace dragged her suitcases to the nearest bus stop near Reed Residence. She just sat on the bench at the bus stop until her phone rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned for a while before taking out her phone. The caller ID showed that it was Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Lina&hellip;' Grace only found her nose starting to feel faintly sore again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she pressed the answer button, her best friend's familiar voice sounded from within. "Grace, are you at Reed Residence now? Hadwin and I are coming over now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly remembered. 'Oh right. Today's my birthday and I've invited Lina and Hadwin over to celebrate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... there's no need for it now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't need to come over. I... broke up with Jason. There won't be any birthday celebrations today," said Grace. Now, it was as if even saying one word would leave a strong bitterness in her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was immediately stunned. "Broke up? You and Jason broke up? What's going on here? No, where are you now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was anxious. It was too sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Grace's voice&hellip; sounded calm on the phone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this only made Lina even more nervous! She knew her best friend's character, and it would be better if Grace was crying right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This calmness now only meant that Grace was holding back all the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like when she was in prison, Grace kept the pain deep in her heart and never complained or vented it out to her about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It also dimmed the shine in Grace's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was finally starting to recover back to how she used to be little by little. Lina did not want her best friend to go back as she was when she just got out of prison!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, where are you now? Tell me!" Lina said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was silence on the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you don't tell me, I'll ask Hadwin to help me check all the traffic surveillance in the city. I'll even call the police and have them look for you all over the city. Besides that, I'll publish it in the newspapers..." Lina said non-stop. She needed to get her best friend's whereabouts no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She finally let out a long sigh of relief when she finally heard her best friend's voice from the phone. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, wait for me. Don't walk away!" With that, Lina put away her phone and anxiously turned on the navigation system on her phone. Then, she pointed to the destination on the phone's map and said to Hadwin who was in the driver's seat, "Quick. Hurry and drive here. Grace is there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin immediately started the car and drove in the direction indicated by the navigation system.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace broke up with Jason?" he asked. After all, he had overheard part of the conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah." Lina tensed and said worriedly, "I don't know what happened exactly, and it's hard to say over the phone. I can only ask Grace when we see her later. Nothing&hellip; must happen to Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I thought my best friend's misery was over, but what's this? Does God feel that Grace hasn't suffered enough, so he has to do it again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina felt as if her chest was under heavy pressure. She was so scared!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Grace called Kyla on the phone. "Kyla, something happened at the birthday party today. Don't... bring Nelson over. I'll come and see you some other day."</p></div>
