        <h1>Chapter 2742</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. "It doesn't hurt anymore. I'm sorry I made you worried again." She raised her hand and caressed Jason's cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason gently rubbed Grace's palm. "As long as you're okay. As long as you're okay..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that the famous Young master Reed would behave like an insecure child in front of the woman he loved?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was sent into the ward. Perhaps she was tired from the commotion earlier as she soon fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said to Kyla and Valda Theller, "Thank you for today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller waved her hands and said, "It's nothing as long as Grace and the baby are safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "I'm sorry. I caused this to happen to Grace. They were after me, but they frightened Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let me send you back. I'll take care of Grace," said Jason as he sent Kyla and Valda Theller out of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, hurried footsteps grew louder. Brian had arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His handsome face was full of worry, and his hair was slightly untidy from running.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How&rsquo;s Grace?" Brian asked in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised an eyebrow and said, "How Grace's doing is what I as her husband should worry about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Brian frowned as he glared at him. "I asked you how Grace is doing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's... She's okay," Valda Theller said as she hurried forward, not wanting things to get too awkward. "Several people gathered around us while we were eating and it frightened her. It's why her belly ached."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Several people gathered around?" Brian froze and said without thinking much, "Since you were dining together, why didn't you help block the others when they gathered around her? Don't you know she's pregnant? Don't you know she&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough, Brian!" Kyla darted forward. "What happened today is all my fault. It happened because of me. Grace would&rsquo;ve been worse off if it weren't for Valda. You can blame me if you want. Don't blame Valda!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It... It's alright. He's not wrong. If I had paid more attention, Grace might not have been so frightened that she had to be hospitalized," said Valda Theller. However, she felt the urge to cry when she said that. Even her eyes gradually watered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla would like to say more, but Valda Theller interrupted and said, "I... I must go now." With that said, she hurried toward the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla glared at Brian. "Even if you're worried about Grace, you shouldn't blame Valda like this. Since you're her boyfriend, you should know what she's like! Grace kept gripping Valda's wrist when we were on the way to the hospital today. Valda's wrist was scratched until it bled, but she didn't say a word and even said it was okay. Instead of worrying about her, you accused her as soon as you came. Brian, is this how you behave as a boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's accusation shocked Brian, and embarrassment flashed across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The place instantly turned silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason ordered the bodyguards nearby to send Kyla away first before turning to look at Brian. He said, "Valda Theller's a good woman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know." Brian pressed his thin lips together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you don't love her, do you?" said Jason.</p></div>
