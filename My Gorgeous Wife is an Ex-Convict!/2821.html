        <h1>Chapter 2819</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was soaking wet, so he checked into a hotel room near the canyon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The room Brian asked for was the best, of course. It had everything and was elegant yet luxurious. It even had several rooms and two bathrooms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The bathrobe is in the bathroom. Your shoes and clothes will be washed and dried by the housekeeping staff. We should be able to return to tMason Swansonty in the evening," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller replied, "Oh, okay. I'm sorry you got wet when you accompanied me here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "It's not your fault. You don't need to apologize to me at all. Alright, wash up quickly, or you'll catch a cold easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller then entered one of the bathrooms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's hair was wet, and doubt flickered in his cold eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's wrong with me? When I saw Valda Theller almost falling into the stream earlier, I went straight to the water to catch her without thinking.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew that the stream was shallow. She would be fine even if she fell, but his body instinctively reacted differently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does that mean? Am I starting to care about this woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Has the good impression I had of her before become affection?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can I really fall in love with Valda Theller? Can I fall for the woman who suddenly walked into my world? Can my love for her replace my love for Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Falling in love with Valda Theller would be the best outcome for him and everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can I do it?' He was still stuck in the past after all these years. Even though he struggled to get out of the mess, he always failed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can Valda Theller do it?' With a wry smile, Brian walked into the bathroom, turned on the shower, and let the water wash over his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda Theller walked out of the room in a bathrobe after washing up, she saw Brian sitting on the couch. He was wiping his wet hair with a towel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was also wearing a white bathrobe. As soon as he saw Valda Theller come out, he said, "Are you done?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," she replied and approached him, but she suddenly found scratch marks on his arm. However, the cuffs of his bathrobe moved as he wiped his hair, so she could not see clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't move!" she said suddenly as her hand quickly gripped his wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He paused and looked at her quizzically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, she lifted his bathrobe sleeve and saw a bloody scratch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're hurt!" she exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced indifferently at the cut on his arm. "I think I was scratched by the rocks in the stream when I fell just now. It's just a minor injury."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "We&rsquo;d better disinfect the wound and apply some medicine on it. Otherwise, it&rsquo;ll be troublesome if it becomes inflamed. The hotel probably has some emergency medicine. Wait here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she went to the landline and called room service to ask them to send over some medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, she ended the call and let out a breath. She walked back to Brian and said, "It's a good thing that the hotel has the medicine we need. Someone will bring it upstairs later."</p></div>
