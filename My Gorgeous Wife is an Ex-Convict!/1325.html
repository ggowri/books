        <h1>Chapter 1324</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt was stunned but then said, "We're still relatives, after all! Aren't you afraid of people talking behind your back for refusing to help us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The perpetrator isn&rsquo;t even afraid of being gossiped about. Why would I, the victim, be afraid? Besides, Stella didn&rsquo;t consider me her relative when she harmed me." Grace laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt's face turned pale instantly. She immediately tried to lecture Grace by acting as the elder. She raised her hand to poke Grace. However, the bodyguard caught her finger when her hand had just reached out in Grace's direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Third Aunt's finger felt as if it was going to break off and she cried out in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Third Aunt, you'd better not touch me. My bodyguard is no slouch. You're the only one who's gonna get hurt, Third Aunt," Grace said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt was furious, but her finger was hurting so badly that she could only withdraw her hand and glare fiercely at Grace. "Okay, you've grown up, haven't you? Just wait and see. I'll see how arrogant you can be!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you dare do anything to her, I guarantee that not only Stella but your entire family will be put in prison!" Brian suddenly said out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Startled, Third Aunt turned pale and quietly left in disgrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Grace. Moments later, he asked with some difficulty, "Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm doing really well," Grace said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her slightly rosy cheeks and the happiness on her face. She was quite different from before. Like she had said, she was indeed doing really well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his heart was only filled with agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She's doing really well. That also means she made the right choice in choosing Jason, and... the chance of me being with her seems to be getting even slimmer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or rather, my chance was gone the moment she wanted to marry Jason!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you aren't happy with Jason one day, then&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before he could finish, Grace interrupted him, "There will never be such a day. Even if there's any conflict or misunderstanding between us in the future, I'll try to resolve it. Brian, I love Jason, so I'm very blessed and happy to be with him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian instantly shuddered and turned pale. "You... love him?" Every word felt difficult and heavy when he spat them out of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Yes, I love him. Having been through so much, I now know a lot more about myself. I love Jay, and I want to grow old with him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face seemed to lose its color. It was as if her words had extinguished the last bit of hope in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, the past is all in the past. I hope you won't be trapped by it. You've fulfilled your promise to that little girl. She saved you once, and you gave your life to save her. You owe her nothing now!" said Grace. Her melodious voice was unhurried and calm. It was as if she was narrating something calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Owe her nothing...' He smiled bitterly. Then why did his chest feel so heavy when he heard this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said to Huang Qian, the bodyguard next to her, "Let's go." With that, she walked straight to the other side while Brian still stood there, his phoenix eyes following Grace's figure closely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the figure was already out of his sight, he was still looking in the direction she left.</p></div>
