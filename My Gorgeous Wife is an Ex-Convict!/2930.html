        <h1>Chapter 2928</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a cry of alarm from the bodyguard, "Mr. Hart!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller only saw at this moment that Brian Hart and his men had subdued a man wearing only a bath towel, who was still struggling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, are you okay?" Brian Hart stood up and asked with a slight frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine, what about Camille?" Valda Theller rushed inside and saw her friend lying unconscious on the bed. Fortunately, her clothes were still intact, so the man must not have succeeded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille, wake up! Wake up!" Valda Theller shouted and shook her friend, but Camille Strickland remained in a drunken stupor, occasionally making incomprehensible noises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take her to the hospital for a check-up. The woman who brought her here earlier, I don't know what she put in her drink," Brian Hart said as he walked over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart's two men came over, one of them supporting Camille Strickland, while the other said to Brian Hart, "Mr. Hart, you were stabbed by that man's knife just now. You need to go to the hospital to treat the wound. If there is too much bleeding..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? You're injured?" Valda Theller was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only now that she noticed that Brian Hart's face was paler than before, and there were large drops of sweat on his forehead. His hand was pressed against his waist, and because he was wearing black clothes today, the color of the blood was not visible on his clothes, but... blood was slowly seeping from between his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's okay, it's not a deep wound," Brian Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was so anxious that tears streamed down her face. "Quick, let's go to the hospital! Otherwise, the bleeding will get worse!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Outside the hotel, the police had arrived. When they saw that Brian Hart was injured, they immediately sent a police car to clear the way and escort him to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, Valda Theller looked at Brian Hart with tears in her eyes. "Does it hurt... it's all my fault. If I hadn't rushed in so recklessly, you wouldn't have been stabbed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he didn't say how he was injured, she wasn't stupid and could guess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she knocked on the door at the beginning and rushed in after it opened, the man who was caught should have been holding a knife and trying to stab her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But he had blocked the knife for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... he didn't say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it weren't for his men reminding her, she wouldn't have even noticed that he was injured! Why was she so careless! Valda Theller regretted it so much at this moment!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you don't cry," he struggled to lift his other hand to wipe away her tears, "it seems that every time we meet, you're crying... and today you made you cry again..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's my fault, I caused you to be injured. If only that knife had stabbed me instead!" she choked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Blocking that knife for you was my own choice. If that knife had really stabbed you, then... wouldn't I have been useless?" Brian Hart murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, last time, I was too impulsive. I know you didn't lie to me. I was blinded by jealousy and thought you really had something with Raymond Bowman. Can you forgive me?" He looked at her, begging in his phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if her forgiveness was of utmost importance to him.</p></div>
