        <h1>Chapter 361</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long while, she heard him sigh. Then, he straightened his back. His mesmerizing eyes looked at her helplessly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only her. She was the only one he longed to have. Just her. She was the only one who could make him helpless after being rejected. It was as if he was becoming less and less like himself in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Help me dry my hair,&rdquo; he said. Then, he handed the towel that he planned to dry his wet hair with to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him in shock as he lowered his head before her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Didn&rsquo;t you always dry my hair for me when we were in the rented house?&rdquo; he asked while lifting his eyebrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Things were way different back then! Grace pressed her lips together. Eventually, she started drying his hair for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since the towel covered his face, it made her slightly more relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was like an obedient puppy that was allowing her to dry his hair. At this moment, Grace had a weird feeling. It was as if she was his ruler and he was bowing down to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not control the laughter in her heart. Gosh, why did she have this thought? She might just be an ant in front of Jason. She would not be able to fight back if he decided to crush her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did she only have this illusion because he was being docile and tame?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long while, she removed the towel after she felt that it was almost done. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, his hair was messy. His bangs were covering his forehead and half of his eyes. Grace felt like she was seeing Jason from back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those black eyes hid behind his bangs and were staring at her intensely. It was as if he was trying to absorb everyone&rsquo;s soul undetected. One would want to take a look at his true face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but reach out her hand to push away his bangs so that she could see the eyes behind his bangs clearer. They were cold, flirtatious, and there was also a hint of unforgettable pureness and beauty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, there was a rare gentleness in the eyes that were staring at her. It was as if she was the most important person to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quivered and came back to her senses. When she was about to retract her hand, Jason grabbed it and placed her hand on his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Do you not like my face? Didn&rsquo;t you say that I look very handsome and you won&rsquo;t be able to get sick of looking at me every day?&rdquo; he said in a low voice. His voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing against her hand with his face. It was as if he was yearning for her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wanted so badly to take back what she said before. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was red. She turned her head away to stop looking at him. She would feel more uneasy if she kept looking at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her gaze landed on a bowl that was on his desk. To be exact, the bowl was already empty. However, she could still see the black and brown residue in the bowl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You took Chinese medicine?&rdquo; Grace asked subconsciously and looked at Jason weirdly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he replied briefly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Are you sick?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to nurse my stomach. Didn&rsquo;t you say I have to nurse myself back to health, Sis? I listened to what you said,&rdquo; he replied with a smile on his face. He looked like he was asking for praises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know what to do. Should she pat him on his head to praise him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Um&hellip; That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; she said that after pondering for a long while.</p></div>
