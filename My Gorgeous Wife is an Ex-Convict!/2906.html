        <h1>Chapter 2904</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I like you, truly and deeply. I am unsure when this liking will transform into love, but I believe that with you, it is possible!" A refined voice echoed in the room. "Valda Theller, are you really going to give up on me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In that moment, Valda Theller felt a lump in her throat and found herself unable to utter a denial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even after Brian Hart had left, Valda Theller still had not given an answer. She sipped on her ginger and brown sugar tea, drinking it slowly until it was all gone. The pain in her abdomen seemed to lessen with each sip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller knew that when Brian Hart had spoken those words to her earlier, she had been shaken. After all, he was the first person she had ever loved so deeply, a love that was far stronger than her previous infatuation with Raymond Bowman. How could she not be shaken when the person she loved expressed their fondness for her and asked if she was really going to give up on him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she recalled the words Brian Hart had spoken to Jason Reed outside of Grace's operating room at the hospital, she suppressed her doubts once again. She did not want to end up in an undignified breakup with Brian Hart in the future because of Grace. It was better to maintain their mutual respect and good feelings for each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller placed the empty cup on the coffee table and lowered her head, looking at her abdomen. Today, when she found out that she had gotten her period and was not pregnant, she felt a sense of relief but also a hidden sense of disappointment. Perhaps it was because she had already mentally prepared herself for the possibility of having a child with Brian Hart. If the child had been born, she would have tried her best to be a good mother and give all her love to the child, so that they could grow up healthy and happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now, without a child, it meant that she and Brian Hart could never have one together. The chances of conceiving were already slim, and she had never been lucky enough to win the lottery.</p></div>
