        <h1>Chapter 1302</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, Jason's eyes turned red. Was he too nervous, or was he so looking forward to it that his body even started trembling slightly? His lips were quivering too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You love me... Really?" he murmured with a shaky voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Yes. Could it be fake? Jay, I love you. I thought it might take a long time for me to love you again, but... love doesn't seem to be affected by time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no earth-shattering incident nor any special opportunity. She just naturally confirmed her feelings for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was probably because she loved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason suddenly held Grace in his arms again. "You said you love me. You can't go back on it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I won't go back on my word," she said, hearing the lump in his voice. "Jay, are you crying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not answer her but buried his face deeper into her shoulder, taking in her scent as if to imprint everything about her into his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only feel the wetness on her shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace and Jason slowly walked out of the cemetery, Terrence, who was waiting outside, was surprised when he saw his boss with red eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Grace seemed to be in good spirits with a faint smile on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow, Terrence thought that the scene should be of a man bullying a little lady so her eyes reddened with tears of grievance while the man was jolly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the scene before him seemed to be the other way round!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Well... Was Boss bullied? Was he bullied until his eyes were red with tears?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Tears?' Terrence was startled by the passing thought and reassured himself that it was absolutely impossible! 'How could Master Reed possibly cry? His eyes are probably red because the wind blew sand into his eyes earlier.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence thought, but the next moment, what Grace said shattered it completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright. Look at you, I wouldn't have said that if I knew you were going to cry. Your eyes are a little swollen now," said Grace as she looked at Jason's eyes carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his eyes that were swollen from crying were still so beautiful. Above all, the wetness in his eyes after crying even made people feel sorry for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Jason would not know whether to laugh or cry if he knew what was on Grace's mind right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence was petrified!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Master Reed really... cried?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Well... What did Young Madam say that made Master Reed cry?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have to tell me even if my eyes are swollen. You can't keep it to yourself!" said Jason. Did she know how much it meant to him when she said she loved him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, okay!" she said. She seemed to be pacifying a child, raising her hand to pet his head as if she were petting a puppy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence stayed petrified!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Young Madam could do something like that to Master Reed. If it were someone else, their hand would have been chopped off!</p></div>
