        <h1>Chapter 1108</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe I can try," Brian said without flinching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two high and mighty men, both who dominated Emerald City, were now confronting each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If Grace doesn't want to stay here, then I'll take her away no matter what!" said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll break your other hand too," Jason said coldly, immediately attacking Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian saw it coming and dodged. The two men began to fight back and forth, but Brian could not strike because of his injured right hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason had pinned Brian down and grabbed his uninjured left hand. Just as he was going to break it, Grace suddenly rushed forward and grabbed Jason's hand tightly. "No! Don't hurt Brian again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's expression immediately turned incredibly pale. "What if I insist on breaking his hand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it nothing to you to break a man's hand?" asked Grace. Lily and Sean had also talked lightly about incapacitating her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had made the decision so lightly, but it had cost her dearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you defending him?" snapped Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Grace answered affirmatively. Brian had already broken his right hand because of her, and she did not want Brian's left hand to suffer the same fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to owe Brian anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes stared at Grace. "Do you care about him that much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent. It seemed wrong to say that she did not care at all. After all, Brian was... the Bryn from her childhood. He was the partner who had faced danger with her and the friend who had promised to meet her again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was the one who broke the promise and did not &lsquo;meet&rsquo; Brian again. She even gave him a misconception!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had also saved her from falling off a cliff when she met him on the day she was visiting her grandmother's grave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Unfortunately, no matter how much you care about him, you can't protect him!" Jason said fiercely, tearing Grace's hand away before pinning Brian to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stepped one foot on Brian's injured right hand while his hand grabbed Brian's left hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A sharp pain immediately spread from the wound once he stepped on the hand that had not healed yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian immediately turned pale, and a thin layer of sweat broke out on his forehead. Even so, he moved his thin lips at Grace. "It doesn't matter. It's just another broken hand. Don't worry. I said... I&rsquo;d take you out of here, and I will! If I'm not out in half an hour, someone will naturally come looking for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason has a plan, but I have one too!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at Brian who was in pain. She recalled how the little boy, who stayed with her in the forest for a day and night, had said, "I'll come looking for you. Next time, I'll protect you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait for me. You must wait till I find you!"</p></div>
