        <h1>Chapter 4037</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If her current physical condition didn't prevent it, he really couldn't resist!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Mick stood up and left Nancy with a sentence, "I'm going to the bathroom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned for a moment, then seemed to understand something and her face turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, Nancy slept on Mick's big bed, while Mick set up a small bed in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We can sleep on the same bed," Nancy said strangely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's probably better if we sleep separately, otherwise I'm afraid I won't be able to resist," Mick said uncomfortably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy blinked and immediately understood. "Um...if you really can't resist, I can help you," she said, blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she was still in postpartum recovery and couldn't have sex, there were still some things they could do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, you just rest," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't you want me to help you?" She leaned closer to him, her sweet scent driving him crazy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not that, I just don't want you to get too tired," he reluctantly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had always been proud of his self-control, but in front of her, it was fragile and easily broken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I want to," Nancy said. "I want to touch you and be closer to you. Besides, don't think of me as too delicate. It won't tire me out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..." He still hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mick, it's not just you who has desires. I can't resist either," Nancy said. "So, can we sleep together? I want to fall asleep with you holding me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her and hoarsely said, "Okay..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a night of intimacy, Nancy fell asleep contentedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Mick looked at his sleeping wife and couldn't help but smile bitterly. It seemed that even this wasn't enough to satisfy him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His desire for her was far greater than she imagined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as long as she was okay, nothing else mattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she also has this need and desire for him, then he can suppress his impulses and try to satisfy her as much as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, I love you, and you will always love me... okay?" His low voice echoed in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In response, there was only the sound of her peaceful breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A smile unconsciously appeared on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy stayed at the Reed House, and aside from being a little unaccustomed to the Reed family's lifestyle and the servants' service, everything else went well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were no conflicts between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law or between sisters-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was eager to take care of Nancy. If Nancy felt uncomfortable in any way, Jasper was the first to get anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy had a good impression of her mother-in-law, Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Grace was a highly successful lawyer and the head of the Reed family outside, she had a kind of inexplicable closeness to Nancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it was because of their similar experiences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, in some ways, this mother-in-law was the one who could best understand Nancy's feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace also took care of Nancy very well, not being overbearing, and even consulting with Nancy on some matters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially with regards to the wedding, she respected Nancy's opinions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Like a kind elder, she listened to Nancy's thoughts and gave appropriate advice. This way of getting along made Nancy feel very comfortable.</p></div>
