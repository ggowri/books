        <h1>Chapter 1387</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Paisley Daniels wanted was to probably let Martin Weiss see this scene. She wanted Martin Weiss to think that she was guilty of hurting Paisley Daniels again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why? Why would Paisley Daniels go so far to do this? I've retreated again and again, but it turns out that the human heart can be so malicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even though Paisley Daniels is about to marry Martin Weiss, she still wanted to set me up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, I'm only someone whom Martin Weiss hates to death. Why set me up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she afraid of Martin Weiss falling in love with me again?' Kyla Corbyn suddenly felt like laughing. She raised one hand to remove the hearing aid her son was wearing in his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want Nelson to hear what they would say next because it would be too cruel for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want the adults' feud to plant a shadow of hatred in the child's heart. She did not want her son to live in hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only hoped Nelson could have a happy future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was stunned. He looked up at Kyla Corbyn in confusion, wondering why his mother had suddenly removed his hearing aid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Paisley Daniels, don't you think you're too much? You framed me back then because you were afraid that Martin Weiss had feelings for me. That was a valid reason. But now, even if I die in front of Martin Weiss, he'll only think that I'm tainting his eyes. Why do you still want to frame me? Or is that all to your relationship with Martin Weiss that you need to be paranoid and scheme all the time?" Kyla Corbyn said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels hated it and wished she could tear off Kyla Corbyn's mouth, but she had to continue to pretend to be &lsquo;weak&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, her body was indeed aching terribly all over. After all, the things that had just fallen off the table were real.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nearby Mrs. Daniels scolded Kyla Corbyn, "You vicious woman! You're just jealous of Paisley. You deliberately pushed her to hurt her. Luckily, I thought the tea here was too hot and had someone change it to cold tea. If it were hot tea, Paisley's face would've been ruined! Kyla Corbyn, you're really ruthless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Daniels also scolded, "Kyla Corbyn, what has the Daniels family done to you for you to harm Paisley like this? Paisley is already willing to treat your son as her own, but what did you do instead? You end up doing such ruthless acts once things don't go your way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you do this to Paisley?" Martin Weiss snapped as he walked over and grabbed Kyla Corbyn's arm. "Why did you do that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you believe me if I said she set me up?" Kyla Corbyn asked lightly. She did not seem to care about Martin Weiss's anger right now. However, she pulled her son into her arms with her other hand and pressed his little head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want Nelson to see such an ugly scene!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson seemed to be a little scared. He trembled as his little hands clutched both sides of Kyla Corbyn's dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why would Paisley frame you? What would you have to do to deserve her framing you?" Martin Weiss said angrily. He found it irritating when he thought of what she had said when he entered the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been the one who told her not to die in front of him and taint his eyes, but he was somehow annoyed when the words came out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have to ask Paisley that. I also wonder why she wants to set me up?" Kyla Corbyn instantly pulled her hand away from his fingers with almost all her strength.</p></div>
