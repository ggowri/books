His wife was </span><span>always a big mouth and had the closest relationship with Grace. Therefore, thanks to his wife, everyone knew about Lawrence being found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, it's quite surprising. He was actually adopted by the Elliott family," Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Which Elliott family?" Brian asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not in the country, but overseas. They made their fortune in shipping," Jason replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh?" Hadwin pondered thoughtfully. The Stephenson family was the leader in shipping in the country. If it was about shipping, the Stephenson family would naturally know more than others. "Could it be the Elliott family from Yemen?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There are many </span><span>wealthy families </span><span>in Yemen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's that Elliott family," Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He was adopted by that family?" Hadwin asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To be precise, he replaced the original heir of the Elliott family who had passed away," Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadwin frowned. "That Mrs. Elliott from the Elliott family seems to have some mental problems."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The information I found says she's already better," Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sometimes only the parties involved know whether it's really better or not," Hadwin said lightly. "But Lawrence has been found. Jasper should be happy. It's also considered fulfilling one of her wishes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe finding him is just the beginning of trouble," Jason said. "Lawrence now is not the same simple kid as before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you scared?" Brian asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not really, but I'm worried he might do something stupid and hurt Jasper," Jason said. In fact, he didn't really care about how Lawrence was doing. He only cared about his daughter. "Speaking of which, Jasper gave him an invitation to her birthday banquet today. He should come. You can take a look at him then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone present was aware of Lawrence's situation, as all the families had helped in the search for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, the women were chatting about William and Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is Jasper really dating William?" Lina, the most gossip-prone, started the topic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Grace replied with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's like a childhood crush that turned into reality," Lina sighed. "I've thought they had something going on since they were kids, like a fairy tale. I wish I had a childhood sweetheart like that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't, but your daughter does," Grace teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, yeah, now that you mention it, Tina and Chandler are childhood sweethearts too. But who knows if it will turn into love in the future," Lina said, as her daughter was only 13 and still in the innocent stage of love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was engaged to Chandler since birth, and no one knew what the future held for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler had developed feelings for Lina's daughter, but Tina...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina worried about what would happen if Tina didn't love Chandler in the future. The thought of how the Stephenson family and the Hunter family would handle it gave her </span><span>a headache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are other childhood sweethearts too," Kyla said. "Harley and Lornell are also close. Maybe they'll end up like William and Jasper."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valda smiled. "They do get along well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, are Lornell and Chandler coming over today?" Amber asked.</span></p></div>
