        <h1>Chapter 3870</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But isn't that the same as cohabiting?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He asked back, "Don't you want to?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Well... Veronica thought about it. After all, they had lived together for over a decade before, and she had been living with the Reed family during this time. She didn't feel uncomfortable being under the same roof as him, but...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do your family members know that you're going to live here?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Mason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And what was their reaction?" She didn't want them to think that she had kidnapped their son, brother, and brother-in-law!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why would they have any reaction?" Mason asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica rubbed her forehead, "Well, since they are now boyfriend and girlfriend and have a good relationship, it's normal for them to live together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although her small apartment has two rooms, Mason still put all his things in her room. In short, he planned to share a room with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica had no objections to this. After all, they had been sleeping on the same bed for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, they would get married sooner or later, so what difference did it make if they slept together a day earlier or later?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, after six months, Veronica found out that there was a difference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That day, she and Shirley had just finished class and went to a restaurant near the school to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although her popularity had already declined, many people in the school still knew that she was dating the second son of the Reed family. Therefore, there was naturally more attention on her when she walked around the campus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some people tried to please her, while others made sarcastic remarks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica tried to ignore all of this as much as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finally finding an empty seat, they sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, not long after they sat down, several people walked over. When they saw Veronica and Shirley sitting in the seats, their faces changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of the girls came over and asked in a bad tone, "Why did you take our seats?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was stunned, "What do you mean by taking your seats? When we came, the seats were empty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I left something there. You should know that this seat is mine!" the girl said unhappily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The table where Veronica was eating was a six-person table. When she and Shirley came over, they saw a book on the table in front of one of the chairs. In school, this usually means that the seat is taken, so they didn't sit in that chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We didn't take the chair you were occupying," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're being unreasonable. I'm occupying the whole table! I've even put my books on it. What's the point of you sitting down?" the other person said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica frowned. "A book taking up the whole table, especially during peak dining hours, is a bit unreasonable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's unreasonable about it? We have a big group, so we need the whole table!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Veronica looked and saw that only three girls holding trays had come up to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are only three of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are more people coming. They'll be here soon. Anyway, you'd better switch tables now and not eat here!" the other person said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, who do you think you are?" Shirley said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's your fault. You knew someone was already sitting here, but you still sat down to eat!" the other person accused.</p></div>
