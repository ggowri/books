        <h1>Chapter 93</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ever since she was a child, in order to earn the praise of her father and make her step-mother not hate her, Grace had tried hard to cater to everyone. To please everyone. Although she had won a lot of honors, she lived a tiring life.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean had taught her that there was no one she could rely on.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However... Jay had said that he wanted to be her support. A smile surfaced on Grace&rsquo;s face when she thought of Jay. After she was released from prison, perhaps the luckiest thing that had happened to her was meeting him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she thought about it, she scrolled through the web page. Suddenly, there was a post reporting the scene at the front of the hotel. Jason Reed, the head of Reed Group, had also come to attend the engagement ceremony. However, Jason was surrounded by bodyguards and had not allowed anyone to take a photo of him. Even the reporters were not able to take a photo.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Anyone who filmed it would be made to delete all of the content on the spot.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although Mr. Reed was too domineering, he had the capital to behave in such a way.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, the person who had posted this said that he had risked his life to capture the back of Jason. Jason had always refused to take interviews from the reporters, and even though there would be reporters wherever he went, it could be said that he was very mysterious to the public.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even for Grace, who had been accused of murdering Jason's fianc&eacute;e, Jennifer Atkinson, she had never seen Jason Reed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In court that year, Jason had never attended from the beginning to the end. Not once.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina once said that she ran to the Reed Group and attempted to meet with Mr. Reed. She&rsquo;d hoped Jason Reed would understand that Jennifer Atkinson's death was caused by something else. That Grace had never been drinking nor had she set out to harm that woman.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, she had been directly thrown out without even getting to see Mr. Reed&rsquo;s face.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sometimes Grace found it a little funny. She and Jason had never met before, but it was as if her life was closely tied to this person. While she had been imprisoned, no one in the city had dared to help her with the lawsuit, and the torment she endured in the prison seemed to have had some relation to Jason Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was drawn to the bottom of a post and saw the photo. Surrounded by a group of bodyguards, the figure was still very eye-catching.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wide shoulders, trim waist, long legs.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">With such proportions, he could almost be compared to a model.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Among Grace's acquaintances, only Jay had such proportions.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jay... The figure flashed through Grace's mind. She seemed to feel that Jay's back was actually very much similar to that of Jason Reed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"God, what am I thinking!" Grace shook her head. They were two completely different people, and Jay never wore formal suits.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, if Jay were to wear a suit, he would definitely look good. Staring at the picture of the figure, Grace could not help but fall into deep thought...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason Reed attended the wedding of the Stevens and Atkinson families, she imagined that this pleased Sean very much. Both families likely were very relieved to have the proverbial &lsquo;blessing&rsquo; of the king of the city.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">***</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Your <span style="font-style: italic;">Highness</span>, can I have a word?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason snorted and ignored his friend.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He kept himself to a corner of the room, and while countless business executives and associates had attempted to make their way to his table, Terrence was stationed several feet in front of him and elbow-to-elbow with several bodyguards, ensuring that no one made it through.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Brian, how did you even get over here?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian chuckled.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It was nice of you to show,&rdquo; Brian said. &ldquo;You must know that the Stevens and Atkinsons were sweating it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason shrugged.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;And look at this line of people wanting to strike up a business relationship with you. Come now, why don&rsquo;t you brighten some lucky fool&rsquo;s future.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason smirked sardonically.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too lazy to deal with these people,&rdquo; Jason said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Your man, Terrence, seems to be doing a good job.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason&rsquo;s lips twitched again. Poor Terrence. He really needed to give the man a raise.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I heard that you seem to be very busy recently. It's very difficult for others to even ask you out." Brian said more quietly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason looked more closely at Brian then. Brian might appear detached and cold, but there were many women who loved this man like crazy. "What about you? I heard that you seem to have changed your ways recently?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mm. Yes," Brian Hart said faintly. It was as if this was an ordinary matter for him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Patrick even made a bet with someone saying that your ex can end your single life," Jason said.</p></div>
