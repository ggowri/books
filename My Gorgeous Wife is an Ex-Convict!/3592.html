        <h1>Chapter 3590</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the photo, the distance between the two faces is extremely close, and Roger's hand is even around her waist, making them look very intimate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Last time, when your photo with Roger was taken and posted, you said it was a mistake. This time, it can't be a mistake again, right?" Horea said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other two also nodded in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper frowned and looked at the post. It was anonymously posted by someone else. In addition to the photo, the photographer also stated that they accidentally took it. Although they couldn't hear what the two were saying due to the distance, from their expressions and body language, it was clear that they had a close relationship. When the girl was hugged by the boy, her expression was shy and timid, indicating that she really liked him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These words left Jasper speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Come on, she's not shy or coy at all! And to think that she obviously likes boys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was just meeting with Roger today to discuss some things, it's not like what the post said," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then why was Roger holding onto your waist?" Meave asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That was just an accident," Jasper said, "Anyway, there's really nothing going on between us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh..." the three roommates responded in unison, but their expressions were completely different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Jasper's phone rang. She picked it up and saw that it was a call from William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where are you now?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm in the dorm room," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm downstairs in your dorm room now. Can you come down?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Jasper was surprised, then quickly walked to the window and looked down. He saw a familiar figure standing below the dormitory building, looking up at the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, their eyes met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper felt his heart skip a beat and instinctively pulled his head back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other people in the dormitory noticed and looked out the window. After a moment, they said, "Mr. Barlow is here to see you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you really have nothing going on with Roger, then just go talk to Mr. Barlow and clear things up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, otherwise he probably won't be able to sleep well tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ignoring her roommates, Jasper hurriedly ran down the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she left the dormitory building, she saw many people coming in and out of the dormitory, their eyes glancing towards William. And when she walked up to him, even more eyes turned towards them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you doing here?" she asked, slightly embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going back to Deer Capital tomorrow. My grandfather is sick and in the hospital, I have to go see him," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Jasper was surprised. "How is your grandfather? Is it serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper has always had a good impression of Grandpa Barlow and likes this kind old man very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she used to go to Deer Capital, she mostly stayed with the Barlow family, and Grandpa Barlow was very fond of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's nothing major, he's just getting old and prone to illness, so he needs to stay in the hospital for a few days," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I'll go to Deer Capital with you," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I'll go alone. You can convey your concern to Grandpa Barlow," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to go!" Jasper insisted. "I want to see Grandpa Barlow. Besides, tomorrow is Saturday. I'll stay in Deer Capital over the weekend and come back on Monday. It won't affect my studies."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William nodded and said, "Okay, then I'll book another flight ticket. The flight is at 9 o'clock tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Great," Jasper replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, you should go back now and rest well tonight," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was taken aback and blinked his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is that it?!</p></div>
