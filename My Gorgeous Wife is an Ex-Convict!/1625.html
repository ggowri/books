        <h1>Chapter 1623</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All of a sudden, he sneered. "Because you have someone else now. Is it Anthony Sherman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he uttered the name, Lina's expression changed immediately. She had only mentioned Anthony Sherman's first name during the phone call earlier, not his last name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Hadwin Stephenson knew his full name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Which also meant... "You looked into him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So what if I did? What about you? How much do you love him? Is it like what you used to feel for me?" he asked with restrained struggle and jealousy in his tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's none of your business," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His face seemed to darken under the light of the lamp above them. "You're my ex-girlfriend, after all. Can't I be concerned about you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You just said I'm your ex-girlfriend. Mr. Stephenson, if you want to be concerned about someone, why don't you pay more attention to your current girlfriend?" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was silent for a moment, then suddenly said, "Have you ever hated me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was stunned for a moment. She stared at him in bewilderment, wondering why he suddenly asked such a question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Have you ever hated me? Have you hated that I abandoned you when you were at your lowest and chose to break up with you and be with another woman?" Step by step, he moved toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She backed away almost instinctively, but with each step she took, he took one step closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was until her back was against the wall and there was no room for her to retreat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His hands were pressed against the wall on both sides of her body. They were very close, and his breath sprayed on her face. However, they were not really touching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Did you hate me?" His voice continued to murmur, "Did you hate me for holding another woman when you were in pain? Did you hate me for enjoying a rich and glorious life when you were struggling? Did you hate me for all the promises I made to you that never came true?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He spoke word by word as if pressing for an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina stared blankly at the face in front of her. The man still had egg in his hair that he had shielded her from.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Otherwise, all of it would be on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, none of these affected his beauty. Five years had made his delicate face a little more masculine, mature, and reserved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She stared into his beautiful eyes but could not make sense of the depth in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said slowly, "I don't hate you. Hadwin Stephenson, you're someone I once loved. It's not like you weren't suffering when I was at my worst. You were under siege back then. If you had chosen me, then maybe you would&rsquo;ve lost the Stephenson family. You would&rsquo;ve become an ordinary person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Shock flashed through his eyes as though he had not expected her to say so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You don't... hate me?" he murmured. The four words almost seemed to have been squeezed out of his throat with a tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She said, "I don't hate you, and I don't want to hate you. Hate is a very hurtful feeling. It was nice being in love with you. I don't want to add hatred to it. Between love and career, you chose the latter. That&rsquo;s all you did.&rdquo;</p></div>
