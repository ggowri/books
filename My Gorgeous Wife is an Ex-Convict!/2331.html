        <h1>Chapter 2329</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't have anyone I love... at the moment. I just want to raise my two children in peace," she whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "It would be best if that's true. I don't want my children to call another man &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo;."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stepped back after saying that. Then, he stuffed the phone he was holding back into her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, instead of spending time with Chase Harper, why don't you figure out how to get me to agree to your request? After all, you came to Emerald City to ask me for help, didn't you?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her red lip and glared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Martin Weiss left the room, Kyla seemed to go weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know why Martin Weiss suddenly burst into her room and spoke to her like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he come here to throw a tantrum because he was jealous after seeing her and Chase together?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It might have been possible if it were before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, had he not lost his feelings for her? He should not be jealous, then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, his last words seemed to be encouraging her to beg him more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, after Martin Weiss returned to Weiss Residence, Mrs. Weiss stepped forward and said, "You're back. Why are you so late today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I had some social engagements," Martin Weiss replied indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's a banquet in a couple of days, and I'd like you to accompany me," said Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss raised his hand and rubbed his brows. He knew that many socialites in tMason Swansonty would probably be attending the banquet his mother mentioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since his return to L City, his mother had started introducing him to some of tMason Swansonty's socialites. However, he was not interested in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't forget, Mom. I'm married. It's inappropriate for me to attend these things," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can get a divorce at any time. You only married for the sake of the children. I think Kyla won't refuse if you ask for a divorce. We can give her more compensation," said Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "But I'm not interested in meeting and dating another woman while the marriage is still valid. Mom, it's fine if you only want me to go to a party with you, but I don't want you to set me up with anyone right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Mrs. Weiss's expression changed. "Are you still thinking about Kyla? I heard that woman came here from Emerald City and would wait outside your office every day. She's not here to seduce you again after going back on her word, is she? I thought she was nice for so readily agreeing to break up with you, but now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss seemed to realize something as she suddenly stopped talking in the middle of her sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss narrowed his eyes and stared at his mother. "What's the matter? Mom, were you involved in her decision to break up with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you talking about? I'm involved? Why would I be involved? Or did that woman say something to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After staring at Mrs. Weiss suspiciously for a moment, Martin Weiss said softly, "I'm tired. I'm going back to my room."</p></div>
