        <h1>Chapter 4125</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"They're here, they're here!" Suddenly, someone in the crowd shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina looked closely and indeed, there were several cars approaching in formation not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The security personnel at the venue were on high alert, seemingly afraid that the fans would rush forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eugenia was full of excitement. "Tina, they're here! I wonder which car Kit will be in!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">People started getting out of the cars one by one, and the surrounding shouts and screams mixed together into a noisy uproar, with each wave louder than the last.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit was the last one to get out of the car. Tina watched him from the crowd and felt that Kit looked particularly glamorous today, as if his makeup was more enchanting than usual!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as if feeling her gaze, Kit suddenly paused and looked in her direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina's heart skipped a beat. Did Kit see her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Immediately, Tina denied it because Kit lifted his feet and continued walking towards the special passage for the concert. Besides, there were so many people at the venue, the surroundings were noisy, and she even dressed up today just to disguise herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With wavy hair, wearing a baseball cap, and a delicate feminine makeup, she wanted to differentiate herself from her usual appearance and prevent those fans from recognizing her as the rumored leading lady!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the whole Kit group entered the venue, the noise outside gradually subsided.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina and Eugenia also followed the crowd and entered the venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It must be said that the two tickets Kit's father gave them had great seats. They were in the third row of the front section, right in the center. They could clearly see the performances on stage, even to the point of being close to their idols.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What great seats!" Eugenia couldn't help but exclaim. "You have to thank Edmond properly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I already thanked him earlier," Tina said. When she received the tickets, she called to express her gratitude!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">While the two were chatting, among the backstage makeup artists, a member of the same group asked Kit, "What happened just now when you suddenly stopped outside?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit raised an eyebrow, surprised that someone noticed such a small detail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Nothing, I just got distracted by the noise around me," he casually made up an excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Haha, you've been surrounded by fans before, are you scared?" the other person laughed. "But there are a lot of fans today, and I guess they all know that this is our last concert."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the concert, the group would announce their disbandment, and each member would establish their own studios.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing this, the expressions of the other members in the dressing room changed slightly. After all, the most feared thing after going solo was the impact on existing popularity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The popularity of the members in the group varied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Those with good popularity and strong business capabilities already had their future work lined up, just like Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Those with low popularity and poor business abilities still hadn't secured any work. Once the group disbanded, their future fate would truly be unknown, and even whether they could continue in the entertainment industry was uncertain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The one here who probably doesn't need to worry is Kit. I heard your work has already been arranged for next year!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I envy you. I only have an invitation for a variety show, and I haven't finalized any other work."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I haven't received any new work yet. I still haven't found a new manager! I don't even know how long I can stay in this industry. I still owe the company a lot of money!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I envy Kit so much. He's from a wealthy family and now has resources!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Exactly, being a second-generation rich is so popular now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although some people seemed to be praising Kit, there was a hint of envy and mockery between the lines.</p></div>
