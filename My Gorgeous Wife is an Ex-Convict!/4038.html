        <h1>Chapter 4036</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What, am I embarrassing you by surprising you like this?" Mick looked at Nancy's stunned expression and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I'm surprised." Nancy stammered, but what surprised her even more was - "You look so..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So?" Mick frowned slightly, not understanding what she meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So beautiful." She finally managed to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was taken aback, and the blush on his face became even more apparent!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Obviously, he didn't expect her to say something like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Beautiful? Since he started middle school, it seemed like no one had used that word to describe him, although he had heard a lot of compliments about his appearance, and the word "beautiful" was more often used to describe women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But hearing it from her mouth at this moment gave him a strange feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Beautiful? Do you think I'm beautiful like this?" He leaned down, his face close to hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think the way you blush is very charming." Nancy said shamelessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can't I make you feel that way when I'm not blushing?" He asked, his warm breath spraying on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Normally, of course... um, I'm also very moved, but I feel like you're different from usual, and I haven't seen this side of you before, so I'm especially... moved. That blushing face just makes me want to kiss you hard and take a bite..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy quickly explained, but as she went on, she started sweating profusely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oh my god, what was she even saying? Would he think she's a pervert for talking about kissing and biting him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, do you want to kiss and bite me?" He raised his hand and lightly touched her lips, and that handsome face seemed to easily evoke her deepest desires.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes." Almost without thinking, the word slipped out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good." He said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Huh? Nancy snapped out of it. What was he saying? Good?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was good?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next moment, Mick had already leaned in to her lips, "Then it's up to you, everything I have is yours, whether you want to bite or kiss, it's all good!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy stared at the man's flushed face in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her heart felt even itchier!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everything he had was hers?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she heard this, she felt a warm feeling in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She kissed his cheek, "Mick, everything I have is yours too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed like her love for him was growing more and more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's overflowing like it's too much...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A month later, Nancy was discharged from the hospital before the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her physical recovery was good, although not yet fully recovered, but the rest needed time for slow adjustment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of Nancy's current physical condition, she needed someone to take care of her, so she moved into the Reed family's mansion and stayed in Mick's room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for their daughter, Mick named her Sophia Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Nancy asked why they named the child "Sophia," Mick said, "Because this child was born too quickly, even before we were ready, so I hope that in her future life, she can slow down a bit. Sometimes, slowing down may be a kind of blessing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She already has a father like you, which is already a blessing." Nancy said, knowing that he would protect their daughter's life in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Having a mother like you is her blessing." Mick gazed at Nancy, his eyes becoming deep, and his voice becoming hoarse. "It's also my blessing."</p></div>
