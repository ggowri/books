        <h1>Chapter 507</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all thanks to your ex-girlfriend," said Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace?" Sean was stunned. He thought of the time when the Stevens family was almost out of luck because of Grace. However, his sister's leg was also crippled because of Grace. According to the doctor, it would be difficult for her to recover without a few surgeries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The surgeries were risky. A slight mistake might cause her to be disabled for the rest of her life. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, Zoe's personality had changed a lot during this time. She was no longer as fearless as she used to be. She used to be a little arrogant but was still cheerful. Now, Zoe spent her days in her room and rarely gathered with her old friends which worried Sean a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's the one. Jason has her back, so who can touch her?" Lily's tone was sour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the woman she thought she would trample on forever and whom she might never see again. After all, they were from different worlds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect her to reappear in front of her in such a way that made her afraid to do anything to Grace. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Sean suddenly seemed to understand something. "Did your family do something to Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily pursed her red lips, suddenly feeling a little guilty. "It was my fault for not warning my parents. As soon as they saw Grace, they were reminded of my sister. How could they not do something to Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell your parents to let it go. Grace was in prison for three years, and her future has been ruined. Obsessing over it will only make it harder for them." Sean urged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily immediately glared at Sean. "Why, are you feeling sorry for Grace now? Why didn't you feel sorry for her when she was in prison? All her nails were pulled out while the bones of her fingers were snapped off back then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean's face paled immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though more than three years had passed, the scene still emerged vividly in front of his eyes, never having faded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think you can distance yourself now that you care about Grace? Do you think Grace will put in a good word for you in front of Jason and help you out?" Lily's voice continued to ring in Sean's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you talking about?" Sean frowned and said, "It's all over between her and me. You are my wife now. I'm just afraid that your parents will go against Grace again. It's like throwing an egg against a rock. Only the Atkinson family will suffer. You've seen what happened with Zoe. What do you think Jason is incapable of doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily eventually said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean hugged Lily and said, "That's enough. I love you and I married you. As for Grace, I&rsquo;ve already made myself clear when you wanted to disable her arms. Isn't that enough? Doesn't that reassure you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Leaning into Sean's arms, Lily muttered, "Are you sure you don't regret&hellip; watching her suffer like that? If... she hadn't been in that car accident and didn&rsquo;t go to prison, would she be the one you love now? Will you still be with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The question had been weighing on her mind all these years and she finally dared to ask him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean was a little stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His mind went back to the days when he was dating Grace. The woman made him feel so wonderful. Though sometimes her sense of justice amused him a little, she was different from the upper-class ladies he had seen in his social circle. She was more energetic and radiant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if someone who had always been surrounded by conspiracies and schemes could not help looking forward to the light. Although his parents did not approve of him and Grace, he once thought that one day he would go against his parents for Grace and insist on marrying her.</p></div>
