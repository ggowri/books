        <h1>Chapter 1244</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you crying?" asked Jason as he walked forward with a slight frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sniffled. "Lina's parents... just called to tell me Lina has been transferred to her new hospital. Thank you." She thanked him sincerely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said lightly, "I'll naturally do it since I agreed to your conditions, so you have nothing to thank me for. After all, didn't you marry me for Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wiped his wet hair with a towel as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath, stepped forward, and said, "I'll... wipe it for you." He always liked to let her wipe his hair for him after he washed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stiffened slightly and looked at her. His dark eyes hidden behind his wet bangs grew darker. "Are you trying to please me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "You can assume I'm trying to please you. Even if we got married because of Lina, I don't want our marriage to be a bad one. After all, if you don't plan on divorcing me, then we're going to be with each other forever, aren't we? Do you want us to have a cold marriage for the rest of our lives?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was silent for a moment before he handed the towel to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Bend down," said Grace. He was so tall that she could not wipe his hair dry without him bending over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark eyes stared at her. He slowly bent down until they were at eye level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, their faces were so close that they were looking into each other's eyes. Grace could easily see her figure in his dark pupils.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes stared at her as if he did not want to miss a single expression on her face, but also as if he could see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt her cheeks burning slightly. Almost subconsciously, she threw the towel over his head and covered his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She held the towel with her hand and wiped his wet hair little by little. At this moment, she seemed to have a delusion that they had gone back to the way it was before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The hospital will come out with the risk assessment tomorrow, but... Jay, I really don't want to lose any of my three children. Every child is a human life. If I let one of them die in my belly, even if... everything of that child becomes a pile of medical waste when I give birth in the end, I don't know how I'll feel about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even thought she would regret it for the rest of her life if she did not save the child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said coldly, "You're not physically fit to have triplets. If the doctor still recommends a pregnancy reduction after tomorrow&rsquo;s risk assessment report, then I'll haul you to the operation table even if you don't want to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because he could not bear the possibility of losing her, not even a little bit!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you do that, I'll refuse. The current laws can&rsquo;t force me to have a pregnancy reduction. I won't let anyone touch my unborn child!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a bet to her. A bet she had to be responsible for. "If the pregnancy reduction has no risks, perhaps I would say yes so that the other two children could be born safely. However, the risk of putting the other two children in danger if I proceed with the pregnancy reduction is much higher than a normal one. I dare not take this risk!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason suddenly pulled the towel off his head, glared at the woman in front of him, and said, "Do you know what will happen if your body can't handle the three babies?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But my body should at least be able to hold out for the remaining four months!" Grace met Jason's glare without flinching. "If I can make it to 28 weeks, then even if we take the babies out early through C-section, there&rsquo;s a chance that the babies will survive, right?"</p></div>
