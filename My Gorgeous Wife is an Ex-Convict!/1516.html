        <h1>Chapter 1514</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the information was all real. There was really someone with the name Grace in L City, but the woman was an orphan. The photos in the documents depicting her life from a child to an adult all belonged to Grace, though.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The house she was supposedly renting came with clothes in her size and some photos of herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Due to this, she did not question anything at all then. She simply assumed that she lost her memories due to an accident. It was just that she did not know who the unborn child in her belly belonged to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she inexplicably had a feeling that she must have loved the father of her child a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Also&hellip; she always had a feeling that she had been carrying more than one child. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She continued living with the identity of this other Grace. In the past two years, though, she would dream about her life with another man. Her sixth sense told her that the man was the one she loved deeply and also Jaylee&rsquo;s father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the beginning, the man&rsquo;s face had always been blurry in her dreams. That caused her to make a fool of herself quite often. Whenever she came across men who had a similar stature and face structure to the man in her dreams, she would go up and ask about them, only to be disappointed every time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had also encountered men who tried to lie to her, but they would always reveal themselves after she asked some more questions about the happenings in her dreams. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Since last week, the man&rsquo;s face gradually became clearer and she eventually remembered the man&rsquo;s identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was Jason! The richest man in tMason Swansonty!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was the man in her dreams, the man she was married to and who loved her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although she had been plagued with amnesia for the past few years while living in L City, she had heard of Jason and knew of Reed group. Jason rarely showed his face in the media, though. There were only a few photos of him that showed his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had bought those photos her daughter was looking through right now online at a high price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Thanks to Jason&rsquo;s good looks, there were people on the internet who appreciated his looks greatly. They would acquire photos of him, which were obviously taken without permission, and sell them at a high price online. Only people who appreciated Jason&rsquo;s looks as much as them would buy the photos!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although Grace remembered Jason and some events in the past, she failed to remember the rest of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe she would finally remember everything when she saw Jason for real.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Mommy, did you really get married to Daddy? You didn&rsquo;t give birth to me before marriage, did you?&rdquo; the young girl asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Pfft!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace spewed all the water she had not managed to swallow and accidentally got some on her daughter too. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The child&rsquo;s face scrunched up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Sorry! I didn&rsquo;t do that on purpose,&rdquo; Grace apologized. She hurriedly wiped the water off her daughter before saying, &ldquo;Mommy and Daddy were really married. We gave birth to you after we got married! I promise.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The girl muttered, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t look like Daddy at all. Will he want me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Who said you don&rsquo;t look like him? You see&hellip; Uh&hellip;&rdquo; Grace tried hard to look for similarities between her daughter and Jason, but to be honest, their daughter looked more like her. &ldquo;Uh, your eyebrows are similar.&rdquo; She finally picked a feature of her daughter&rsquo;s that was similar to Jason&rsquo;s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The girl was not satisfied. She wrinkled her pretty brows and suddenly said, &ldquo;If Daddy doesn&rsquo;t want me, then I don&rsquo;t want him too. Can we go home if that happens?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Why do you think that he won&rsquo;t want you?&rdquo; Grace asked as she found it odd. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Because he hasn&rsquo;t tried to find us even after so long. He only likes my older brother, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p></div>
