        <h1>Chapter 2265</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not be able to take revenge on Martin Weiss alone, not to mention if she had to go up against the Reed and Stephenson families as well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the first time, Jacqueline Bowman regretted her actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she could have a do-over, she would not... have done that to Kyla!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla woke up to find herself trapped in a room with a musty smell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were covered with black cloth, so she could not tell whether it was day or night. However, she could feel that her hands and feet were bound. Someone must have casually laid her on the ground because she could feel the concrete floor beneath her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she could hear were two young men talking to each other. They seemed to be discussing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The moans she made when she woke up seemed to make the two youths&rsquo; conversation come to a halt. Moments later, one of them said, "Hey, you&rsquo;ve woken up? We'll get to work, then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But she's a little old. She&rsquo;s probably in her 30s. Speaking of which, this is our loss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's a little older, but she's still beautiful! It's a pity we have to cover her eyes. I'd like to see the look in her eyes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Obscenities poured out of both their mouths, and Kyla's heart sank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough. Do you want her to see us? Hurry up!" One warned the other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, someone yanked Kyla's clothes off and she immediately shouted, "No!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No?" The person laughed. "That's not up to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, you're unlucky to have fallen asleep in the car. We just wanted to steal a car but ended up with an extra woman. Now that we have you, we're going to have a good time with you. Don't worry. We won't kill you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla felt her clothes being torn apart. If this went on...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla immediately said, "You can't touch me! I'm the wife of the head of Weiss Group, Martin Weiss! I'm Mrs. Weiss. If you want money, I can cooperate with you to get the ransom as long as you&rsquo;re willing to release me. Just tell him an amount. Martin Weiss will be willing to save me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a brief silence. However, moments later, those hands resumed undressing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was obvious that the offer of getting ransom failed to change their minds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla did not really care much about her &lsquo;innocence.&rsquo; She was more concerned about the baby in her belly and was afraid of losing them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't touch me!" Kyla tried hard to calm herself down. 'If Martin Weiss can't frighten them, then only...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know Jason, Emerald City's Young master Reed? I'm close with the Reed family. I'm Mrs. Reed's best friend and I&rsquo;m the godmother to her three children. If you really lay a hand on me, not only Martin Weiss but the Reed family won't let you off either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Kyla said that, the hands that were tearing away at her clothes instantly stopped. The two guys were silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla then continued, "I haven&rsquo;t seen what you look like. If you let me go, I'll act as if this never happened and we'll all be fine. If you want money, you can think of a safe way to get it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, one of the voices said, "Are you joking with us? You're just the owner of a store. How could you be close to the Reed family and be the godmother of the Reed family's children..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop it!" Another voice shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The guy who spoke seemed to realize that he had accidentally spilled the beans and immediately stopped.</p></div>
