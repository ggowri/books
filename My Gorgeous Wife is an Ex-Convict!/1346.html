        <h1>Chapter 1345</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter even if you want to bully me," he said with his eyes fixed on her. "But no matter how much you want to bully me, just don't leave me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words somehow made her feel like something was pressing on her heart and that he was still uneasy about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... What was he uneasy about? They were already married. Their relationship was going pretty well now, and she had a feeling that they were gradually going back to the good old times they once shared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took his face in her hands and said very seriously, "There's no way I'm leaving."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he heard that, his eyes darkened faintly before a faint smile slowly appeared on the corners of his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile was so beautiful and captivating that she almost lost herself in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The onlookers around them were dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh! This woman's hands are holding Master Reed's face. Master Reed is even letting her... hold him that way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Moreover, Master Reed is smiling! You can't see such a smile anywhere else! It's like Master Reed only has eyes for that woman! All his smiles and tenderness are reserved for that woman only!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many women were looking at Grace with envy even though they were already pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those who knew Jason's identity were full of envy for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the media had not publicized Jason's marriage, they knew none of the glamorous socialites in Emerald City's high society could top this woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace came back to her senses, she realized she was holding Jason's face in public. Her cheeks instantly turned red. She quickly put down her hands and made it seem like she was ready to listen to the class attentively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the class began and the specialist called for volunteers to demonstrate, Grace looked at the two expectant fathers on stage, saying, "These two look a little familiar to me. I seem to have seen them somewhere."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "Maybe you saw them on the news. One is the president of Ocean Sky Real Estate, and the other is the head of New Web."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked and took another look at them. 'It really seems to be them!' She would sometimes come across news about the two when she surfed the web. These news articles were often attached with some photos, so they looked familiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Grace knew this hospital was an expensive private maternity hospital in Emerald City and the people who could afford to come here were usually those with good financial backgrounds, it was a bit exaggerating that these two random expecting fathers on stage were CEOs. They were both CEOs of major companies too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help quipping, "Tell me, do you think there are any other CEOs, heirs, and chairmen among these people in the class? If there are any more, we'll have enough players for a game of mahjong and you can just talk business at the mahjong table."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not only one mahjong table, but maybe three or four," said Jason. Then, he began reporting to Grace, "There's also the CEO of Gourmet's Here, the Asia regional manager of Aerospace Group, the general manager of Around The Island Travel Group's Emerald City branch..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These groups and companies Jason mentioned were not small companies. He only saw them when he came in and glanced around. He had no idea whether there were the heads of small companies among them.</p></div>
