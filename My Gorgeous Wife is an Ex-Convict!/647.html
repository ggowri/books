        <h1>Chapter 646</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Revealing?" Lina looked at her dress. It was an off-shoulder dress with the shoulders exposed and the skirt was short at the front while long at the back. The short part ended at the knees while the long part ended at the ankles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to how well the bust of the dress was positioned, it lifted her cup a notch, and at the same time, the waistline was positioned just right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In short, it gave the wearer the appearance of having larger breasts and a smaller waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These were the effects women dreamt of!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina raised her chest with her hands and said to Hadwin, "Don't you think I look sexy dressed like this? My figure looks a lot better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was suddenly speechless. Was she&hellip; Still a woman? She was talking about looking &lsquo;sexy&rsquo; in his presence! Did she not see him as a man at all?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if they were now boyfriend and girlfriend, in her heart, she did not see him as her boyfriend at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was probably nothing more than a vengeful debt collector to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're going to be the maid of honor in this dress, I guarantee you won't even be at the wedding!" Hadwin suddenly sneered and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Lina glared at Hadwin. "How could you? It's just a dress!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, you can try and see whether I can. No man likes to see his girlfriend in a revealing outfit," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While her outfit was stunning and certainly a feast for the eyes&hellip; It was enough for him to see. He did not want other men to see her in this dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially at Jason's wedding where there would be a lot of people attending. It was hard to say whether there would be men interested in her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was speechless and felt that Hadwin might indeed be able to do it, but the problem was... When she had accompanied him to banquets, he never once said anything about women who wore dresses more revealing than hers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, few dresses these days did not expose the shoulders!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin took out a dress from the row of dresses hanging beside him and said, "Here, this one suits you more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked at the dress he took and immediately rolled her eyes. It would cover her from head to toe! The only parts of her that would show were probably her two arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was about to retort when someone&rsquo;s phone rang. It was Grace's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Grace picked up the call, her face changed after hearing the sound coming from the other end of the phone. "Yes... Yes... I see. I... I'll be right there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice was shaking, even her hand holding the phone was shaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she hung up the phone, she immediately said to Jason, "My... My grandmother is dying, Jay! I'm going to see her right now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not even have time to change out of the wedding dress and got into Jason's car. Then, they drove off in the direction of her grandmother's town.</p></div>
