        <h1>Chapter 3501</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, can you help me put on the necklace? This necklace is like a lucky charm to me. I'm so happy to have it back," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," Mason replied, releasing the embrace and carefully putting the necklace on Veronica's slender neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica lifted her hand and gently stroked the pendant of the necklace. "Thanks to it, I was protected. But that day was really lucky for us. How did you get the clue to track it down?" she asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyelashes trembled slightly as he looked down at the pendant hanging on her neck. "It's a long story. I'll tell you another time," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," she said, thankfully not pressing for more information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason looked at the person in front of him. If she really asked further, what should he say? How could he tell her that there was a tracking device secretly installed in the necklace he gave her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he told her, would she be angry?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't want her to be angry again. It was hard enough for them to become intimate again. He didn't want any more cracks between them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, in the Reed family's study, Jason looked at his second son. Did he really have something to say to him alone? This gave him some sense of being a father to his second son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you going to talk to me about the kidnapping case?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm." Mason responded, then went straight to the point and asked, "When can Lionel be released on bail?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At least for now, he's not suitable for bail," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's not the mastermind," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason smiled, "He's not yet skilled enough to be the mastermind, at most he's just being used by someone else. You know it and I know it, but it's up to the court to decide, not us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can get him released on bail, I know you can," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason raised an eyebrow. "Are you pleading for him? Do you have some sort of brotherly bond with that kid from the Barlow family after all these years of knowing them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," Mason immediately rejected. "My brothers are Mick, Jasper, and Jasmine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, this son wants Lionel to be released on bail because of Veronica's relationship? Jason understood. "What about Veronica? Isn't she your sister?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She used to be, but not anymore," Mason said firmly, a certain determination flashing in his dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, Jason said, "Alright, I'll have Lionel released on bail. But did you find Veronica early this time because you put a tracking device in the necklace you gave her? Does she know about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's thin lips tightened and his face slightly changed, but he didn't say anything.</p></div>
