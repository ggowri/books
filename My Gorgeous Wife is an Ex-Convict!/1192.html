        <h1>Chapter 1191</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went into the interrogation room. The police's interrogation was over. Chase Harper&rsquo;s complexion appeared extremely bad, and he seemed to be at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw Grace come in, he frantically said, "Grace, I... I didn't do anything like that, and I don't know why that woman would set me up like that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper was dumbfounded. After all, such an emergency was not what he could handle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take your time and tell me what happened. Don't panic! I'm representing you now, and I'll help you with your case. You can change your lawyer later if you find someone more suitable," said Grace, reassuring him first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper finally calmed down. "Thank you, Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After about half an hour, the information Grace got from Chase Harper was that he was helping to get the report when Stella appeared beside him. She said that she had sprained her foot and asked him to help her to her car that was in the open-air parking lot of the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Stella was carrying many things and looked pitiful, Chase Harper helped her carry the heavy things to the parking lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella then asked Chase Harper to put the things in the backseat and even said that she could not see things clearly. She asked Chase Harper to turn on the flashlight with his phone to light the space for her. Without thinking further, Chase Harper got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next thing he knew, Stella closed the car door and put on a show of attempted rape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The witness was the person who came to pick up the car. There were five security guards in the parking lot, all of whom saw Stella jumping out of the car with a frightened look on her face while clutching her torn clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Half an hour passed quickly. Grace frowned after listening to what Chase Harper told her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The current situation was indeed unfavorable to Chase Harper, which meant... Stella had probably thought it through and planned it. It was not improvised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Why did Stella do it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was what Grace could not understand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I... I heard from the police that they&rsquo;re going to detain me and I have to go to jail if I&rsquo;m convicted, possibly for at least one or two years. I..." Chase Harper's face was full of fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could Grace not understand this fear? When she was detained for the car accident, she had been so frightened when she knew that all the evidence was against her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't panic. I'll help you. I surely will!" Grace said in an affirmative tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her determined expression, his fear was fading away little by little. "Grace, thank you!" Chase Harper said gratefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace got out of the interrogation room, Brian and Stella were still there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's phoenix eyes were staring at Grace. "Are you still determined to help Chase Harper?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's my friend. Besides, I believe he's innocent," said Grace.</p></div>
