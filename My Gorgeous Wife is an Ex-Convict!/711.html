        <h1>Chapter 710</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The look of warning from Jason was enough to let him know that he had better not have Grace on his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, Jason might lay his hands on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... After learning that Grace had been wronged, he sometimes could not help but wonder what would have happened to him and Grace if there was no accident or lawsuit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no matter how he thought, he no longer had the right to get close to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe in the future, he would even have to look up to that woman...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Jason looked at Grace and asked, "Are you still mad about what Lily said just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She nodded. "Sort of. I know very well that she only apologized to me because of you. It's just that she was so hypocritical in apologizing and even wanted me to forgive her. It's ridiculous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could a casual apology make up for the harm she had suffered?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes glistened as he took her hand in his again to look at her slightly deformed knuckles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew that she had not been treated well when she was in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure you can't forgive someone who has hurt you?" His words were forced out of his throat after some difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reply made his heart sink deeper and deeper. "Even if... The person who hurt you did it unintentionally?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If they had done it unintentionally, why would they have hurt me? Jason, if it were you, would you ever forgive someone who had hurt you?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He already had the answer in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would never let go of anyone who dared to hurt him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... If it was her, his heart did not know what the answer was anymore...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I'm not a saint. If someone's nice to me, I'll be nice to them too. However, if it's someone who has hurt me, I'll never forgive them," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lowered his eyes gently. "I won't let anyone hurt you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled sweetly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. Let's find Jewel Bailey. Don't you want to meet her?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace finally came to her senses. 'This is what we're here for!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come on." He took her hand and walked the other way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without much effort, Grace spotted Jewel Bailey in the corner of the fair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had watched many of Jewel Bailey's videos in court. Therefore, even though she had never met her before, she recognized her instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to her surprise, the person Jewel Bailey was talking to at the moment was... Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was... The man Kyla made every effort to avoid as well as Nelson's father!</p></div>
