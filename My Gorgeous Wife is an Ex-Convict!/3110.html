        <h1>Chapter 3108</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian followed along as she was being pushed into the filming studio. She endured the pain and lifted her hand to touch Brian's face. "Brian...please don't blame yourself. I don't like seeing you like this. I'm...I'm okay, don't worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was stunned, she was clearly in pain, but she still forced a smile and said she was fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She doesn't know that she's causing him so much pain that he can hardly breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His hand covered hers, "I'll wait for you outside, don't worry, I'll make sure nothing happens to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was pushed into the CT room, while Brian waited on a chair outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Camille also ran over and anxiously asked Brian, "How is Valda doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Still checking, need to wait and see the results after taking the X-ray," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Seriously, how did Valda end up in this situation? Wasn't she just in the restroom? How did she get hurt like this?" Camille is confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's eyes turned cold and he exuded a terrifying aura. "That person deserves to die. I will never let him go! And as for that film crew...Valda is injured like this, how can they continue filming?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Camille immediately understood that Valda's injury was likely caused by the film crew currently shooting in the mall. And now that Brian was saying this, it meant that the film crew was in trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However... Camille thought for a moment and remembered seeing on the news that a film crew would be shooting at a mall in Winnipeg today. She just didn't pay attention to which mall it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, the production team is a high-budget one, and the actors they hired are all high-priced celebrities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This film crew, are they really going to disappear just like that?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it were someone else speaking, Camille might not believe it, but if it's coming from Brian, she really has no choice but to believe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Valda was pushed out of the CT room and Camille and Brian quickly went to meet her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is she doing?" Brian asked the doctor who went in with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The injury didn't reach the bones, but due to the fall and being dragged for a distance, it aggravated the previous injury and also resulted in a sprained foot. That's why the pain is so severe. A painkiller injection will be administered shortly to alleviate the pain." answered the doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then quickly give her a painkiller injection," Brian said, not wanting to see her in so much pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctor responded with a nod.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille kept talking to Valda to distract her attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, when Valda was pushed into the ward and given a painkiller injection, she fell asleep shortly after because the painkiller contained some sedative ingredients.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille let out a long sigh as she looked at Valda, who had fallen asleep. "Valda had a really tough day today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian gently brushed Valda's messy hair away from her forehead and said, "Yes, she suffered. This could have been avoided if I had protected her better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If only I had accompanied her to the restroom, this wouldn't have happened!" Camille blames herself for what happened today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyone who caused her suffering, don't even think about escaping," Brian said, taking out his phone and dialing a number. "Which film crew was shooting at the Poly Plaza today? Also, pull up all the surveillance footage from around the mall between 11:50am and 12:10pm and show me everything. I want to know what happened during that time at the filming location!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, Brian put away his phone and sat quietly by Valda's bedside, keeping watch over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking into Valda's eyes, there was an indescribable tenderness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That is... the look in the eyes of someone you love the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille couldn't help but sigh in her heart as she looked at Brian like this. How could Valda think that Brian only felt sympathy for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This love, even outsiders can see it clearly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or perhaps, sometimes emotions can cloud one's judgment as the person involved in the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because Valda loves Brian so much, is that why she's afraid of his love? Is it just out of pity?</p></div>
