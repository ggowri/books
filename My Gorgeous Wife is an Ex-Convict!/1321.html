        <h1>Chapter 1320</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, what on earth is going on? Why are you suddenly giving up Nelson's custody?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The odds of winning are slim, and... as you can see, I only run a food stall. I can't make a lot of money. Nelson will need more money in the future. If he's with me, he won&rsquo;t be able to go to a good school and I have no extra money for him to attend after-school classes either. What more food and clothing expenses? I&rsquo;ll only be able to give him the worst things!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurriedly said, "I can provide Nelson a better life! I like Nelson very much. I think of him as my godson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, Grace." Kyla Corbyn forced a smile. "You've helped enough, but... if Nelson didn&rsquo;t have a father, I might have accepted your kindness. But since he has a father and his father can provide him with a better life, then he should be with his father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Kyla, do you have the heart to do so?" asked Grace. Since becoming pregnant, she had become more aware of the kinship between a child and its mother. Besides, Kyla had raised Nelson for four years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn murmured, "I have to do it even if I don't have the heart to do so. I just want to choose the best path for Nelson. I hope he'll understand my efforts."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But what you think is the best path may not be the path Nelson wants. Does he know he's going to live with Martin Weiss from now on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I haven't told him yet. I'll hand him to Martin Weiss in three months. I plan to tell him about it then." Let these three months be her last happy moments with her son. "Grace, don't tell Nelson about this, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's eyes were full of implorations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Kyla, this is not the time to take this step. I already told Jay to find the attending doctor who performed the abortion when Paisley Daniels fell down the stairs. As long as Paisley Daniels wasn't carrying Martin Weiss's child, I can prove that you were set up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla Corbyn's expression did not change when she heard Grace&rsquo;s words. "It doesn't matter whether I was set up or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could it not matter? Kyla, do you want to live with this crime for the rest of your life?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked down. 'The rest of my life... I may very well be doomed to this crime for the rest of my life.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, thank you for all you've done for me, but... enough is enough. Really! Handing over Nelson to Martin Weiss is the result of my careful deliberation. It&rsquo;s not a decision I made on the spur of the moment! It's just that..." she paused and said a little imploringly, "If Nelson ever needs your help, please help him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, I would help if anything happened to Nelson, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no matter what Grace said, Kyla Corbyn had made up her mind and did not want to change it. Grace could only give up for now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace kept thinking about what Kyla Corbyn said all night. As a result, she tossed and turned and could not sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Can't sleep?&rdquo; asked Jason who lay beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did... I wake you up?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," said Jason. Every day, he would wait for her to fall asleep before falling asleep himself. "Were you thinking about Kyla Corbyn?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She replied, "Yeah. Why do you think Kyla suddenly changed her mind and gave up custody of Nelson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe it's just what she said. Handing over Nelson to Martin Weiss is the best choice for the child," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sighed. "Anyway, continue helping me find the attending doctor. Maybe we can find them and find out the truth. That way, Martin Weiss will let Kyla raise Nelson and everyone will be happy."</p></div>
