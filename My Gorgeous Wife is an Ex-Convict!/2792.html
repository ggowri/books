        <h1>Chapter 2790</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman said and left. Raymond Bowman looked down, bitterness all over the corners of his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Pay the price? I've already paid a painful price!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What cost me is that Valda Theller's eyes no longer contain love for me. I've missed out on the person I love in this life!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the following days, Valda Theller could feel the people around her treating her differently. Even the two assistants in her studio would look at her from time to time at work, joking about whether she was getting married into a rich family soon!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you talking about? Brian and I are only dating right now," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But if it goes on well, won't it lead to marriage?" one of the assistants asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I read online that the crown prince hasn't had a girlfriend in years. Sis Valda, you're the crown prince's first girlfriend after so many years!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could not help laughing. Her two assistants thought Brian loved her, but only she knew he did not love her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their relationship was only a bet. She was betting on him falling for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone on the film set became respectful to Valda Theller. They finally understood why Queenie Mack and those who went on strike ended up in such a situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was with the crown prince. These people had hit a snag!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, other than respect, there were also many jealous and mocking gazes. Some people even secretly discussed when the crown prince would dump Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Valda Theller looked ordinary in the show business, where there were so many beautiful women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, are you really Young Master Hart's girlfriend?" The female lead of the film set next door deliberately came to the film set that Valda Theller was in to ask this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller recognized this actress. She had starred in several TV dramas and was quite popular.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she replied. Since she had chosen to date Brian, she should be ready to bear it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to Brian's identity, she was destined to bear a lot of criticism in this particular industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you become Young Master Hart's girlfriend? You must have pulled some tricks. Why don't you share them with me? If I ever have the chance to be Young Master Hart's girlfriend, I won't forget about your kindness. I won't leave out the benefit you deserve, of course," she said. It was no longer a hint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she was certain that Valda Theller would soon break up with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you think it's rude of you to say that? You not only insulted me but also yourself!" Valda Theller said bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled. "I'm just being direct. I mean no harm. Besides, I think you should be well aware of your position, Miss Theller. How long do you think you can be Young Master Hart's girlfriend based on your looks and family background?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If that's what you think, then you'll never become his girlfriend," said Valda Theller. The more she knew that man, the more she understood that he was not shallow and cynical. On the contrary, he took his relationships more seriously than anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." She glared at Valda Theller. "Why are you so smug? You're just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller immediately interrupted her and said, "I'm Brian's girlfriend. You're preparing to steal my boyfriend in front of me. Do you think I should be polite to people like you? What do you think will happen to you if I tell Brian what you just said to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How dare you?" There was a look of panic in her eyes.</p></div>
