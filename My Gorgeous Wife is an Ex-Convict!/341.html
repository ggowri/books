        <h1>Chapter 340</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Previously, on this day, Jason would not leave Reed Residence even if it was at night. Not even if there was a big event. He would spend the night at his father's spirit tablet, telling himself not to repeat his father's mistakes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This went on year after year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, tonight was different!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was led out of the hospital by Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A black car pulled up in front of the hospital. After getting into the car, Grace still felt like she was dreaming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought tonight was going to be her nightmare, but she did not expect him to show up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you scared?" he asked as he put his hand over hers, which was still shaking even now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lower lip and nodded her head. Yes, how could she not be afraid? It was as if her fate was completely in the hands of someone else, and all her struggles were so powerless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if someone else's word could determine her life and death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's my fault," Jason said. "I didn't think the old man would touch you. I can't believe he&rsquo;s more impatient than I thought and would even choose this day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was a little stunned. "What's special about&hellip; today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his face changed a little as she asked this question. He pursed his thin lips and his beautiful deep eyes were staring at her as if he was going to swallow her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The atmosphere in the car suddenly became depressive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt uncomfortable and tried to withdraw her hand, but Jason tightened his fingers even more and squeezed her hand. He stared at her for a long time before turning to look out of the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was puzzled. Was there something she could not say about this day?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he was staring at her, she felt as if she had touched a taboo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car arrived at Reed Residence, and Grace followed Jason out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's late. You should go to bed. The old man touched you today and already got the answer he wants. He will not simply touch you again in the future, so you needn't be afraid," said Jason. After all, they were family. He gave it some thought and understood why the old man chose today of all days to do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason then walked Grace back into her room. The moment she entered the room, she discovered that he was not going to his room next door. Instead, he went down the stairs on the other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was going downstairs?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, she lied in bed, tossing and turning for some reason. He was unable to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason walking toward the stairs haunted her mind. Where... was he going? Was he not going back to his room? She felt that he was a little different tonight than he usually was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sitting up, she looked hesitantly at the door between their rooms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just had to push open the door and she would know if he had gone back to his room, but...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stop being curious! Curiosity killed the cat! There should not be any curiosity for a man like Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She kept saying this to herself in her mind, but her hand could not help pushing open the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was dark, and she looked around the room with the light from her room. Sure enough, there was no one there.</p></div>
