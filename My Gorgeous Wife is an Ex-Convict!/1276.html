        <h1>Chapter 1275</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tip of her nose suddenly felt sore. She was touched by what he had done for her, but... perhaps it could only be said that she did not know what love was when she had first met him. She only thought of him as a friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she remembered everything afterward, her heart was already occupied by another person. She could not spare any extra affection to love another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she gave him a decisive answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked as though he had been struck by lightning, and his phoenix eyes were full of pain. "Why are you so sure you won't? You just said that to make me give up, didn't you? Because you're already married to Jason and pregnant with his children, so you can only tell me that, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No. Even if I hadn't married Jay and had no children, I would still have told you that," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then do you love him? Do you love Jason?" Both of his eyes were staring intently at her. It was as if he was hoping with all his might that she could deny it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before Grace could speak, another voice rang out. "What does it have to do with you whether she loves me or not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shuddered and quickly turned around to look at where the voice came from. She only saw Jason walking into the studio, his handsome face full of anger. "Brian, when did you have the galls to take my wife away so casually? If there's a next time, Hart Group&rsquo;s building will be razed to the ground!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian seemed not surprised that Jason could break into the mansion and find his way here. His eyes were still staring intently at Grace, however. "What's the matter? Can't you give me an answer? Yes... or no?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace's hand and said, "Come on, let's go home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only after he took a step that he realized she had not moved and was still standing where she was. Her almond-shaped eyes were looking at Brian as if he was the only one who existed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's heart suddenly tensed. The five fingers that were holding her hand unconsciously tightened, and panic came over him. Then, he saw her pink lips parting slightly as she said word by word, "Yes, Jay is the one I love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason suddenly stiffened and looked at the woman in front of him in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian burst into laughter. "You're lying. If you really loved him, how could you have gone down on your knees and begged him to let you go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to the way the two men looked right now, Grace seemed the calmest. "Because I thought I could forget him and let go of my feelings for him, but I couldn&rsquo;t. He has always been in my heart. Besides, I've sworn before his father's memorial tablet that I would stay by his side for the rest of my life and be a good wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's thin lips were pressed together tightly. The shock on his face slowly turned into grimness. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unconvinced, Brian said, "He forced you to swear, didn't he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said seriously, "No, I did it of my own accord! Nobody forced me. Brian, everything I say to you is true. I'm going to have a good life with Jay and be happy, so you can stop being in love with me."</p></div>
