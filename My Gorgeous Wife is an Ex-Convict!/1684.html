        <h1>Chapter 1682</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The scene that just flashed through her mind was of him pushing the button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old master Reed's recording also mentioned he would be blown up once he pushed the button, but all he did was comfort her and tell her not to be afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll deal with Sean from now on, okay? Don't ever see him or anyone from the Stevens family again." Jason gently kissed Grace's collarbone as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was still so absorbed in the memory that she did not come to her senses until she felt him sucking on her collarbone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She met his peach blossom eyes that were as deep as the sea. "What were you thinking just now?" he asked as he stared at her. She was obviously distracted just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I mentioned Sean, so was she thinking about Sean? Was she thinking about what Sean had said to her today or what she and Sean once had?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Nothing. I just think you&rsquo;re right. If you were by my side, you would&rsquo;ve given everything to protect me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So, can you stop seeing Sean and the Stevens family?" he repeated what he had said before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She chuckled. "I never planned on seeing them again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You wouldn't do anything for him even if he begged you again?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Now that I've repaid him for saving me, we're even. I have no reason to help him." Sean was even the one who hurt her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's great," he murmured as his lips touched her collarbone again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could not help moaning. When he used the tip of his tongue to lick her collarbone, she trembled. "Jay..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How sweet," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her face turned a deep shade of red. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, love me," he muttered her name and kissed her collarbone before slowly going to her neck, jaw, and eventually, her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She put her hands against his chest and accepted his kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But... I have to pick up Mick and Jasper soon," she spoke with a gasp when the kiss was over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then it'll only take a while... I won't delay you from picking them up," he said with desire in his delicate eyes, which were also exuding a charm at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her eyes could hardly move away from his face. She felt as though her heart and soul were drawn by the look in his eyes. He was charming, gorgeous, and even irresistible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Love me. I want you... to love me harder..." His hoarse voice was the most enchanting sound to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He carried her in his arms, gently lay her on the bed, and unbuttoned her shirt he had just buttoned earlier...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was a weekend the next day. Grace and Jason took their son and daughter to attend a musical instrument exhibition held in Emerald City. There would be many world-class musical instruments and best-sellers of well-known brands displayed there. Jasper was learning to play the piano and wanted to visit the exhibition, so they had planned to come here a week ago.</p></div>
