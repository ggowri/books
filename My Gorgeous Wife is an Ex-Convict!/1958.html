        <h1>Chapter 1956</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He glanced at her. Whatever was on her mind was written all over her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Pressing his thin lips slightly, Hadwin Stephenson drove Lina to the Stephenson family&rsquo;s mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze. Hesitation and worry appeared on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "Don't worry. My mother doesn't live here, and she seldom comes over. Besides, I&rsquo;ve already told her not to touch you. At least, she won't touch you for now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"For now?" Lina bit her lip. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does that mean his mother will still give me trouble in the future?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not mind but was worried the baby would get hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"As long as you don't abort the baby in your belly, they'll be born safely!" said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze and looked at him expectantly. "Are you going to accept the baby? You&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"They're my child. Of course, I&rsquo;ll accept them, but that doesn't mean I&rsquo;ll accept you." His words dimmed the light in her eyes as if they had rained on her parade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Lina also told herself that their one-month arrangement had just started. She still had time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, he was much nicer to her now than when she first arrived in J City. As long as he had feelings for her, she would not give up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina followed Hadwin Stephenson out of the car and entered Stephenson Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the maids there saw the redness and swelling on Lina's face, they were calm. There was no other look on their face, and they did not even peek at her. They looked as if their master had just brought back an ordinary guest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This actually made Lina more comfortable. It seemed that the Stephenson family's maids were well trained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Arrange a guest room for Miss Sweeney," Hadwin Stephenson told the butler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," the butler replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well, can you please have me stay in a room closer to Hadwin's bedroom?" Lina hurriedly added a condition. When she met Hadwin Stephenson's gaze, she smiled meekly. "Your home is quite big and it's... It's my first time here. I'm scared of getting lost. If I were closer to your bedroom, it&rsquo;d be easier for me to find you if anything happens."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson pursed his thin lips as he stared at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina only found her swollen cheeks hotter now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, Hadwin Stephenson finally restrained his gaze and said to the butler, "Do whatever she wants."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," the butler answered, but they were secretly shocked. Though Miss Sweeney looked like a mess, she was probably important to Mr. Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the butler was about to leave, they heard Lina say to Hadwin Stephenson, "Hadwin, can you ask your driver to go to the small hotel I'm staying in and get my pregnancy pillow? I have to sleep with a pregnancy pillow now. It's uncomfortable to sleep without it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The butler nearly slipped and fell over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Pregnancy pillow? Is this lady pregnant? And whose baby would that be?</p></div>
