        <h1>Chapter 362</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll listen to you. So, are you willing to like me?&rdquo; When he said that, she started to feel slightly hesitant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If&hellip; If he was not Jason, perhaps&hellip; she might like him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was Jason. During the three years in prison, his existence was like a nightmare to her. He was someone she feared from the bottom of her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt that she did not even know what was going on between her and Jason anymore. She was scared of him. She was terrified of him, but sometimes, she could not control herself from worrying about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he looked at her with such a serious expression on his face and said those touching words, she would once again be at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he really treating her as a game or was he being serious? What about her? Did she feel anything for him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only let this progress slowly. It was as if she had sunk into a swamp. She wanted to get out of there, but she was sinking deeper and deeper instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She finished delivering all of the takeouts. Grace went back to the restaurant and was stunned. Someone was sitting in the restaurant. According to reason, this person&mdash;Brian&mdash;would never appear in such a small restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was wearing a fitting suit. His handsome face looked elegant, but he still looked as unapproachable as ever. This man could appear at a luxurious party or a budget cafe with a nice atmosphere. He could appear at the balcony of a presidential suite, but he would never appear in a small and cheap restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, Grace did not see Kyla anywhere. However, Mrs. Corbyn was at the counter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Brian saw Grace. He stood up and walked to her. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;d actually be working here.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I saw you on your battery-powered bike yesterday. I saw the words &lsquo;Yan Yan Restaurant&rsquo; on the delivery bag behind your bike, so I came here,&rdquo; Brian said. There was a hint of kindness on his indifferent face that even he did not even notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Grace, there are three more orders. Please deliver them,&rdquo; Mrs. Corbyn called out to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; Grace walked to the counter and took the takeouts that were placed on the counter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn asked Grace in a small voice, &ldquo;Is that your friend?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head and said, &ldquo;Just an acquaintance.&rdquo; She did not say he was her friend because she did not think she was able to claim connections with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she felt strange. Even if he saw the restaurant&rsquo;s name on her delivery box, he did not need to come and eat here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he&hellip; waiting for her? This thought appeared in her brain briefly, but she shut it down quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was about to exit the shop with her takeouts, Brian asked suddenly, &ldquo;Are you going to deliver those?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yeah, my main job here is to deliver takeouts,&rdquo; Grace answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Did Jason ask you to do a job like this?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with this job,&rdquo; Grace said nonchalantly. &ldquo;I like being able to earn my own money. I think that&rsquo;s great.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she said that, she walked toward her battery-powered bike and put the food on the bike.</p></div>
