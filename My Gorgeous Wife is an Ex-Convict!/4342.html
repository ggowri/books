        <h1>Chapter 4340 So It Was Just About Being Suitable After All</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;There&#x27;s no such &#x27;if&#x27;, she is the daughter of the Hart family!&quot; Lornell said coldly, &quot;And I&#x27;ve never liked to speculate on &#x27;ifs&#x27;. For me, there are no &#x27;ifs&#x27; in life!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">After saying this, Lornell couldn&#x27;t be bothered to give Ursula another glance and just walked away.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Ursula stood frozen in place, her face pale as a ghost. She clenched her hands, which hung limply by her sides, in a show of defiance.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She believed that her humble beginnings were the reason she couldn&#x27;t be with Lornell.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If she had a family background like Harley&#x27;s, she might be the one engaged to Lornell today!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Perhaps Lornell will fall in love with her because of this!</p><p style="text-align:left;">It was just because she didn&#x27;t come from a good family, simply because the life God initially gave her was not good!</p><p style="text-align:left;">But she didn&#x27;t just give up like this!</p><p style="text-align:left;">One day, she lived a better life than others, making those who once looked down on her not dare to underestimate her again.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When others introduced her, she was no longer just a distant relative of the Quentin family!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Meanwhile, on the other side, Harley, who was hiding in a corner, couldn&#x27;t help but let out a bitter laugh.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She went back because she suddenly wanted to greet her parents with Lornell. She didn&#x27;t want her parents to feel uneasy about her situation. At least on the surface, she hoped her parents would think Lornell was treating her well.</p><p style="text-align:left;">But what Harley didn&#x27;t expect was that she overheard the conversation just now.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Turns out, Lornell really didn&#x27;t love her at all. He was only with her because she was a suitable choice.</p><p style="text-align:left;">If she didn&#x27;t have the backing of the Hart family, Lornell probably wouldn&#x27;t give her a second glance!</p><p style="text-align:left;">And Harley, she didn&#x27;t even dare to step forward just now!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Only after Lornell and Ursula had left did Harley slowly emerge from the corner.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Perhaps Harley should be grateful. She just came back and heard all this. Otherwise, she wouldn&#x27;t know to what extent she&#x27;s been deceiving herself!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Harley took a deep breath, then turned around and left.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She thought she would cry, but she didn&#x27;t!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Perhaps Harley had already harbored such suspicions in her heart, or maybe she was just tired of love for too long. So, when she heard Lornell say this, she actually felt a sense of relief, as if a heavy burden had been lifted.</p><p style="text-align:left;">When she returned to the lobby, Harley once again saw Lornell.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lornell stepped forward, &quot;I haven&#x27;t greeted your parents today. Would you accompany me to say hello?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Alright,&quot; Harley responded nonchalantly, walking over to her parents with Lornell.</p><p style="text-align:left;">At that moment, Brian and Valda were chatting with Lornell&#x27;s parents and grandfather, as well as some relatives from the Quentin family.</p><p style="text-align:left;">After Harley and Lornell walked over, everyone looked at this young couple with smiles.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;ve grown up so fast. Once Harley graduates, we could start considering their marriage,&quot; said Lornell&#x27;s dad.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Yes, get married sooner, so we can have a grandchild earlier. Lornell&#x27;s grandfather is also eager to see his great-grandchild!&quot; chimed in Lornell&#x27;s mother.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Lornell&#x27;s grandfather watched them with a smile, while Valda looked at her daughter with some concern, wanting to say something, but was held back by Brian.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Brian began, &quot;Harley still has a few years until graduation. If the two young people are really that in love, then it would be a good thing for them to get married and start a family after graduation.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, if the relationship wasn&#x27;t that strong, then naturally, a lot could have changed over the years!</p></div>
