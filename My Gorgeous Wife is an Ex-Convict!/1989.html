        <h1>Chapter 1987</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the same day, Emily Flowers held a press conference and said that she would never acknowledge the baby in Lina's stomach as the Stephenson family's future heir. She also openly doubted that the baby in Lina's stomach was not her son's. At the same time, Emily Flowers stated that Lina was only a vain woman who thought she could get to the top with the baby in her stomach and she hoped her son would not be deceived again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If her son persisted, she would use her ten percent shares in Stephenson Group to join forces with other shareholders to oppose her son from remaining as Stephenson Group's president.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because a man fooled by a woman was no longer fit to be president.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers made an impassioned speech at the press conference, saying that she must protect Stephenson Group, which was left by her late husband. Even though Hadwin Stephenson was her own son, she could not sit idly by and watch her son destroy the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the office, Hadwin Stephenson looked coldly at the video of the press conference on the computer screen and smiled sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It seems that the more you don't want something to happen, the more likely it&rsquo;ll happen. Mom is taking things this far. Upon realizing that her pawn has stopped being obedient, she plans to deprive me of everything and find a new obedient pawn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is she trying to take my power and take control of Stephenson Group?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But she seems to have forgotten that I gave her that ten percent of shares. Since I could give it to her, I've thought of all possible consequences.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina, who was resting in Stephenson Residence, saw the press conference too. When Hadwin Stephenson came home, Lina said uneasily, "I'm sorry. You and your mother are in this state because of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although she disliked Emily Flowers, she was his mother, after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "You're just a trigger. Even without you, my mother and I would have come to this point sooner or later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was a look of confusion in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said sarcastically, "To my mother, I'm just a pawn for her to gain power and wealth. The most important thing for a pawn is to obey. If it stops obeying, she would need to get a new one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's face was full of shock, not expecting the mother and son's relationship to be... this way. Although he seldom mentioned his mother when they were dating, she thought he was reluctant to do so because of his family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she felt a little heartbroken after the shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When they met in a foreign country, he looked like a simple young man to her, innocent and sunny. However, she never expected him to carry so many burdens.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, don't look at me like that. It's as if I'm pathetic." Hadwin Stephenson looked at the woman before him, who seemed like she was about to burst into tears. He said, "I don't mind being a pawn. Even if I'm going to be someone's pawn someday, I'll probably be willing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After so many years, he was used to having his mother treat him like a pawn. They had never been close anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even now, how was he not Lina's pawn? Even though she said nothing, he was willing to fight for her. If she was going to use him one day, then... all she needed to do was ask him. He would be willing to do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next moment, those slender arms were wrapped around him with such force that her melodious voice broke a little. "You're not a pawn. You're you, not anyone's pawn!"</p></div>
