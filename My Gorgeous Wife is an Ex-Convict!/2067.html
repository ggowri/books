        <h1>Chapter 2065</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"See something? What did you see?" Kyla thought of what Martin Weiss said when he left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He just showed me two people having combat training." Nelson's eyes lit up at the mention of that. "Well... It's different from taekwondo."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Unlike taekwondo, which required a lot of posturing, it was more of a real fight. One could avoid attacks and strike back at one&rsquo;s opponent hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Taekwondo... did seem less practical compared to that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did you like what you saw today? Do you not like taekwondo anymore?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I can become stronger and protect you better!" Nelson Corbyn's young voice said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's heart broke a little when she heard that. The hardships of life had caused her son to think maturely at such an early age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I know you've always wanted to protect me, but you're still too young to carry such a heavy burden. I'll protect you for now. You'll grow up and protect me when you're old enough, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, there was <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>still more than a decade to go before her son grew up. Could she protect her child during these years? Could she withstand all the trouble outside, people's discrimination, strange gazes, and all kinds of sarcasm?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla only felt as if something was pressing down on her heart, making her breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day, Martin Weiss arrived at Kyla's store. "You didn't scold Nelson for leaving with me yesterday, did you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "Why would I scold him? You're Nelson's father. I won't stand in his way if he ever wants to follow you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All she wanted was for her son to live a better life. She did not care about anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes darkened. "Nelson matters the most to you, doesn't he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes!" she answered with absolute certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So can you also marry me for Nelson to give him a better life?" The words could not help escaping his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even he had no idea what to expect from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If she refuses, does that mean her hatred for me surpasses Nelson&rsquo;s importance to her? But if she says yes, even if we marry, all she cares about is our son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Martin Weiss, what are you looking forward to?' he asked himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"There's no way I'm going to marry you," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes narrowed instantly. "You refuse?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She said, "Yes, I refuse! If we do get married, the marriage will be without love. I don't think a family like that can bring much positive energy to children."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said, "Didn't you consider what I said to you the other day at the police station? Do you still want Nelson to be bullied and discriminated against? Besides, families with both parents present are better for children's development."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla hesitated and said, "Nelson still has a long road ahead of him. If there are any ups and downs in life, they are what he must go through. I believe he can overcome them, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to protect him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked coldly at Martin Weiss at the mention of that. &ldquo;Even if it's true that a family with both parents present is good for Nelson's development, it's not like I have to start a family with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's expression changed slightly as he frowned. 'Does that mean she'll choose another man if she wants to have a family?'</p></div>
