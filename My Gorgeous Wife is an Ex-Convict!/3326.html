        <h1>Chapter 3324</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, someone else's child will also be her son-in-law in the future. It is said that Lina is hoping to transform her own daughter's stubborn genes with Chandler's good learning genes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, although prenatal education by reading fairy tales may seem useless to Brian, given the existence of a negative example like Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he still reads a few stories to the unborn child every day, and can't help but imagine the scene of holding a soft little one and telling stories after the child is born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He has imagined this scene many times since Valda became pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Valda, who was listening to the fairy tale, suddenly changed her expression and let out a sharp scream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" Brian immediately became nervous. "Are you uncomfortable somewhere? Or is your leg cramping again?" He said, trying to lift the blanket covering her legs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face turned pale and she said, "No... it's not cramping. I think, maybe, my water broke."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Brian quickly told Valda to lie down and placed a pillow under her to prevent more amniotic fluid from flowing out. Then he immediately made a phone call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before this, Brian had prepared various emergency plans, so Valda quickly got into a professional ambulance and headed to the designated hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda couldn't help but sigh again as she looked at the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her previous understanding, if her water broke or there was an emergency, she would call 120 and an ambulance would be dispatched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, he went ahead and bought an ambulance with all the necessary equipment on board. He even hired qualified medical personnel who are available 24/7 to provide emergency assistance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So at this moment, even though Valda's water has broken, she is feeling quite calm now, except for the initial panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, her beloved husband has already made complete preparations for her sake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian is actually feeling nervous, in contrast to her relaxed demeanor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the doctor next to him had already told Brian that Valda was doing fine, Grace's face remained pale and her hands were trembling slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even so, he tried to calm Valda down by saying, "It's okay, don't worry. You will be able to give birth to the baby smoothly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To take a step back, even if there is a real issue and a choice needs to be made, all he wants is for her to be okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He can give up everything else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't say these words in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda thinks that something is up right now, and it seems to be him instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will take good care of giving birth to the child. I am aware of the precautions, as well as the steps and procedures involved in childbirth," Valda said as she reached out and held Brian's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His hands are very cold at the moment, and with the trembling, one can imagine his nervousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay, Brian. I'll be fine," Valda reassured him. As a man who was always in control, Brian had never seen him so nervous before. But Valda knew that his anxiety was all because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, everything will be fine, we will be safe," Brian lowered his head and kissed Valda's hand, as if trying to calm his emotions at the moment.</p></div>
