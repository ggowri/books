        <h1>Chapter 2290</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Answer&hellip; I can never give him the answer he wants.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He reached out to take her cold hand and said apologetically, "I'm not forcing you. I just long for it. I said I'd wait, and I'll wait however long it takes for you to be willing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would wait until she wanted to be with him willingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath. "I'll get back to you when you&rsquo;re discharged, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a gleam of joy in his eyes when he heard that. Even his voice became a little agitated. "Okay, I'll wait for your answer on that day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then get a good night's sleep, or the doctor may postpone your discharge again," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I must let the doctor discharge me soon," quipped Martin Weiss. He closed his eyes this time and missed the agony in Kyla's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Discharge... The sooner he&rsquo;s discharged, the sooner our sweet days will come to an end.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Martin Weiss fell asleep, Kyla carefully withdrew her hand and left the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She saw Mrs. Weiss as soon as she got out of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Goodbye, Aunt," Kyla said politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Corbyn, don't forget what you promised me," said Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled faintly. "I won't forget it. Since I've promised you, I&rsquo;ll keep my word. But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused and looked straight at Mrs. Weiss. "I'm not doing this because you asked me to. It's only because I... wish him a safe life too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Kyla turned around to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss looked at Kyla's back with complicated eyes before finally heaving a long sigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla returned to the store, Mrs. Corbyn said to her daughter, "Didn't you say the other day that you&rsquo;re going to be with Martin Weiss? Isn&rsquo;t Martin Weiss's mother also in Emerald City these days? Why don't I&hellip; go to the hospital with you tomorrow and meet his mother to talk about you two&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom." Kyla interrupted her mother. "Martin Weiss and I won't have any future together. I'll make it clear to him when he&rsquo;s discharged from the hospital. He&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with me. He&rsquo;ll just be the father of the kids.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was instantly surprised at that. "How could it be... You said the other day..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was something I said in the spur of the moment. He injured himself to save me, so I just mistook gratitude for affection. But I've been carefully thinking about it these days. We're not a right fit for each other. Being together with him will only make me think of all the pain from the past. I can't get over it!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn looked at her daughter with a sorry look. "You haven&rsquo;t been able to get over it after all these years?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I can't get over it, so... I suppose it&rsquo;ll be best to separate from him," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you've made up your mind, I&rsquo;ll support you no matter what. I&rsquo;ll continue to accompany you and raise your two children with you!" said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked gratefully at her mother. Without her, she would not have made it to this day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She owed her mother a great debt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla lay in bed at night, gently caressing her already bulging belly. Only she knew that what she had said to her mother today was just an excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had moved on from the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, she and Martin Weiss were still not right for each other! Her feelings for him were too insignificant. They were so insignificant... it was as though she could take them back at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss loved her so deeply that he did not care about himself.</p></div>
