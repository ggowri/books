        <h1>Chapter 4147</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why would they suddenly want me to audition?" Kit asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "How would I know? Maybe when the time comes, you can ask the director. Perhaps someone recommended you, or maybe the director saw some of your photos and performances and felt you were a good fit for the role," the agent said. "Anyway, this is a huge opportunity, so make sure to seize it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I understand," Kit said, ending the call with his agent, his mind filled with questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A few days later, Kit arrived at the audition venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In the past few days, he had studied the audition script, so the audition was not difficult for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But what surprised him was that after his audition, the director immediately announced that he would be cast as the male lead, and even offered him a very good salary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Furthermore, the director mentioned that if there were no issues, he could sign the contract right away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He knew very well that it was rare for things to progress so quickly, with the offer of a contract right from the start.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Unless the director had been very clear from the beginning that he wanted him as the male lead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, when it comes to acting, he's still considered a newcomer. Why would they choose someone like him for such a high-budget production?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What's wrong? Are you unsatisfied with the pay or do you have other demands?" The director asked when Kit didn't reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Of course not!" The agent quickly answered on Kit's behalf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Alright, you can take a look at the specific contract. If you agree, we can sign it immediately," the other party said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After signing the contract, as Kit and his agent walked out of the signing meeting room, Kit felt a surreal sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'll go to the restroom first. Wait for me," the agent said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After the agent left, Kit leaned against the corner of the wall, trying to calm down his bewildered emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just then, he suddenly heard someone saying, "Have you heard? The male lead has been chosen, and it's Kit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You mean that idol star? He just finished filming a TV drama, but he was only a supporting role. The drama hasn't even aired yet! Why would they choose someone like him as the lead? Just because he's good-looking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No, it's because of the Stephenson family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "The Stephenson family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "The White Maple Group suddenly made a big investment, but their requirement was for Kit to be the male lead. Today, Kit was just auditioning as a formality."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What's the connection between the White Maple Group and Kit?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Isn't it because of Miss. Stephenson? They were even in gossip news together before! Maybe Kit has already slept with Miss. Stephenson. This kind of thing is not uncommon in this industry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "That's true. But that guy Kit is really lucky. He actually managed to get the Stephenson family to invest so much money in him..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As the conversation between the two faded into the distance, Kit's expression gradually became serious against the other side of the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It turns out that the luck he thought he had was given to him by Tina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Yes, she's the Stephenson family's heiress. With just a word from her, she can provide him with resources! Resources that many people desperately desire but find difficult to obtain, yet for him, they come so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But why does he feel so heavy-hearted?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As if he's constantly falling into an abyss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In the next moment, Kit suddenly stepped away. The agent had just returned from the restroom and hurriedly caught up, saying, "Hey, didn't I ask you to wait for me? Where are you going?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "To meet the investor!" Kit said sarcastically with a smirk on his face.</p></div>
