        <h1>Chapter 1805</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina saw Nelson's nervousness and could not help sighing, "Okay, I won't tell your mommy. If those people talk about you like that again, call me. I can talk to your teacher and we&rsquo;ll see how we can stop this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson obediently replied, "Thank you, Aunt Lina!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina touched Nelson's head. The child was so sensible that it made people feel sorry for him sometimes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was only nine years old but was already burdened with more hardships than other children his age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Neither noticed Kyla at the door. She was leaning against the wall with tears welling in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It had occurred to her that Nelson would be discriminated against for his hearing disability, but the boy had never mentioned it to her. Hence, she always assumed that his classmates were not discriminating against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could spend his schooling days healthily and happily while learning like ordinary children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it seemed that it was wishful thinking after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'He should have been a healthy child! He doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be discriminated against.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I did this to him. It's my fault...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla only felt her heart throbbing with fits of pain...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Jason came to the He family&rsquo;s house. Archer Barlow and his wife wanted to inform all their neighbors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, due to Jason's cold gaze, Archer Barlow and his wife dared not do anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace found that the He family had reorganized Mason's room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, according to Veronica Barlow, Mason did not sleep in this room at night. Instead, he would come to her room and sleep with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I like to sleep with Sis," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Grace was ready to leave the He family&rsquo;s house, Veronica Barlow could not help asking, "aunt Cummins, can Mason still be my brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew that Mason would return to the Reed family one day. What she feared most was that Mason would no longer have anything to do with her after he left the He family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mason still had the surname He, and he was her younger brother. She and Mason were sister and brother, not people who had nothing to do with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sure," said Grace as she glanced at the nearby couple who were pretending to be good parents. Then, her eyes fell on Veronica Barlow. "Veronica, have you thought about my suggestion? You can move to the Reed family&rsquo;s house with Mason. The Reed family will cover all your living expenses and tuition fees. You don't need to worry about anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Veronica Barlow hesitated for a moment before shaking her head. "My... daddy's still here, and my mommy left me this house. I don't want to leave it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There were memories of her mother in this house. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At this moment when Grace was looking at Veronica Barlow, she thought of herself. "Okay then. Call me if you're in any trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you, aunt Cummins," said Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Back at Reed Residence, the two little ones had come back from kindergarten. When they saw Grace, Jasper rushed forward to kiss and hug her, saying she missed her mommy. Then, she asked her sweetly, "Do your hands still hurt? They&rsquo;ll stop hurting if I blow on them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As Jasper spoke, she leaned forward with her little head and blew on Grace's hands, making Grace's heart melt.</p></div>
