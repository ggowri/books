        <h1>Chapter 3611</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the conversation in the study, when Grace accompanied her daughter back to the room, </span><span>Jasper suddenly asked, "Mom, you... do you hate William's mother for what she did to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew something about the grudges of the previous generation as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace looked at her daughter. "I used to hate her, but so many years have passed, and besides, that person has already suffered the consequences and is dead. What's the point of holding onto hatred? It would only make oneself unhappy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper bit her lip slightly. "I know. Actually, William has always been concerned because his mother was the one who harmed you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, if you really want to be with him for a long time, you need to give him more reassurance," Grace said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Jasper paused for a moment, "Forever and ever?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or have you never considered being with him in the future?" Grace continued, "If your feelings for him are only those of a good friend, and not that of a lifelong companion, then I hope you can clarify things with William sooner rather than later. Sometimes, emotional harm can be more severe than other types of harm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper hesitated for a moment and asked, "Mom, how did you know you were in love with Dad back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, I found myself caring more and more about him. When I saw him sad and upset, I felt the same way. I wanted to do everything I could to heal his wounds," Grace said, thinking about her past with Jason, a slight smile forming on her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite all the obstacles and hardships they faced, she was glad she persevered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In any case, ask yourself this: if one day he isn't by your side anymore and he falls in love with another woman, considering her the most important person in his life instead of you, could you accept that?" Grace said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper frowned, feeling uncomfortable at the thought of another woman appearing in William's life in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, take your time to think it through," Grace ruffled her daughter's hair. "But regardless of whether you choose William in the end or not, Mommy will support whatever decision you make based on your own feelings. It's all up to your heart, don't worry about anything else."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Grace left the room, Jasper pondered over the words her mother had just said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the years, she had grown accustomed to William's presence. Even when they were separated by long distances in different cities, they would video call or chat online every day, as if he were right beside her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On this evening, Jasper had a dream. In the dream, he saw a beautiful girl beside William. He and the beautiful girl were together, and his smile belonged to her from then on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was fixed solely on the girl, no matter how much she called out to him, he never looked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jasper woke up from the dream, his pillow was wet, and there were still traces of tears in the corners of his eyes.</span></p></div>
