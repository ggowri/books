        <h1>Chapter 4050</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A few minutes is enough for one hairstyle. Sometimes, there are several hairstyles in a few minutes," Mick said. "At the beginning, I didn't learn too many hairstyles because I was afraid of getting confused. So, learning one hairstyle a day was enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy blinked again, "So, how many hairstyles have you learned now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've learned about a dozen hairstyles in half a month," Mick modestly replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy swallowed the saliva suddenly secreted in her throat, "Can you really learn a hairstyle in just a few minutes every day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why not? It's not that difficult," he replied with a matter-of-fact attitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Nancy suddenly didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had also watched online videos teaching braiding, but usually, it was easy to understand while watching, but it was a completely different story when trying it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's why many people joked that they had learned with their eyes, but not with their hands!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, from the level of braiding he had just done for her, he must have learned with both his eyes and hands!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your hands are so amazing," Nancy exclaimed, looking at Mick's hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His fingers were slender, fair, and quite attractive. With good maintenance, even his nails gave off a delicate feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Such hands were like those of an artist, especially when he held a cigarette between his long fingers. The smoke drifting away had an indescribable charm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she had not seen him smoke since they reunited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she asked him about it, he simply said, "I quit," in a calm tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, those hands could even braid hair, which was a bit unexpected but made Nancy feel warm inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This man was the right choice for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Nancy and Mick returned to the Reed family, Mason's family, Jasper, and William were all there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had a meal together and chatted about daily life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Nancy and Mick were newlyweds, they had lived in the Reed family mansion for several months and had become familiar with everyone. Therefore, the conversation was casual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they chatted, they brought up Chandler and Tina's topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Speaking of which, Chandler has to wait for Tina to graduate before they can get married. Tina is only a sophomore now, so Chandler has to wait for at least two or three more years. He'll be 30 by then," Jasper said. "I thought my brother would get married later than Chandler. Poor Chandler, but who asked Tina to be so young."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During Nancy's hospitalization, the Stephenson family of three also came to visit her, so Nancy had a good impression of Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The tall man standing next to Tina on the wedding day was Chandler, right?" Nancy recalled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, on the day of the wedding banquet, she met too many people, so she was afraid of confusing them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it's that tall one with a slightly feminine appearance, but very beautiful!" Jasper enthusiastically added, "Tina has boasted about Chandler's looks countless times!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's quite beautiful," Nancy recalled and nodded in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A man using the word "beautiful" to describe someone's appearance without sounding awkward shows that Chandler's looks are indeed pleasing to the eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right, Tina used to encourage Chandler to participate in some idol talent shows, hoping he could make his debut," Jasper joked.</p></div>
