        <h1>Chapter 3773</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mezera's gaze finally fell on Veronica standing next to Mason. In her opinion, Veronica looked very ordinary, wearing cheap clothes and not particularly beautiful. This kind of woman could be found everywhere on campus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But just now, Mason was cold towards her, but his attitude towards that woman was obviously much gentler. This comparison made her even more uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the two about to leave, Mezera suddenly said, "Senior, are you refusing my kindness to go to the campus festival with this woman? I wonder what the relationship between her and you is? But I guess this woman is not your girlfriend, after all, your girlfriend couldn't be so ordinary-looking, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Mezera's view, since Mason made her lose face, she wouldn't let him off easily. Mason was the Reed family's Mason, and she couldn't directly oppose him, but she could use the woman next to him to attack him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason paused and turned his head to look at Mezera coldly, "I don't need you to </span><span>evaluate what kind of person my girlfriend is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's words made some of the onlookers gasp in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mezera was even more stunned and exclaimed, "How is that possible! How could she be your girlfriend?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words just now were just meant to deliberately attack the woman and create a rift between her and Mason, but she didn't expect Mason to answer like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This kind of person?" Mason's voice became even colder, "Then what kind of person are you? Do you think you're superior to her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mezera did feel superior, but she couldn't say that to someone like Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I just thought that you two didn't really...look like a couple. If Mr. Reed said she was your girlfriend just to save face after what I said, then I apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need," Mason said. "You don't have the right to make that call. Let me handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mezera's face turned red at his words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, you mentioned that your father is the chairman of Ladd Group, right? I remember that," Mason said before taking Veronica and leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mezera stood there, her face now pale instead of red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Remember? Remember who her father is?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cold tone made her feel like he wanted to destroy her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe...her actions today would bring endless trouble to the Ladd Family. Mezera suddenly had a premonition in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If possible, she hoped that this premonition would never come true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica followed Mason towards the school gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you angry?" Veronica couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I'm angry?" Mason asked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, I think so," she said. "Of course, if I'm wrong, then I apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you apologizing?" Mason abruptly stopped and turned to Veronica. "Even if I'm really angry, it's not you who should apologize. It's not you who made me angry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it because of what your classmate said earlier?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason pursed his thin lips. He couldn't even explain his own emotions at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did he feel so uncomfortable and even want to hit someone when he heard someone belittling her?</span></p></div>
