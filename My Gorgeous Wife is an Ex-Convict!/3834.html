        <h1>Chapter 3832</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Speaking of which, this was also her childhood regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she wanted to dress him up like a doll, but he never agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason felt a headache coming on when he heard this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But back then, you were pretty and cute. Now, although you're still cute..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica didn't finish her sentence before Mason interrupted her. "I don't think I'm cute at all now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're very cute, especially with your blushing face. It makes me feel like I want to take care of you like a big sister!" Veronica said, planting several kisses on Mason's rosy cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Veronica still wanting more, Mason held her face and said, "Do you know how easily that sentence you just said can be misunderstood?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This sentence could easily lead to misunderstandings, but he didn't say it out loud.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Misunderstanding? Did I cause you any misunderstandings?" Veronica blinked and said, "But I don't think there's anything to misunderstand. Your current appearance is really attractive, and it's only natural for me to be attracted to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh my god, her words were like a catalyst to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Mason only wanted to push the person in front of him down and kiss her fiercely, making her understand the consequences of teasing him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a voice suddenly sounded, "Oops, did we interrupt you guys?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica turned her head and saw Jasper and William standing at the door of the ward. William's expression was normal, but Jasper was staring with great interest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Huh?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica only realized afterwards that her and Mason's posture at the moment was incredibly ambiguous!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both of them were holding each other's faces, and it seemed like they were about to kiss in the next second!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"N-no, you misunderstood!" Veronica quickly let go and explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason then slowly let go of her, but unlike Veronica's flustered expression, Mason looked as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, what do you think I misunderstood?" Jasper asked with a burning gaze, innocent yet cunning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Well, now it was Veronica's turn to blush and feel at a loss for how to answer Jasper's question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason spoke up, "Alright, what are you here for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I'm here to see you. Mommy also asked me to tell you that the police will officially prosecute Daniel next week. You and Veronica will need to testify in court, of course..." Jasper smiled at Veronica, "Mommy said if Veronica doesn't want to testify, she can apply not to attend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the operating procedures at that time will be a bit troublesome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I'll go to court!" Veronica said, "I am the main victim and witness, it is only natural for me to go to court!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Veronica, will you be okay if you do that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about me, I'm just going to court to testify against a killer!" Veronica reassured Jasper, who was worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, anyway, Mommy will come to the hospital with Daddy tonight, so you can just tell Mommy when the time comes, Veronica." Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Veronica agreed.</span></p></div>
