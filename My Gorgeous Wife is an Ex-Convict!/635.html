        <h1>Chapter 634</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He carefully prepared the food and fed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If anyone who knew Jason saw this, their jaw would drop. After all, when did Young Master Reed ever wait on someone like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This scene naturally became an attraction in the bar without them knowing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was already late in the evening and the bar was getting more and more crowded. Naturally, a lot of people were looking in the direction of Jason and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Jason was extremely good-looking. In a place like a bar, he was the number one choice for many women to flirt with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason was feeding Grace so carefully, many women were starting to fall for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nothing could feel better than to be fed by such a man who looked at you like you were his treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, even though Jason had Grace by his side, many women were still itching to give it a shot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, in a place like a bar, many things could be made possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, a gorgeous woman in a tight dress came forward. She smiled at Jason and said, "Can I sit here for a while? I'm alone today." As she spoke, she gave Jason a wink. She only found him more handsome up close than from a distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was a man like this, she would be willing even if it was only a one-night stand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason frowned in disgust and said coldly, "No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman's expression froze. She thought she was much better looking than the woman next to him who seemed a little drunk. Did he not see her face?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the woman got even closer to Jason. "Is this woman your friend? She looks like the boring kind. If you'd like to be with me tonight, I'm sure you'll find me interesting. I'll even let you... Do whatever you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman's words were full of hints.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyes coldly. There was a flicker of anger in his dark amorous eyes. He did not like being interrupted when he was with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Interesting?" His cold voice gave her goosebumps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman stiffened and felt a chill running down her spine. Maybe... She should not have flirted with him today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even had the illusion that he was looking at her as if he were looking at a dead person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you..." Jason had barely finished his sentence when suddenly another voice rang out and interrupted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who&hellip; Is she, Jay?" Having swallowed her food, Grace's gaze fell on the woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A stranger," Jason said softly, "Come on, do you want more food?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gentle tone now was a sharp contrast to the cold voice he had used on the woman earlier. It frightened her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace grunted, shook her head, and stood up shakily. However, instead of looking at Jason, she turned to the woman in front of her and said, "Let&hellip; Let me tell you, Jay&hellip; Jason is mine. You can&rsquo;t have any funny ideas!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Come on, even if I had some funny ideas, I no longer have any!'</p></div>
