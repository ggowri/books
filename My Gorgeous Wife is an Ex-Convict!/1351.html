        <h1>Chapter 1350</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace accompanied Kyla Corbyn to the hospital and queued for registration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn did not look very well. While they were queuing, Grace said, "Kyla, what Aunt said about asking the person who received your bone marrow to donate you their liver might work."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn forced a smile. "Why do you have the same idea as my mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"After all, a liver transplant is the only viable way for you to stay alive," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn sighed, "It's out of the question. My mother has already secretly called the hospital to find the person I donated my bone marrow to and told the hospital about my situation. The hospital helped her contact them. They called back a few days ago, saying they refuse to donate their liver."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was instantly surprised. "How could it be?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why couldn&rsquo;t it be?" Kyla Corbyn was calm about it. "They're not related to me. They don't have to risk their life for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips together tightly and suddenly said, "But what if it was Martin Weiss? What if it had been Martin Weiss who received your bone marrow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn froze and stared blankly at Grace. After a good while, she said, "Martin Weiss? Grace, what are you talking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sighed and told Kyla Corbyn about Jason's investigation. Then, she said, "So, I suspect that the person who received your bone marrow donation was actually Martin Weiss. As for Paisley Daniels, she probably didn't donate her bone marrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn seemed to have heard a bizarre story. For the first time, she learned that Martin Weiss, she, and Paisley Daniels all had the same rare blood type. They were all compatible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The odds were too low!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was it Martin Weiss whom I saved?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought of the details the doctor had given her on the phone. It was a young man several years older than her. He was an only child from the same city as her and therefore, he was given high expectations by his family...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These were simple details she did not think much of at first. After all, many people would fit the description.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Now that she applied them to Martin Weiss, they fit exactly...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it possible? Could the truth be that ridiculous? Was the person I saved the one who hated me so much he put me in prison?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn just found it absurd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla?" Grace could not resist breaking the silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn gave a wry smile emotionally. "Even if Martin Weiss was indeed the recipient, he and I have a family feud. He only deliberately approached me to make me fall in love with him and even testified to get me into prison in the end. All these were just part of his revenge. How could he risk giving me his liver?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, the hospital has said that the recipient refuses to donate their liver." Kyla Corbyn paused a little before saying, "Also, many of these things are only your speculations. You have no real evidence. I would only make a fool of myself and get ridiculed if I told Martin Weiss about it and asked him to donate me his liver."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just wanted to retain her last ounce of dignity now. Even if she was going to die, she wanted nothing to do with that man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent. It seemed they had to find strong evidence, after all!</p></div>
