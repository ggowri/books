        <h1>Chapter 1492</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason clenched his teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed was the one who raised him, so he naturally knew him best. The old master knew he was suspicious by nature and would be uneasy whenever Grace was involved. Therefore, he ordered Secretary Wang to disappear for some time before appearing again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This way, Jason would want to see Secretary Wang in person as he would only feel at ease after personally questioning him! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Even when Grandpa&rsquo;s dead, he still wants to do this to me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How is Grandpa going to bet whether I'll give up my life for a woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Nothing must happen to... Grace!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace woke up, she was in a car with one hand firmly bound to the steering wheel while the other was bound to the handbrake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car was parked on the cliff. The back of it was hanging off the cliff, leaving only the front on land. Things looked extremely dangerous. The entire car might just fall off the cliff with the slightest movement inside the car or an external force. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The sea was right below the cliff!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace&rsquo;s body stiffened. She was too afraid to move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In front of her was a phone, and Lily was looking right at her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They were both on a video call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, you're awake!" Lily smiled darkly. "Speaking of which, I didn't expect that the person I used to trample on could one day become the Reed family's mistress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lily, what are you trying to do?" said Grace as she tried hard to suppress her unease and fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All she remembered was that she had been in the bedroom when she suddenly felt a little dizzy, so she decided to lie down and rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, she woke up like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'So it was not sleepiness but something else? Was I... kidnapped by Lily?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But how? How did Lily get me out of Reed Residence when Jay has arranged so many bodyguards to protect me and enhanced the security?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A series of questions flashed through Grace's mind, but now was not the time to think about them. She should be thinking about how to get out of this situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily answered Grace through the video call, "I want to see what will happen to you! Grace, since you were the one who got me into such a mess, it's not going to end well for you either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why don't we see how much Jason loves you and whether he&rsquo;ll give up his life for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Also, there are bombs all around your car. If anyone rushes over to save you, they'll not only get blown up but you and the three babies in your belly will also be blown into the sea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Every word Lily said made Grace's heart sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily was trying to kill her!</p></div>
