        <h1>Chapter 1466</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was silent and did not say a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn said, "Whatever it is, don't hurt Grace if you care about Grace and love her deeply."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyelashes fluttered a little. A long time passed before he said, "The last thing I want is to hurt her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian walked into the ward and saw Grace in hospital clothes. She was half-sitting on the hospital bed. She still did not look good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sorry," he said. He had never thought of letting her find out about the truth in such a way. She had almost miscarried and was even hospitalized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had planned to keep the truth to himself and have Lily imprisoned and punished in other ways.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, most of the time, things would not work out as planned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just like back then... He had wanted to be with her, but he did not trust her when she needed help most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had pushed her to Jason himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now, it was useless even if he held countless regrets in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "You have nothing to apologize for. I just want to see the contents of the email that Old Master Reed sent you. I hope you can forward a copy of that to me if possible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian seemed somewhat surprised. "You want to see the email?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Can I?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He bit his lower lip lightly. "Sure. But your health..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know my health well. I'll keep my emotions in check," she said. She deserved to know about the truth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Everyone else now knew about the truth, but she was the only one kept in the dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian pulled out his phone and forwarded the anonymous email he had received to the email address Grace provided.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After doing this, Brian said, "Grace, I don't know what will happen next, but... if you need my help one day, just ask. My phone number will never change. I can help you with anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would do anything for her if she asked!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace shook her head. "Brian, I told you to get over me. Now, I'm still going to say the same thing. You should get over some things, or you'll be stuck in the past forever. You&rsquo;ll only end up wasting your feelings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian smiled wryly. 'Get over?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was easy to say those two words but difficult to actually do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could not nor did he want to get over her. He was willing to stay stuck in the past even though it was a waste of his feelings and his feelings would never be reciprocated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He... was still reluctant to get over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian left, and Grace asked the medical staff looking after her to ask Jason for her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, she had been rushed into the hospital due to an emergency. She did not have her phone with her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Half an hour later, the medical staff gave her the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When handing her the phone, the medical staff whispered to her, "Mrs. Reed, Mr. Reed is still outside the ward. Do you want him to come in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No," she said. Perhaps she was not yet ready to see him.</p></div>
