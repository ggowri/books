        <h1>Chapter 1494</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Using his mouth, Secretary Wang signaled in the direction of Grace's car that was about 20 meters away. He said, "There's a device over there. It's the device that can defuse these bombs. But only your fingerprint can disarm the device, Young Master."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As Secretary Wang spoke, the smile on his bruised face became more obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason naturally would not believe that everything was so simple!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang would not have gone to so much trouble if saving Grace was going to be so simple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Spit everything out at once! Don't test my patience. I have no time to waste here with you!" snapped Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With Grace's current situation, the longer they delay it, the more dangerous it would be!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's just that after you disarm those bombs, the device will detonate itself at the same time. In other words, you'll save Grace but kill yourself at the same time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang's voice was not low as he deliberately tried to let Grace hear him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sure enough, when Grace heard this, her heart suddenly sank. She felt chills all over her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not expect that her survival would be on the condition that Jay sacrificed his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why... Why would this person devise such a plan? If he just wanted me to die, wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier if he had asked Lily to do it when I was unconscious?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next moment, Secretary Wang gave Grace the answer. "Old Master set this up so that you can think clearly about whether it's worth risking your life for this woman. You can find another one even if this woman is gone. If you like her looks, you can find one who looks the same as her. It's no big deal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, with all the advances in plastic surgery, it was possible to recreate a face even if Jason could not find another woman who looked like Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace never expected that the real person behind this was Old Master Reed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew that the old master had never liked her being with Jay. Even after she got pregnant, the old master still did not accept her. Even so, she never thought that the old master would hate her to such an extent that he would make such a bet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was to bet whether Jay would kill himself for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"By the way, may I remind you, Young Master, that the bombs&rsquo; triggers are sensitive and will automatically go off when there are five or more people nearby. We probably only have 15 minutes left before the explosion. Young Master, you need to quickly make a decision! Otherwise, when the time comes, the bombs buried all around the car will automatically explode even if no one steps on them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Everyone was surprised when he said that, and Jason's face was even grimmer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'15 minutes! Only 15 minutes? And it's unclear whether what Secretary Wang is saying is true or false.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was Terrence who was the first to calm down. He quickly asked one of the bodyguards who had been in the special forces to check whether disarming the bombs would also make the device itself detonate, just as Secretary Wang said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a brief review, the man concluded, "Yes, the other side will explode immediately after one side deactivates the bombs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang added with a smile, "Although the explosion will create a strong impact, Grace won&rsquo;t fall into the sea and can save herself if she steps on the accelerator and drives ahead the moment of the explosion. However, Young Master won&rsquo;t survive the explosion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's face was dark, and he said nothing.</p></div>
