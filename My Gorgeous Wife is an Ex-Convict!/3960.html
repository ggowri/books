        <h1>Chapter 3958</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When will she wake up?" Mick's voice echoed in the hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um... she should wake up in a few hours at the latest," the doctor replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And how many hours exactly?" the icy voice carried a hint of displeasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It shouldn't be more than five hours. She'll wake up within five hours," the doctor answered cautiously, heart pounding like thunder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this was someone he couldn't afford to offend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the medical staff left, Mick sat by Nancy's bedside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked like a fragile object in her coma, making him feel heartbroken.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, heartbroken!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was heartbroken for this woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick's eyelashes trembled slightly as he gently stroked her pale cheek, "Nancy, I think I might really like you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I rushed to the hospital as soon as I heard about her accident because I like her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>My worry for her is also because of my feelings for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time was passing by second by second, but every minute felt like torture for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Nancy woke up, Mick's subordinates had already submitted all the information about the car accident to him in writing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This information was more detailed than what the police and Mick were previously told.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It even clearly stated when Nancy entered and left the Schultz family, and that Clarissa drove out of the Schultz family five minutes after Nancy left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result of the accident, Clarissa's car hit Nancy, who fell into a coma. Clarissa was unharmed, so after making a statement at the police station, the Schultz family paid bail and returned home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find a lawyer to invalidate Clarissa's bail and have her detained," Mick instructed his subordinates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was still lying in the hospital bed, so how could the person who hit her be allowed to be out on bail at home?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did the accident really happen as Clarissa stated in her statement, that Nancy suddenly ran out? Or was there another reason?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter what, he didn't want to let the person who hurt her get away with it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he was very clear that he would not allow anyone else to harm this woman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Nancy woke up, it was already dark outside, and the hospital room was only lit by a dim yellow light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she saw was a strange ceiling and... Mick's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...how..." she murmured, but was interrupted by the other person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're awake. Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere?" he asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It hurts..." she instinctively said, raising her hand to touch her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He quickly held her hand gently. "Don't scratch. You have bandages on your head. I'll call the doctor to check on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Mick pressed the call button.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, medical staff came to the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After examining Nancy, the doctor confirmed that there was no major problem, but she could only drink a small amount of water for now. She could only have some liquid food after another 6 hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She also had many bruises, abrasions, and sprains on her body, which needed to be treated with medicine every day. It would take some time for her to recover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the medical staff left, Mick turned to look at the person lying on the bed, only to find her staring at him stupidly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened in the car accident?" Mick asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just wanted to hear the truth from her own mouth.</span></p></div>
