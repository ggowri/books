        <h1>Chapter 2787</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Someone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's inappropriate for me to help you change your clothes, so I found a maid to do it," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller breathed a sigh of relief and secretly laughed at herself for overthinking. 'Of course, Brian would ask the servant to help me change my clothes. After all, that&rsquo;s the most reasonable thing to do.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't say or do anything inappropriate after I got drunk yesterday, did I?" she asked after hesitating slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For some reason, he thought of last night's kiss before looking away and saying, "No, you didn't do anything inappropriate." Since they were a couple, it was natural for them to kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I'll go out first. You can come down for breakfast when you're ready," Brian said and walked out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was the only one left in the huge room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller began looking around the unfamiliar room. This room alone looked as large as her small apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was amazed as she staggered up and picked up the clothes Brian had prepared for her. After taking a look at them, she found that these clothes were all luxury brands. She figured the clothes would add up to 200,000 or 300,000 dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt like they were worlds apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... even if they were worlds apart, she still wanted to get close to him and make this relationship work. No matter what happened in the end, at least she gave it her best and would not regret it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller changed her clothes after washing up and bathing. Then, she saw a long corridor after opening the door. There were stairs on both sides. She chose the one near her side and walked downstairs. She saw a servant coming up and saying, "Miss Theller, please follow me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller followed the servant to the dining room, where she saw Brian sitting at one end of the table, eating breakfast gracefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The servant pulled out the chair on Brian's left-hand side and served breakfast to Valda Theller after she sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller ate her breakfast as she glanced at Brian out the corners of her eyes. Eating breakfast with him like this made her feel like they were newlyweds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh, what am I thinking? Brian hasn't fallen for me, yet I'm thinking about such things!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller blushed and hurriedly buried herself in her breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take your time. Don't choke," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay..." she answered in a mumble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And what was on your mind when you looked at me? Why did your face turn red suddenly?" he said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She almost spat out the porridge in her mouth. It turned out that he had noticed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I just feel a little... embarrassed after looking at you too long," she said awkwardly as she blushed more. She could not tell him she thought they were like newlyweds, could she?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to be embarrassed. Since we're dating, you can look at me as long as you want," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His tone was as flat as if he was only saying something common, but it melted her heart. The embarrassment earlier seemed to slowly fade as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he looked cold and indifferent, he had always given her a warm feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It must be a happy thing to be loved by someone like him.</p></div>
