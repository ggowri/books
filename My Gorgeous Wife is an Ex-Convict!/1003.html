        <h1>Chapter 1002</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his eyebrows slightly. "What's the matter? Are you afraid that I'd rather believe others than you, just like Martin Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll never forgive you if that happens. I'll forget you and love another man..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she finished speaking, he leaned forward and grabbed her jaw to kiss her on the lips so that her voice was drowned out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This domineering kiss showed absolute possession.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina struggled a little at first, but she gradually caved in. Both her hands were wrapped around Hadwin Stephenson's neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss was over, she gasped for air with her cheeks flushing red. Her round eyes were so seductive right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can never forget me and love another man," he whispered, his hoarse voice sounding so determined. 'Does she know the way she looks right now is the most seductive and captivating to me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why can't I forget you and love another man?" she asked stubbornly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, his lips were on hers again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Alright, it does feel good to be kissed by him,' thought Lina as she could not help indulging in the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea how many times he kissed her until she felt her lips burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now, can you still forget me and fall in love with another man?" he asked as he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was rendered speechless. She covered her lips and could not speak. He would probably kiss her again if she talked back to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Although it's nice to kiss him and his skills are... uh, pretty good, I can't stand that much kissing. We must&rsquo;ve been kissing&hellip; for over half an hour.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw that she was silent, he raised his hand and touched her head. "Alright, let's not talk about things like that again. Didn't we already make a deal when we first started dating? We'll never break up. We'll be together for the rest of our lives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina bit her lip. "I'm just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know you're worried that I'll turn out like Martin Weiss and trust others rather than you. However... Lina, I'm not Martin Weiss, and you're not Kyla Corbyn. Our future is different from theirs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson fixed his gaze on the person in front of him and said, "Therefore, shouldn't you have a little more trust in me? You should believe that you're the only woman I&rsquo;ll love. There will be no other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes. She's the only one!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It took little time to fall in love with her. He fell head over heels for her in those days they spent together abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It took him another three years to understand how deep was his love for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so deep that the usually revengeful him forgave her so easily. He was content just by seeing her. Even when she was just beside him, he could not help fearing that she would suddenly disappear as she had done before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson muttered, "Lina, do you understand how much I love you? I love you so much that it's scary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at him. She could feel her heart beating stronger and stronger&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn took a letter from her mother after putting her son to sleep. The words &lsquo;XX Court&rsquo; on the letter made her heart sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn felt a chill running through her body as she tore open the letter and read its contents.</p></div>
