        <h1>Chapter 1614</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss sat in the car as he watched his son come back from school. He watched Kyla give Nelson a gentle smile. She had smiled at him like that once, but he had ruined everything himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was almost overwhelmed with regret at the thought of her gentleness and love for him back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The more he loved her, the more painful it was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss just stayed in the car. Even when it was getting dark, he was still reluctant to leave. He wanted to stay here longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not until the store's lights went out that he finally looked down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Has another day gone by?' Every day that passed was now torture for him. It was the pain of not being able to get what he wanted. It had only been five years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">How long would he live his life like this? Even his flesh and blood would not call him &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo; anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With a wry smile, Martin Weiss prepared to start the car when he suddenly trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because he saw the figure he had been longing for walking out of the store and heading in his direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The yellow light of the street lamp fell on her, making the scene peaceful and beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was thin and wearing a plain dress. Her bare face looked a little sickly. Even though the liver transplant that year was successful and saved her life, her health was badly affected. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had no idea how many years it would take to nurse her back to health.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss thought of how she had returned the supplements he previously sent her and a burst of gloom surged in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla was getting closer to Martin Weiss's car, making him more and more nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it a coincidence? She probably just happens to be heading this way.' His reason told him. After all, he was probably the last person she wanted to see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, another voice asked what coincidence could there be? It was late, and the shops nearby were closed. Where else would she go?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Finally, when she stopped in front of his car and stared at him through the windshield with those eyes that had suffered years of hardship, Martin Weiss began trembling violently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She's looking at me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She... really came for me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How long has she not looked at me like this? Is she...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His hands almost trembled as he unbuckled the seat belt he had just buckled. He opened the door and staggered out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Qian... Kyla..." Martin Weiss was almost at a loss as he met Kyla's eyes, not knowing what to do or say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps his temper had grown colder after all he had been through over the years. Only when he faced her and her son would he feel so confused, nervous, and afraid.</p></div>
