        <h1>Chapter 759</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he was convinced that she was not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Somehow an uncomfortable feeling came over her. She thought perhaps it was because he was the first friend she had ever gone through thick and thin with as a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she had lived in this small town for several years, she always felt a sense of estrangement from the children in town.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the dream, she did not feel that the little girl had any sense of estrangement from the little boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, I won't come here again," said Grace as she stepped back. However, she stepped on a branch, lost her footing, and leaned backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" exclaimed Grace, feeling herself falling over the edge of the cliff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll fall!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hands almost instinctively tried to grab something! 'Whatever it is!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, a hand caught her hand. She was so close to the cliff that if he had not caught her, she would have fallen all the way down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was lying on the edge of the cliff, clutching her wrist with one hand. "Give... Me the other hand. I'll pull you up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face was pale, and there was a look of rare consternation in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's almond-shaped eyes met Brian's phoenix eyes. Then, it felt as if they had switched places.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm the one who fell, and I'm the one who should be panicking!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... He was the one panicking now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Quick, give me your other hand too!" He urged with difficulty. His other hand reached toward her hand desperately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace raised her other hand and reached for Brian's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their hands... Were getting closer and closer, but just then, images flashed through her mind. Grace's head began to hurt again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop... Hurting&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She exclaimed from the bottom of her heart, 'This is no time for a headache!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With one careless mistake, she might fall off the cliff!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the more she thought of it, the worse her headache seemed to grow!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The&hellip; The pain was so bad that she could not even give her other hand to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, what&rsquo;s going on? What are you doing?!" shouted Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the pain in her head was getting worse and worse. It was so bad that she could hardly see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried to raise her head, but she could not see his face at all. All she could hear was his anxious roar&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace! Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even the roar seemed to grow fainter and fainter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, she felt as if she was being swallowed up in darkness... The scenes were getting clearer and clearer. It was as if something was flooding into her mind...</p></div>
