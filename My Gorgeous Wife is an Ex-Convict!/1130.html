        <h1>Chapter 1129</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's heart was filled with hatred, but she managed to squeeze out a smile. "Of... Of course, I know. By the way, Grace is here too. I asked her to wait for me in the lounge. It's... not my turn yet, so I'll go find her first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Stella made a gesture to head for the lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's here too?" Brian was shocked and immediately followed Stella. "Let's go over together." He wanted to see Grace. He missed her insanely whenever he did not see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he were not afraid that his intense pursuit would annoy or scare her, he would go and see her every day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had not seen her in days, hoping she could sort out her feelings, and almost every day, he refrained himself from seeing her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was delighted. Sure enough, everything was going according to her plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace would be finished once everyone present was ushered to the door and she pushed the lounge door open while shouting in deliberate surprise!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as they were about to reach the lounge door, suddenly there was the sound of an ambulance near the mall&rsquo;s entrance. Then, there were paramedics carrying a stretcher hurrying toward this side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The paramedics shouted as they ran, "Make way, make way! Where's the patient who was drugged?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was dumbfounded. 'What's going on? Who called the paramedics?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she knew it, another policeman pushed his way through the crowd outside. "Someone called the police about someone being drugged here. The informant's name is Grace. Do you know where she is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace called the police?' Stella was petrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Brian heard the police calling Grace's name, he became nervous and asked Stella, "Where's Grace? Which lounge did you say you were heading to find her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's... It's this one..." Startled by the panicked expression on Brian's face, Stella unconsciously pointed her finger to the lounge not far away. Her mind was almost blank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's going on here? Why did the ambulance and police come?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Leaving Stella behind, Brian ran to the lounge and pushed open the door. Then, as if in a trance, he stood straight at the doorway, his phoenix eyes looking inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella finally came to herself and was delighted when she saw that Brian was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian must be shocked. Did he see Grace and Robert Brewer performing an unsightly scene?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace is finished!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pretending to be anxious, Stella deliberately turned her volume up and asked, "Brian, what's the matter? What happened? Did something happen to Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The arrival of the police and the ambulance was already eye-catching enough, coupled with Stella's shouting, more people immediately rushed over. Even the ongoing filming had come to a halt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Stella ran to the lounge door, she was stunned!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a far cry from what she had expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Robert Brewer and Grace were indeed in the lounge, but Robert Brewer's hands were tied with a white string. He was rolling on the ground as he made some noise. Meanwhile, Grace was sitting on a chair, fully clothed.</p></div>
