        <h1>Chapter 305</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"... No," Lina said, but she could guess why Jason came to her. It was probably because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If not, why did he come looking for you so late at night?" Hadwin said coolly. "What woman in Emerald City can make him do that? Or was it because of him that you didn't come looking for me all these years?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a faint hint of jealousy in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was speechless. Come on, if only she was up to Jason's standards! Jason was after Grace, all right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It has nothing to do with him. I just never looked for you," Lina said. Too many things had happened since she came back. How could she have time to think of anything else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she only regarded it as a foreign encounter and their night as an accident. She planned to keep this secret for the rest of her life. She did not even tell her parents and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked angrier than ever. He glared at her fiercely while he pressed his thin lips together, and at last, all he said was, "You have a way of pissing people off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was good at controlling his emotions since he was little. As he was born out of wedlock, he had always known to endure his joys and sorrows before he was certain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was the only one who seemed to particularly affect his emotions. He seemed to be able to completely release his emotions in front of her and did not need to have any burden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The few days they spent together were both sweet and painful for him. He would often think of them in his spare time over the three years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The happier those days were, the more painful it was when she left without saying goodbye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a knock on the door. Hadwin gathered himself. "Come in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone pushed through the door and came in. It was the guard outside, and behind him were Jason and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's eyes lit up when she saw her best friend. "Grace." She did not expect her best friend to come here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Grace immediately ran to Lina, nervously saying, "How are you feeling? What happened? Are you all right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm all right. I'm fine!" Lina hurriedly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was relieved. "Why did, uh, this man bring you here? Do you know him?" She could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina smiled awkwardly. "That's... a long story." Then, as if she thought of something, she suddenly said, "By the way, did you tell my parents about me being taken away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not yet, but... I called the police," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm screwed. The police will probably call my parents," Lina wailed and was in a hurry to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would probably have to deal with her parents' crying and screaming if she went back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a hand was in her way. "Did I say you can leave?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was shocked while Grace lunged forward, protectively shielding her best friend behind her."You have no right to detain anyone, and I've called the police. If you don't want any trouble, you'd better let Lina go."</p></div>
