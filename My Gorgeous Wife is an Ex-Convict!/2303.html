        <h1>Chapter 2301</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After rinsing his hand with water for about 20 minutes, Grace turned off the faucet when she figured the scalded spot had cooled down enough. She carefully dried Kyla's hand and asked, "Do you have any ointment here? You&rsquo;d better apply some, or you'll get blisters on your hand and it'll hurt badly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'll apply some later," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me help you apply it," said Grace. She asked where the medical kit was and found the ointment. After applying it to Kyla&rsquo;s hand, she finally felt slightly more at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I'm okay, and it's getting late. Why don't you go first?" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the time. It was almost time for her to go to the kindergarten and pick up her two children, so she said, "Okay, I'll leave. Make sure your hand doesn't come into contact with water for two hours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace left, Kyla stared blankly at the back of her red and swollen hand, her nose feeling sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had forced Martin Weiss to leave Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was young and ignorant, she thought that nothing could stop a couple as long as they loved each other!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she grew up, she learned that there were too many things in the world that would leave you helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Plop! Plop!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Droplets of water constantly fell on the back of her hand, which had just been applied with ointment. It was wet now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze for a moment before discovering that they were her tears. 'I&rsquo;m crying again! Is it because Martin Weiss left? Or... am I crying over how short-lived our love was?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tears streamed down as if they could not be stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She told herself not to cry. Crying too much was not good for the baby. She should not cry! Besides, her mother would be back from grocery shopping soon and Nelson would be back from school too...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her tears streamed down as if there was no end to them...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, Nelson was asleep, while Mrs. Corbyn looked at her daughter's red and swollen hand. She could not help but say, "You seem distracted these days. Why don't we close the store for a few days so you can have a good rest?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can we do that? If we close for a few days, someone else will steal our customers. It won't be easy to bring them back when we reopen," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, well..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Mrs. Corbyn spoke, there was the sound of thundering knocks on the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pair of mother and daughter looked at each other. After all, people usually would not come knocking at their door at this hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two walked to the door, and Kyla looked through the peephole. The person outside the door was Neal Reid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid knocked louder and louder, shouting, "Open the door. I have something important to say. Open the door. I'll leave after I finish speaking. I won't take much time..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla frowned and said through the door, "Mr. Wu, I already told you that I won't visit Jacqueline Bowman. She doesn't have to tell me anything. The court will make the ruling however they should!"</p></div>
