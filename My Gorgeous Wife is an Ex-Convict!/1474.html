        <h1>Chapter 1473</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was willing to do anything to get her forgiveness&mdash;anything but her leaving him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He did not care whether she was trying to escape from Reed Residence or him, but he still wanted to keep her trapped in Reed Residence. It was as though he believed she would not leave that way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that, Jason turned around and walked out of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Moments later, a caregiver walked in. It was the same caregiver who had been taking care of Grace at night these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mrs. Reed, Mr. Reed said to let you have a good rest. He won't come to the ward anymore. You don't need to worry about anything," the caregiver said. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was silent. She lay down on the bed and closed her eyes slowly, but her hands were caressing her belly. She was trying to keep her emotions from fluctuating too much and calm herself down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had to stay calm for the children&rsquo;s sake!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What should I do? Can I forget the pain and forget about how he had chosen to sit on the sidelines for profits? Can I?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, she thought of what he had always said to her. If he had known her earlier, he would not have let her suffer so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At the time, she only thought he was referring to the time she suffered in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, there was another meaning behind his words!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he had known and fallen in love with her sooner, he would not have sat on the sidelines. He would have protected her with all his might.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why did I get to know him so late? Why... didn't we meet before I... went to prison?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Tears trickled out of Grace's closed eyes, soaking her pillow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, she hoped more than ever that they could have known each other earlier. How wonderful it would have been... if they had known each other before everything happened...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace was discharged from the hospital, Jason did not appear before her. The Reed family's butler and bodyguard sent her back to Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The experienced caregiver whom Jason had hired would stay with Grace in her bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace suddenly found the house a little strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it because Jay isn&rsquo;t here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jay...' The thought of him sent a pang through her heart again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Over the next few days, Grace stayed in Reed Residence to rest and never went out. However, she noticed more security guards outside and inside the house than before. Even when she walked around the house, she was followed by at least three people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had told the butler that it was unnecessary to have three people follow her and one was enough. After all, she was only at home, not outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the butler said, "Young Master was the one who arranged it. If you want to reduce the number of people, you can call Young Master, Young Madam."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace immediately said nothing. 'Alright, three it is, then.'</p></div>
