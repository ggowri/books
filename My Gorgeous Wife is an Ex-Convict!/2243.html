        <h1>Chapter 2241</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was about to get out of the bathroom cubicle when she heard footsteps, followed by two women talking to each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is the woman who came for the pregnancy check-up today the wife of Martin Weiss, the president of the Weiss Group?" one of the women asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, that woman is dressed so simply. Who would have thought that she's the young madam of the Weiss family?" the other said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do they not get along with each other? They didn't come together and arrived at the hospital separately.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course not. If they don't get along with each other, would Martin Weiss come to the hospital once a month to get his blood drawn? And he even instructed us not to tell his wife. He said he doesn&rsquo;t want his wife to worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, right, he gets his blood drawn once a month. I heard he wants to do it until his wife gives birth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it safe for him to keep getting his blood drawn like that?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He seems to have signed a waiver with the hospital..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla tuned out to whatever they said next. All she could think about was... Martin Weiss getting his blood drawn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does Martin Weiss come to the hospital once a month to have his blood drawn? Is he going to continue doing it until I give birth? So&hellip; is he doing it for me?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She flung open the stall door and asked the nurses urgently, "Where in the hospital is Martin Weiss getting his blood drawn?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two nurses went silent at the sight of Kyla, knowing that they had blown the cover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Martin Weiss had clearly told the hospital not to tell his wife about him getting his blood drawn every month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh... Mrs. Weiss, we don't know what you're talking about. If what we just said gave you the wrong impression, we can explain..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before they could finish their words, Kyla asked again, "Where on earth is he? If you don't tell me, I'll go straight to your superiors and ask them. But I promise no one will know it was you two if you tell me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two nurses looked at each other, and one of them finally told her the room Martin Weiss was in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla left the washroom and walked toward the room after hearing that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she headed over, her mind was full of Martin Weiss's face and her pace quickened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she finally reached Blood-drawing Room No. 3, she saw the door open and Martin Weiss walking out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two happened to run into each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss froze and looked at Kyla in surprise. "What are you doing here..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Were you getting your blood drawn?" she asked. She could see that his face was pale and one of his sleeves was still rolled up. There was a bruise on his arm. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to take a closer look but he quickly pulled down his sleeve as if sensing something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait!" she shouted, holding his arm to stop him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She easily found a needle mark in the middle of the bruise, proving that he had indeed gotten his blood drawn just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you really just get your blood drawn?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;m just doing a body check-up. I need to do some blood tests, so they drew my blood," he said casually, pulling his arm from her hand and rolling down his sleeve. "Aren't you supposed to be having your pregnancy check-up today? What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stared at Martin Weiss, who looked so pale it made his skin seem almost transparent.</p></div>
