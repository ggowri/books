        <h1>Chapter 3618</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, is something happening at school...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Jasper could finish her sentence, William interrupted her, saying, "Whatever it is, I will handle it. Don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Jasper understood that what she had guessed, he had actually guessed too.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry, everything will be fine," he said, "No need to worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," she nodded. But after William left, Jasper didn't go back to her room. Instead, she headed towards the security office at the entrance of the school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to ask the school security about what happened to William's grandparents after she and William left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before she reached the school gate, someone grabbed her arm, causing her to stop in her tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper turned around and saw that the person pulling her was Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing?" she glared at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about you? What do you want to do?" he retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What I want to do has nothing to do with you," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you trying to go to the security at the school gate and ask what happened after you left?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She widened her eyes, looking at him in disbelief. How did he guess?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, William is already in trouble. Do you still plan on getting involved with him?" Roger said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She furrowed her brow. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You wanted to know what happened after you two left, right?" Roger said. "Well, I can tell you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know?" she exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I was also in the crowd at that time, but you didn't see me," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, he was watching her in the crowd, but her gaze was only on the two elderly people. And after William arrived, her gaze was only on him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, an uncomfortable feeling spread throughout her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper paused for a moment. She couldn't really remember if Roger was among the people who were present today, watching.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After you left, some people approached them and asked about their relationship with William. And some people even used their phones to find out that they are William's mother Lily's parents."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Although their current appearance is very different from the photos that were once captured by the news media online, there are still traces of their past."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And soon after, reporters arrived..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Jasper exclaimed. "You said reporters also came?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, reporters came to interview them. It seems like they are very interested in their current situation. After all, the Atkinson family in Emerald City used to be a prominent and even had a marriage agreement with your Reed family." Roger said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pursed her lips. Initially, this matter was confined to the school, but now that reporters have arrived, it means that the situation will escalate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, it is necessary to quickly have the family suppress any news reports that might be detrimental to William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this in mind, Jasper hurriedly took out her phone, intending to call her father. However, Roger grabbed her hand and said, "What? Are you planning to call your father and have him sweep this matter under the rug?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once again, he seemed to have guessed her intentions correctly. Jasper looked surprised, as if Roger could read her mind.</span></p></div>
