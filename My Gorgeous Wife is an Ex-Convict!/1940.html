        <h1>Chapter 1938</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, any employee in the company who knew about the president's past could all figure out that Lina was the president's ex-girlfriend. There were even videos of them online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When reporters surrounded Lina and accused her of being a homewrecker, the president took her away. His domineering protectiveness even caused the company&rsquo;s employees to speculate whether she would marry the president in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the president came back to J City himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hence, many people thought this woman had lost her chance but she came looking for the president again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina blinked her round eyes as she looked at Hadwin Stephenson and said, "Well... Why don't we talk in your office? You don't want anyone to know what you have of mine, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What if I don't mind? Tell me what I have of yours," Hadwin Stephenson snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you really want me to?" Lina hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Go ahead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Lina cleared her throat and said, "I didn't take the ginger brown sugar as well as menstrual pads that you helped me buy, and&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's enough!" Hadwin Stephenson interrupted Lina with a grim expression as he raised his hand to rub his forehead. "Come to my office!" He felt that his mood would fluctuate so much whenever she was involved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina instantly showed a smug look. She hurriedly followed Hadwin Stephenson to the office but remembered to bring the snacks along before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Stephenson Group's free snacks for employees taste pretty good!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The employees who heard what Lina said looked at each other. 'The president bought ginger brown sugar and... menstrual pads for this woman...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'That's kind of a hard picture to associate with the president!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After entering the office, Hadwin Stephenson turned around and glared at Lina behind him. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I only said that because I wanted to see you, but... I did leave all this stuff at your mansion..." Her voice trailed under his glare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I threw out those things long ago. Did you expect me to keep them after all these years?!" Hadwin Stephenson yelled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did you throw away the matching pillows, mugs, and slippers I bought too?" Lina blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was her first time dating, so she was fond of matching couple items. She often bought some and kept them in his mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He seemed dismissive at first but ended up using whatever she had bought anyway.</p></div>
