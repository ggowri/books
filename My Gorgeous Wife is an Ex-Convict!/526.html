        <h1>Chapter 525</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, let me hold you for a while. The driver will be here soon," Jason whispered softly. He took a look at the person in his arms and then turned his head to glance at Brian who was watching them from nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men's eyes met once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, a black car pulled over in front of Jason, and he withdrew his gaze. Shortly after, Jason got into the car with Grace. Grace had her back toward Brian and Evelyn the whole time and thus did not see them even though the two had been standing nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn pressed against her red lips until the black car disappeared. She looked up. "Li&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had only opened her mouth and the rest of her voice became lost in her throat. The handsome face of the man before her which usually had a cold and distant expression now looked subdued and oppressive. It was as if he was trying desperately to restrain himself. It was so much so that his handsome face even looked a little distorted&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was like a man... desperately trying to suppress his jealousy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace returned to the Reed Residence, Jason took another look at her to make sure she was not hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should go to bed early. You have to work tomorrow," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Grace nodded. The small restaurant would reopen the next day, and she had to get up early in the morning. "What about you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have a few things to take care of. I'll go to bed after I'm done with them," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thus, Grace washed up and went to bed. On the other hand, Jason went to his study and called Terrence, his secretary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Look into the Farmer family of San Wang Convenience Store for me," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Farmer family?" replied Terrence immediately after being taken aback for a moment. He was clueless as to how the Farmer family had gotten into trouble with the boss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Tasha Farmer got home, she told her family about the incident. Sure enough, her parents were shocked to find out about it. Her brother even scolded her for being so stupid to have offended Jason out of all people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Furthermore, they became extremely mad when they found out that she had taken the lead for Elsie Jordan, and the latter ended up denying her involvement in the matter completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Farmer family was in deep trouble because of their tax affairs. They had been afraid to attend the banquet as they would be questioned by reporters there. Thus, they made Tasha Farmer, who usually had no business to do with their company, attend the banquet to cotton up to the Lu and ZAtkinson family. Who would have thought that it would turn out this way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I did it for our family. Worst comes to the worst, I'll just apologize to Grace," Tasha Farmer said reluctantly. Nonetheless, in her heart, she felt that if she did go and apologize to Grace, the matter would be resolved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, Mr. and Mrs. Wang sighed. "It's the only way. Get something expensive later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they were later on refused entry at the Reed Residence. They could not get in. Additionally, the Reed family's butler merely told them with a poker face, "The young master said he has no time to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We just want to apologize. After all, Miss Cummins suffered injustice because of my daughter's recklessness," said Mr. Wang. He was usually a big boss in the eyes of others and had never been so humble to a butler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, this housekeeper was the Reed family's butler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The young master said that you should start worrying about your own affairs instead of waiting here," the butler said as he turned around and entered the house, shutting the iron gate behind him.</p></div>
