        <h1>Chapter 1961</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, her voice quietly rang in his ears. "Hadwin, how about I stay here with you until after your birthday? The swelling on my face should be gone by then, and I can wait here for you to come back after your birthday party to have cake with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"..." He did not answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Lina was delighted. He did not reject her, which meant he agreed to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's birthday party could be said to be one of the most popular events in J City, especially since it was said that most of J City's single socialites had been invited to the party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, someone even joked that it was not a birthday party but a wife selection party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Of course, the rich families were still a little concerned about Emily Flowers's identity as a homewrecker. After all, it was nothing glorious, but Stephenson Group was now on a roll. Even if Emily Flowers's identity was nothing glorious, Hadwin Stephenson was the patriarch of the Stephenson family, after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The family of the bride marrying into the Stephenson family would benefit a lot!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, the whole party was bustling. Emily Flowers dressed up luxuriously. She even wore the Stephenson family's heirloom jade as if to tell others that she was the real owner of the Stephenson family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson listened idly as his mother introduced him to one socialite after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">These women were not bad-looking, plus they had put in the effort to dress up, so one could consider them beautiful. Besides, their families were popular in J City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If it were before he met Lina, he would be so intent on getting to the top that he would not care what kind of woman he married but her family background.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, looking at these women now, he remembered Lina's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Not interested in any of these women?" Emily Flowers asked when it was just the two of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, I&rsquo;ll decide what kind of woman I want to marry, and I&rsquo;ll look for her myself," said Hadwin Stephenson, hinting at his mother not to arrange such blind dates for him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I like the Tang family's heiress. The Tang family is also influential in J City. Their ancestors left them a lot of properties and they have investments overseas. Miss Keller is knowledgeable and gentle. I like her very much," Emily Flowers said pointedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you like her, you can have her as your goddaughter," said Hadwin Stephenson. He understood what his mother meant, but he had no feelings for Miss Keller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers's expression changed before she smiled and handed her son a glass of wine. "If you don't like her, then I won't force it. Alright, I wish you a happy birthday!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson took the glass and gently clinked it with the glass in his mother's hand before downing the wine in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers smiled meaningfully as she watched her son finish the glass of wine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I'll have things go my way no matter what. As for Lina, so what if my son has feelings for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'A woman like that doesn't deserve the Stephenson family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Once my son and the Tang family's heiress get together, Lina will not have any chance!'</p></div>
