        <h1>Chapter 2693</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller recuperated at home after getting discharged from the hospital the next day. After all, she dared not meet people with those bruises on her face!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland would drop by from time to time to update her on the situation with the film crew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The actors involved in the strike could not even enter the film studio. Hart Group had sent the actors' information to the security guards at the film studio's entrance. Therefore, the security guards would stop them outside as soon as they saw them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Events of that day did not make the news, but the film crew was struggling. They had stopped filming to discuss whether to change locations or actors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The discussion had been going on for a few days without any conclusion. However, Camille Strickland thought they should have reached a conclusion within one or two days. After all, a day off from filming meant a day's loss of money. The actors had their own schedules too. It would be problematic if this went on for a long time and conflicted with their schedules.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, I'm still in shock that the crown prince is your boyfriend," Camille Strickland said emotionally as she ate fruit in front of the TV.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was shocked too," said Valda Theller. Although she could tell that Brian was quite rich before finding out his identity, she did not expect him to be rich to that extent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me, is there any future between you and him?" Camille Strickland joked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller shook her head. "You know we're only pretending to be dating. Besides, he already has someone he loves."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help going online to find some information while she was at home these days. She found out that the woman Brian loved, Grace, was the wife of Emerald City's Young master Reed Jason. They had three children together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even fell into a trance as she looked at Grace's photo online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not have a good look at her when they met in the shopping mall that day because they only had a quick chat and she was nervous. She only saw her clearly now after seeing her photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the woman Brian loved deeply!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know. The netizens are saying that Brian loves Grace, but she has already married Jason. You're dating Brian now. Didn't he also say he gave you the right to break up with him? Just never break up with him," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "How is that possible? I'll probably break up with him after we accomplish the goal of our relationship." After all, there was no guarantee she would not fall in love with him if they stayed together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is his goal of dating you?" Camille Strickland asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know. Maybe he'll tell me in the future." She only speculated that he was dating another woman to reassure Grace that the man who admired her had moved on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, wouldn't it be a pity if you broke up with him?" Camille Strickland mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller confessed, "I'll probably think it's a pity. But what isn't mine won't be mine. I don't want to be greedy. It's a special experience to date him like this. I'll probably shock my grandchildren when I tell them about it when I'm old."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&rsquo;re not even fighting for yourself. Other people will try their best to make it real if they have the chance you have," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled slightly. "It's probably because I'm already too old to dream like that, so I don't fantasize myself being Cinderella who&rsquo;ll meet her Prince Charming."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she occasionally felt touched, she told herself to control her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was probably gentle to her because he was her boyfriend in name. Without the label, that gentleness would not exist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The film crew finally decided to replace all the actors involved in the strike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gloria was the male lead in the drama, so it was natural that it would receive media attention.</p></div>
