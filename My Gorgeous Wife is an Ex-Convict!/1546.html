        <h1>Chapter 1544</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mhm..." A groan could not help escaping his mouth. The next moment, she took the opportunity to enter his mouth and deepen the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'This woman is... doing it again...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, his fingers seemed powerless to push her away, or... did he just not want to do so?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the kiss was over, Grace looked at the man underneath her with a red face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Those dark eyes were cold and confused. The contradiction showed in his eyes. His face was expressionless, but his lips looked somewhat wet because of the kiss just now. They were beautiful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just looking at them made her want to kiss him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you know how good-looking you are? And how attractive you are to women? What makes you think I'm not that in love with you and that I'm not swept off my feet by you? Or do you have no confidence in yourself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She ran the tips of her fingers over his wet lips as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." He immediately grabbed her hand. She was teasing him with his actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He felt something somewhat different with her finger bones when he held her hand like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason then noticed that her fingers were slightly deformed compared to ordinary people and did not look good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The sight suddenly stung his eyes. "Why are your fingers&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Nothing. I suffered some minor injuries in prison and this happened to my fingers," she said in an understatement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was silent while Grace looked down at their hands. She held Jason's hand back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She held it hard, and those almond-shaped eyes looked up slightly to stare at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, you just have to know that I love you very much. I must have left because I had no choice. But even if I really did leave, I'll always find a way back to you and won't let you go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her voice was calm but strong, and her eyes were as clear as water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stared at her blankly. 'She won't let me go?' The look in her eyes, the sound of her voice, and the way she had just kissed him seemed to tell him how much she loved him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What were my feelings for her previously? Even though I don't remember her, my body seems to react to her and is unable to resist her approach and kisses.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if she could do whatever she wanted with him as long as she did not leave him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the idea flashed across his mind, Jason was stunned for a moment and looked at Grace more thoughtfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he did love this woman like what the others said, he would not reject the idea of this woman entering his life. Besides, they had two children together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... "Don't lie to me. You can't afford to lie to me!" Jason said coldly as he looked at the woman before him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Every word I said is true." Grace's eyes did not avoid his gaze. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?" The corners of his lips rose slightly. His eyes wandered over to his hand which she was holding. "Since you said you won't let go of me, if you do, you won't just lose your fingers but both of your hands."</p></div>
