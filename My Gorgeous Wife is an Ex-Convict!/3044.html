        <h1>Chapter 3042</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A few children clamored to go for a boat ride, so after finishing their meal, everyone got on the small boat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A small boat was sailing on the river when suddenly Jasper exclaimed in surprise and pointed to the distance, saying, "What is that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The boat owner smiled and said, "That's a reservoir. It usually drains before the rainy season, so there won't be much activity otherwise. Some kids around here like to swim and play over there in the summer. The water is cooler over there during the summer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But if we go swimming over by the reservoir, won't it be dangerous?" Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're right! Someone drowned a few years ago," said the boat owner. "But it didn't help, people still go swimming there every year. However, I heard that downstream of the reservoir, they're building a rafting project and our Deer Capital's largest outdoor swimming pool has been under construction for half a year. It seems like it will be completed in a few months. When that swimming pool is finished, it will be open for free to nearby residents like us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's quite good," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A few children started discussing whether they could swim or not. Mick and Simon can swim, while Jasper and William cannot swim yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "It's necessary to learn how to swim, after all, it's a survival skill."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, the younger you learn, the better. Sometimes it's not easy to learn when you grow up. I'm a negative example," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, you can't swim?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, when I first started working, I wanted to learn, but I couldn't even after splashing around in the pool for a long time," Valda said. Camille tried to teach her for a long time, but it ended in failure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then let me teach you next time," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll teach me?" Valda blinked, and suddenly imagined Brian in swimming trunks...then her face couldn't help but turn red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Auntie Valda, why is your face so red?" Jasper asked, staring at the blush on Valda's face with his focused eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as he spoke, everyone's gaze focused on Valda's face, and her face became even redder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's...nothing, just...a little hot," Valda said awkwardly, fanning herself with her hand next to her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What's wrong with her? What is she even thinking about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, on the other side of the Barlow House, Whitney is wearing clothes similar to those Grace wore before leaving today and applying makeup that resembles Grace's usual look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney's hairstyle, clothing, and makeup were all very similar to Grace's. In addition, Whitney had previously intentionally imitated Grace. Therefore, when she appeared at the Barlow House's doorstep, she did not arouse suspicion from others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Barlow family's servants were simply surprised and asked, "Mrs. Reed, how come you came back alone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"After I went out today, I noticed a slight cough, so I came back on my own and let Jason continue to play with the children," Whitney imitated Grace's tone and deliberately coughed a few times. This way, even though her voice was different, it wouldn't arouse suspicion. "By the way, how is Jasmine doing now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Jasmine just drank milk and has fallen asleep now," replied the servant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take me to see Jasmine, I really miss her today," said Whitney. She didn't actually know which room Jasmine Reed was in because the high-powered telescope could only show some of the Barlow family's surroundings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, the servant didn't ask any more questions and instead followed the instructions, bringing Whitney to a room where Jasmine was peacefully sleeping in her crib. There was also a nanny watching over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You go out first and take a rest. I want to take care of Jasmine by myself for a while. I'll call you if I need anything," said Whitney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." The nanny responded and left the room.</p></div>
