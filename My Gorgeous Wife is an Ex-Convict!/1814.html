        <h1>Chapter 1812</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he could not help saying the word &lsquo;okay&rsquo; when his eyes met those sparkly ones!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lily's parents returned to Emerald City to handle her funeral arrangements. Harold Atkinson and his wife did not want to take custody of their grandson, William. After all, they were not doing well right now. With their age, it was going to be even harder with a child around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, even though they knew the child was now living with the Reed family, they did not mention taking him back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason did not mention William to Harold Atkinson and his wife either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if William did not exist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sean was still in the hospital. Although he survived, he still suffered from various side effects from the treatment and was in great pain every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he learned of Lily's death, he simply squeezed three words from between his teeth. "She deserved it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All he had left for Lily, the woman he once loved, was hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His whole life was ruined at the hands of Lily. He only agreed to commit that crime for his son!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it turned out that the child was not related to him at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lily... really fooled him this time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The once-popular celebrity did not even get a funeral. Harold Atkinson and his wife had their daughter's body hastily cremated before leaving Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Standing alone in front of the gate of Reed Residence, William heard from the maids' children that his grandparents had come to Emerald City and taken away his mother's ashes. However, they never even visited him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Even your grandparents don't want you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you think you'll lead a better life in the future if you please Miss Jay? She won't want you one day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Miss Jay just doesn't know what your mommy did to Young Madam. Your mommy even kidnapped Young Master Ci and asked for a lot of money. How evil!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Their words were still ringing in his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew that Mommy had done something bad, and he also knew that he would have to leave the Reed family one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William, there you are. I've been looking for you for a long time. Master Big Beard taught me a new song just now. I played it once and it's a beautiful tune. Listen to it!" Jasper rushed forward and grabbed William's little arm to take him to the main house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, his little body did not move, and his feet remained on the same spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter?" She turned to look at him in confusion. She saw him standing by the iron gate. "Do you want to go out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William bit his lower lip. He had wanted to go out earlier to go to his grandparents and ask them why they did not even visit him. Was it because his mother had done something bad, so it meant he was going to do something bad in the future too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it suddenly did not seem that important anymore when he saw Jasper in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll tell Uncle Kwan to bring you out! Where do you want to go?" asked Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William shook his head. "I don't want to go out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well, just tell me if you do. By the way, do you want to go to kindergarten? Why don't I tell Daddy and Mommy to let you go to kindergarten? Then we can spend more time together every day," she said.</p></div>
