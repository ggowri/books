        <h1>Chapter 853</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Chase Harper were having lunch in a restaurant near the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she came to the hospital today to visit Baldwin who was still in a coma, she bumped into Chase Harper again. Chase Harper stayed with her while she gathered all kinds of materials. He even did some errands for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could somewhat see through him too. It seemed that Chase Harper still liked her. However, he did not say it out loud, so she just stayed quiet about it and tried her best to keep her distance so as to avoid giving him the wrong idea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was at the hospital until nearly one o'clock in the afternoon. Grace was so busy that she even forgot about lunch. She had not eaten and neither had Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&rsquo;ve helped me a lot today. Why don't I treat you to lunch?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper smiled shyly. "I'm a man. I should be the one to treat you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It has nothing to do with whether you're a man. If I ever help you out with something, then it's never too late to treat me," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper's eyes lit up as he nodded his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The restaurant near the hospital served common dishes. Grace ordered two set meals for herself and Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them were eating when Chase Harper's phone rang. Chase Harper answered his phone. "Hmm... Yes... Mom, don't worry about me. Well... I won't go. I have someone I like. I'm not going, so don't ask your girlfriends to help me find..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's hand stopped mid-air as she held the chopsticks. Even if she did not hear what Chase Harper's mother was saying on the other end of the line, judging from what Chase Harper was saying, it sounded like she was trying to help her son find a girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Chase Harper said he had someone he liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could he be talking about... me?' Grace's heart somehow felt heavier and so did the chopsticks in her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If possible, she hoped she was not the person Chase Harper liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so emotionally scarred that she could not afford another person's affection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the phone call, Chase Harper suddenly looked at Grace with some embarrassment as if he had noticed something. He happened to meet her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I..." He seemed to want to say something but did not know how to. He was so embarrassed that he was at a loss. He unconsciously wiped his hand to the side but accidentally knocked over the half-drunk bowl of soup. It immediately spilled on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper's face turned red instantly. He hurriedly tried to clean up after the mess, but he only made it worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly got up and took some paper towels. She went to Chase Harper's side and helped him wipe the soup off his clothes. Then, she quickly cleaned the table and asked the waiter for a cloth to wipe the spilled soup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper was embarrassed. He was several years older than her but when an emergency happened, she was the one calmly helping him while he was at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," he said, blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Be careful," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that... you're good at taking care of people," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled faintly. "Maybe it's because I live alone. Now, when you get home, soak the clothes in detergent so that there won't be any stains."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," he replied. Then, he suddenly asked, "Are you... currently living alone too?"</p></div>
