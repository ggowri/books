        <h1>Chapter 240</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace just felt like she was a panda being watched by the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmm? Does Sis really want me to send you?" His voice once again rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blushed even more before quickly saying, "No." With that, she hurried back into her room and shut the adjoining door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled faintly. When he turned around, his face reverted to its usual expression. He went to the chair and sat down, reconnecting the audio system.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's proceed with the meeting," Jason said lightly, seemingly ignoring the fact that everyone was trying to pry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, is this the one who called you during our last meeting?" someone asked as he could not help but pry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly. "Why, do you want to know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the man shivered and said with a dry smile, "Then... We'll just proceed with the meeting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although it was a meeting, there was a voice in everyone's heart that speculated that their president seemed to be living together&hellip; with a woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was surprised when she went to look for Grace in the rented house but found nothing. There was no one in the rented house at all. There was no light, and no one answered when she knocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought Grace was out and had not come back, so she ended up waiting until after 1 a.m. She was getting sick from the cold, but Grace still had not come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She left in a rage and found her the next morning at the Sanitation Service Center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I need to see you!" Wearing sunglasses, a face mask, and a baseball cap, Evelyn looked like she was terrified that a celebrity like her would be recognized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she forgot that she and Brian had never been seen together in public and that even though she was now a second female lead in a big-budget film, everyone was on the set treated her well only because they had to give her a little face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Out in the public, few people actually recognized her. To the general public, she was only a C-list actress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is there to talk about?" Grace gave her a cold look. She then took her cleaning tools and put them on the Sanitation Service Center's bicycle before saying to Evelyn, "Excuse me, I still have work to do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a disgusted glance at the dirty bicycle, Evelyn subconsciously took a step back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace directly got on her bicycle and rode out the Sanitation Service Center's entrance, leaving Evelyn to stomp her foot in anger. She could only dash out and get a car to follow Grace to the road where she swept.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis, why are you doing this? I came to see you today just to ask you something. We are sisters after all. It&rsquo;s not very nice of you to do that." Evelyn now softened her attitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace still ignored Evelyn and started to sweep the rubbish on the road.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn saw this and frowned a little before following Grace. She said, "Sis, I came here today to apologize for hurting your hand. Sorry about that day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Right, it seems that you didn't pay me the medical expenses the other day. Please settle the bill," Grace said.</p></div>
