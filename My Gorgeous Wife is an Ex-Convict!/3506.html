        <h1>Chapter 3504</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because you look like you're feeling really sad," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He paused, is he feeling very sad from his expression now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She lifted her hand and lightly brushed his eye corner with her fingertips, "It's like you're about to cry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His hand suddenly grabbed her finger, "If I really want to cry because I can't get something, what would you do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cry because you can't get it?" She laughed, "Are you a child? Wait, I didn't see you cry when you were little because you couldn't get something!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"As you grow up, some things will always change," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure." She thought for a moment and said, "As long as it's not something impossible or morally wrong, I will help you get what you want so that you won't cry anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" He looked at her with a meaningful gaze, "Then, if I really want that thing in the future, please help me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze made her feel a little embarrassed, and her face inexplicably turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The way he stared at her just now was like the male lead in those movies and TV shows staring at the female lead, which made her increasingly uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Subconsciously, she suddenly lifted the other hand that he didn't catch and directly covered his eyes with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" He stood still, letting her cover his eyes with her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't look at me with that kind of gaze like you did just now!" She said, that kind of gaze would make her feel a strange feeling that she couldn't even explain to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body seemed to stiffen slightly, and after a moment, he slowly said, "Okay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She finally removed her hands from his face, and his gaze at her did indeed return to normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She breathed a sigh of relief and asked, "By the way, what is that thing you wanted in the end?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyelashes trembled slightly, and with half-closed eyes, he said, "You'll know in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, if you really can't get it, you must tell me! I don't want to see you cry!" She said in a carefree manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I'll definitely tell you!" He said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What he wanted was her love!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as she was willing to give it to him, he would cherish it with all his time for the rest of his life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the nurse finished changing Veronica's medication, she left the room. A moment later, Mason walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't say anything, just looked at her quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? You're not saying anything?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pursed his lips and after a while, he said, "Lionel can be released on bail tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then my dad and the others should be able to breathe a sigh of relief," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But for now, it's only bail. As for whether he will be convicted or not, we have to wait for the court's verdict," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Will he... go to jail? Or maybe a juvenile correctional facility?" she asked. After all, she had been with Lionel for so many years and knew that he wasn't really a bad person, just a bit spoiled by his stepmother and always hanging out with bad friends, neglecting his studies and pretending to be an adult in society.</p></div>
