        <h1>Chapter 2485</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All you have to do is publicly state that you&rsquo;ve recovered and moved back to the Mitchell family&rsquo;s house. At least pretend to bury the hatchet with the Mitchell family," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory, you know Louise Mitchell and the rest framed me and forced me into a mental hospital even though I was fine, but you want me to tell the public that I was a mental patient? I recovered because they put me in the hospital, and I&rsquo;m grateful to them? You want me to pretend everything's fine?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her sarcastic voice made him frown slightly. "Since it has happened, you should think about your future life. Do you think you can depend on Grace and the Reed family forever?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It turns out you don't know right from wrong and good from evil. You speak so nonchalantly. If someone had locked you up in a mental hospital for so many years in the best years of your life, would you be able to do what you just said?&rdquo; Amber Mitchell said with amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want?" George Gregory asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shouted, "What do I want? I want the truth to be revealed to the public and the Mitchell family to get what they deserve! Do you have any idea what it&rsquo;s like for a mentally sane person to be forced to undergo treatment in a mental institution? Do you have any idea what it's like to be abused like animals every day? Even&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She jerked up her right hand. The gap where her missing finger should be was so glaring. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know how I lost this finger?" she asked with a chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her smile gave him a strange uneasiness. It was as if the truth would be too much for him to bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips opened and closed. He asked, "How... did you lose it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Remember the wedding ring you gave me? You left the ring with me after buying it, and I happened to be wearing it the day I was admitted to the mental hospital. I was so upset and sad that day because I knew my and Herman's car accident had made you the laughing stock of tMason Swansonty. Back then, I thought that I would marry you and love you forever if you believed that I never betrayed you. If you didn&rsquo;t believe me, I'd break off the engagement, resist all abuse, and not let you suffer the slightest injustice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The decision she had thought about thousands of times over came out of her mouth so calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had no idea how anxious she was when she made the decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She loved him and did not want him to suffer due to the incident, so she was willing to shoulder the burden herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had no idea that fate would play such a big prank on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's expression changed slightly as if he never expected her to make such a decision. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You said you wanted me to believe you, but how could I believe you loved me when you were like that with Herman Moss?!" he yelled while staring at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled indifferently. "It seems that we wouldn't have ended up together even if I wasn't admitted to the mental hospital. It's because you&rsquo;ve never really believed me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was suddenly flustered. However, why was he flustered? He was still the high and mighty President George Gregory, while she was only the eldest heiress of the Mitchell family who had lost everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell paused. "You might or might not believe what I'm going to say. I was wearing the ring when I was forcibly admitted to the mental hospital. Louise Mitchell said I didn&rsquo;t deserve the ring. But my finger was red and swollen because I kept struggling when I was admitted to the hospital. I couldn't take the ring off at all. Do you know what she did after that?"</p></div>
