        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She also did not understand why Jennifer's car had been rushing toward her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">What made her even more confused was why those witness statements were all targeted at her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She could not explain. All the witnesses and evidence at that time had proven that she was the perpetrator.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Admittedly, the accident had been traumatic and some of the details surrounding the investigation that followed were still murky. She&rsquo;d been in shock.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she couldn&rsquo;t for the life of her understand how there was so much security or camera footage. Almost every street in the city had some kind of traffic camera. And the people who&rsquo;d been witnesses, they&rsquo;d all had the exact same version of events.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But as an attorney, she knew that rarely happened either. People always had different perceptions, based on their physical position in relation to a crime, their age, sex, and perspective.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even something as simple as running a traffic light could be interpreted in different ways, depending on who you asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Could it have been something else entirely?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jennifer had been about to marry Jason Reed, President of the Reed Group. She had been in the prime of her life and there had been no reason for her to want to commit suicide by crashing into a car.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Grace, do you want to appeal the case?" Jay asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Somehow, I don&rsquo;t think that will do me much good.&rdquo; Grace laughed self-deprecatingly. "I just feel a little unreconciled. I know I&rsquo;m innocent, so it&rsquo;s hard for me to let it go.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason grunted.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Grace said, closing the folder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy to overturn a case. I'm out now. I should be thankful for that and just look forward. No one ever said life would be fair, right? Well, let's not talk about this anymore. I'll blow dry your hair."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she spoke, she put away the documents and then used a hairdryer to help him dry his head of wet hair.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason's eyes gradually deepened&hellip;and a plan took form.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next day, Terrence saw the dramatic change to Mr. Reed&rsquo;s hairstyle. Gone was the drawn-back ponytail, and in its place were layers that while still maintaining some length, were short enough to frame his face. He didn&rsquo;t remember scheduling an appointment with a hairstylist, and he knew Mr. Reed&rsquo;s schedule inside and out.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's wrong?" Perhaps it was because he had been staring at him for a long time that Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence tilted his head. &ldquo;It seems you haven't had a haircut for a long time. Do you want me to arrange an appointment with the stylist?" Terrence asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"There's no need. Grace helped me trim my hair last night."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">So it had been Grace! However, what surprised Terrence, even more, was that Mr. ReedMr. Reed had actually... allowed Grace to cut his hair.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Reed wasn&rsquo;t vain but he did insist on the highest quality products for everything in his life, and that included having his hair maintained by a top-tier hairstylist.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was... Now she was just a street sweeper, but even in the past, Grace had been a lawyer, not a hairdresser.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The trim isn't too bad, huh?" Jason fiddled with his bangs, seeming quite satisfied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The corner of Terrence's mouth twitched. &ldquo;I like it.&rdquo; Mr. Reed had always been very picky. If the top-tier hairstylists that had been specially chosen by him found out that they could not compare to the skills of a street sweeper, what would they think?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&mdash;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At noon, Lina took time off to meet up with Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two of them found a small restaurant near the Sanitation Service Center to eat at.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Lily made things difficult for you that day and asked you to go through the garbage for a long time. Why didn't you tell me?" Lina complained. As a good friend, she had only found out about this matter through the news.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's not a big deal," Grace said with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at such a good friend, for some reason, Lina's heart ached. &ldquo;It is. It&rsquo;s not fair to you, Grace. You&rsquo;ve been through enough!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Back in the earlier days of their friendship, Grace seemed to have been blessed by luck. She had made great strides in her studies and had always been the top student in school. Once out in society, she had gotten into the best law firm in the City and even began a relationship with Sean&mdash;the most eligible bachelor around.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Almost everyone envied her. If she was being honest, even Lina had her days of envy. She was always happy for her friend, but admittedly, sometimes she&rsquo;d wanted some of that good fortune for herself.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After everything that happened to Grace, she felt extra guilty about that now.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">They would never have expected that one day, Grace would be falsely convicted, subjected to all kinds of horrors in prison, and left to take the only job she could find as a street sweeper.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The last insult from Lily&hellip; having to dig through garbage for hours, it was too much!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?" Grace could not help but sigh as Lina shook her head and frowned. &ldquo;Hey, I'm fine. Really. It&rsquo;s just some garbage.&rdquo; A small smile played on Grace&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Besides, if the social media sites are anything to go by, Lily is the one to pay the price for it. People hate her for what she&rsquo;s done. It&rsquo;s an affront on common people, it seems.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough, Grace. Lily has gone overboard. It is one thing for her family to find someone to deal with you in prison. However, they continue to create such difficulties even after you've been released.&rdquo; Lina huffed indignantly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace remained silent. Back then, she had suffered a lot in prison. Part of it had come from those who wanted to please Reed Corporation, and the rest had come from those who had been bribed by the Atkinson family.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She bore scars from their efforts. Some of those scars would never heal&hellip;</p></div>
