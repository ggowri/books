        <h1>Chapter 2831</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Valda Theller as she walked into the changing room. With the staff's help, she changed into the gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The gown fit her well, making her look classy and elegant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The makeup artist started to apply Valda Theller's makeup. While they chatted, Valda Theller learned that the gown and jewelry were made by the same famous foreign designer. Besides that, it was the only set.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This gown and jewelry got quite a few compliments when they were shown at the fashion show. Many people wanted to buy the set. Who knew Young Master Hart bought it and gave it to you, Miss Theller? Young Master Hart really cares about you," the makeup artist smiled and said. Their words were somewhat obsequious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled politely. She and Brian were not what others thought they were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had to admit that Brian had given her enough face as his girlfriend even though he did not love her. At least outsiders thought he doted on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When her makeup and hair were done, Valda Theller looked at herself in the mirror. She looked like a new person. Although she was still the same person, her temperament had changed, and her facial features were improved. She looked like the socialites she saw on the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me help you put on the jewelry," the makeup artist said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," replied Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The makeup artist was about to pick up the sapphire necklace in the box when the dressing room door was suddenly pushed open. Several people entered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So it really is you, Valda Theller." A voice rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller recognized the person as Phoebe Cross, the heiress of Song Yuan Group and Brian's childhood friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller had met Phoebe Cross at a party before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Song, what do you need?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't need anything. I just heard that Brian had arranged people to serve you here, so I came over to have a look." Phoebe Cross sized up the gown Valda Theller was wearing and saw the sapphire jewelry on the dressing table out of the corners of her eyes. Envy instantly flickered in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had had her eye on that gown and jewelry and wanted to buy them, but someone else had already bought them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who knew Valda Theller had them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'...Did Brian give them to Valda Theller?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not attending the charity gala tonight too, are you?" Phoebe Cross asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'm attending it," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sure someone from a regular family like you don't often attend such parties. You won&rsquo;t be the only one embarrassed if you make a mistake. You'll also affect Brian. You shouldn&rsquo;t bother attending such galas," said Phoebe Cross.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled. "I&rsquo;ve promised Brian to attend the gala with him tonight. Brian will remind me if I make a mistake, so you have nothing to worry about, Miss Song."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross's face darkened as she was tactfully rebuked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The people beside Phoebe Cross said, "Is this Brian's girlfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, she's a comic artist." Phoebe Cross introduced dismissively.</p></div>
