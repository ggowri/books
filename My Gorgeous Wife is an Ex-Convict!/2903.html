        <h1>Chapter 2901</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When it was Valda Theller's turn, she entered the consultation room while Brian Hart waited outside. At that moment, he seemed somewhat restless, pacing back and forth, speculating on what could have caused her stomach ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wasn't that your girlfriend who just went in?" someone next to Brian Hart spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart looked over and saw a middle-aged man who appeared to be in his fifties or sixties.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, Brian Hart didn't know how to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's not my girlfriend, she's my wife, do you even need to ask?" the man's companion, an elderly woman, chuckled. "Look at how worried he is. When you used to worry about me, he looked just like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're my wife, who else would I worry about?" the man replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman laughed, her wrinkled face looking so sweet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the door to the consultation room opened and Valda Theller walked out, her face flushed, one hand covering her stomach, and she headed towards the exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What did the doctor say?" Brian Hart asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked embarrassed and hesitated for a moment before saying, "I need to go buy something. You...you can sit here for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you need to buy? Let me go get it for you," he said urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can go buy it myself," she replied, even more embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't go out like this. Where do you need to go? I'll go for you!" He picked her up and placed her in a nearby chair. His phoenix eyes stared straight at her. "What do you need to buy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller glanced around and saw that the other patients in the waiting area were all looking over at them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And from the way Brian Hart looked, it was clear that he had no intention of letting her go alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only blush and say, "Can you...lower your head a bit?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her with a hint of confusion, but still lowered his head as she wished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised her head slightly and whispered in his ear, "I...I got my period. Are you going to go to the hospital's convenience store and buy me some sanitary pads?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying this, Valda Theller felt like her face was about to bleed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And after hearing her words, Brian Hart's face also turned red with embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So I'll just go buy it myself," Valda Theller said, intending to get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart held her shoulder and said, "Sit down, I'll go!" He then quickly left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared at Brian Hart's back in a daze. Was he really going to buy...sanitary pads for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the couple who had chatted with Brian Hart earlier and sat next to Valda Theller smiled at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is he your boyfriend or husband? When you went in just now, he was so worried, pacing back and forth," the woman asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man chimed in, "He must really love you. Sometimes, it takes adversity to reveal true feelings. He must love you very much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Love? Valda Theller bit her lip and said, "We're just ordinary friends." In fact, they weren't even friends anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just friends? That's impossible," the couple clearly didn't believe her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman said, "Young lady, if you're afraid of being just friends with someone, you might regret it in the future. You might miss out on a man who is so good to you and cares about you so much. And I can see that he's handsome too. There are probably countless women outside who would want to pursue him."</p></div>
