        <h1>Chapter 2555</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She interrupted him and said, "It&rsquo;s not because he saved my life! It's because... I love Herman. Marrying him is my greatest wish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory felt like he had been struck by lightning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She... loves Herman Moss? She once said she'd love me forever! But now, the one she loves is Herman Moss!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a sudden surge of pain in his heart, and the pain spread to every corner of his body in ripples.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... love Herman Moss?" he murmured, tightening his five fingers around her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell scowled. Her wrist was hurting so much but she could not break free. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I love Herman. Can you let go now?" she said coldly. The coldness and estrangement in her eyes stung him all the more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you said you love me! You said you'd spend the rest of your life loving me!" He suddenly pulled her into his arms as if he were holding his most important treasure and was in fear of losing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was caught off guard and leaned against George Gregory's chest, feeling the rise and fall of his chest as well as his violent heartbeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She used to love the way he held her tightly. It made her feel loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she no longer longed for his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory, how dare you say such a thing? I regret that I loved you so most. If only Herman had been the one I loved," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... regret it?" He only felt as if he were being enveloped in constant chills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I regret it. George Gregory, listen well. There's no way I'll ever love you again. The person I love is Herman Moss. You're just a man who betrayed me!" she said with perfect clarity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body swayed, and he fell into a trance momentarily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took the opportunity to push him away and turned to say to Daley Moss, "Mr. Moss, please ask someone to take this man out of the cemetery. I don't want him to interrupt my wedding with Herman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss's eyes glistened before saying, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At his signal, the Moss family's security guards walked up to George Gregory and surrounded him. "Mr. Gregory, please."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They made a gesture, &lsquo;asking&rsquo; George Gregory to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell faced the tombstone again. Her mutilated right hand held the wedding ring as she slowly wore it on her left ring finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory wanted to stop her but was blocked by the security guards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, he could not let Amber Mitchell marry Herman Moss, a dead man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loved her. He had loved her all this while!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't put it on. You can't marry Herman Moss. Simon is your child. He's our child!" George Gregory almost shouted at the top of his lungs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell had already worn the ring on her left ring finger, but she also looked up at George Gregory with a shocked expression at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's true. Simon... My son, Simon, is the child you saved when you donated your blood the last time. He isn't Louise Mitchell's child but mine and yours!" George Gregory only tasted bitterness in his mouth as he said this.</p></div>
