        <h1>Chapter 4405: How to Describe It?</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Calvert held his breath, deeply afraid that he might have misunderstood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, my proposal is somewhat selfish, only considering myself. So, if it upsets you, feel free to say so. We can think about whether there are other ways for us to get along that suit both of us," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I'm not unhappy, can I really be with you as more than just friends?" he asked excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's like being in a relationship, but... it's not official. So technically, you're not my boyfriend. If in the future, you find someone else you like, you can tell me anytime. There's no need to feel burdened," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In general, there are no restrictions between the two of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No titles, no responsibilities, no demands!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just wanted to know if what she felt for Calvert was truly love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, knowing how he feels about her and still acting this way, it's a bit selfish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm willing!" Calvert hastily said, "I won't love anyone else, the only person I love is you. No matter how you want our relationship to be, I can adapt!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley couldn't help but chuckle, "What do you mean 'cooperate'? Just be yourself like you usually are. But... um, we could be a bit more intimate with each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her smile instantly eased his nerves.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, don't say things like 'never again'. Life is long, who can predict the future?" Harley said, "Just like me, I never thought I'd see the day when I'd break off my engagement with Lornell. But in the end, didn't our engagement still end?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert pursed his lips, silently saying to himself: But he can't, in his life, apart from her, he will never love anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the moment he fell in love, he was incredibly aware of this fact!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen was dumbfounded when she found out that Harley and Calvert were "together".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you dating Calvert?" she asked in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not exactly dating," Harley explained. "It's more like we're hanging out in a dating-like manner, but without the official label of being in a relationship."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, as the heir to the Gu family, if she officially starts dating someone, it would inevitably become big news, and it could even affect the family business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unless one day, she's truly sure that she genuinely likes Calvert, she won't announce they're dating. Otherwise, if they start dating now and </span><span>later</span><span> she realizes her feelings for Calvert aren't romantic, breaking up might negatively impact the business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This would probably be a blow to Calvert, wouldn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps he'll face even more rumors and gossip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, all she wants to do now is to test the waters, to figure out what her true feelings are.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So... there's no commitment, no responsibility, and no obligation. 'Being together' but still able to see other people, right?" Karen asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley pondered for a moment and said, "To some extent, yes. But personally, I'm not a fan of juggling multiple relationships. If he truly finds someone </span><span>else</span><span> he likes, then we can just go back to being regular friends," Harley stated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, aren't you </span><span>guys</span><span> basically friends with benefits?" Karen said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Pfft!" Harley nearly </span><span>spat</span><span> out the coffee he was drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of description is this!</span></p></div>
