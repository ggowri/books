        <h1>Chapter 4369 Don't Let Me Fall Into Hell</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert and Harley started playing various games at the amusement park.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since it wasn't the weekend that day, there were fewer people than usual. However, there was still a queue for some popular activities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Harley was having a blast.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she initially just wanted to fulfill Calvert's birthday wish, once she actually started playing, she realized that she hadn't relaxed like this in a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they played, it seemed as if all the worries she'd been carrying around lately were suddenly set free.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the two of them got off the roller coaster, Harley's legs were still a bit shaky. After all, it had been a long time since he'd ridden one, and this ride was a bit too thrilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert quickly supported her, gently saying, "Be careful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," she said. Harley looked at Calvert, his face as composed as ever. She thought back to when they were on the roller coaster earlier. He seemed particularly calm, even when she was screaming in fright, he didn't seem to scream at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you scared?" Harley couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert said curiously, "Why be scared? The chances of an accident are very low, and it's not like it's going to kill you. There's nothing to be afraid of."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley never expected him to respond like this, "Most people would still be scared even if they knew they wouldn't die. Are you playing this game just to question whether you'll die or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, a normal person didn't think about life and death just by playing a game. Screaming on a roller coaster was more of a physical instinct, wasn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert simply said, "I just feel like I won't die, so I'm not afraid to have fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you find it exciting? Fun?" She asked curiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't find it thrilling, but it's quite fun." He feels content because she's by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what attractions here do you find exciting?" Harley asked. If he didn't find the roller coaster thrilling, it seemed like there wasn't much else in this amusement park that could excite him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing too thrilling," Calvert said, "but it's quite fun."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was indeed a strange answer, but if he found it amusing, then it was probably worth the trip, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you been here before?" she casually asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've been here before," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did you come?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was the day my mother abandoned me," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley abruptly halted, looking at Calvert in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that? For me, it's all in the past. Even if we talk about it now, I won't feel so upset anymore," Calvert said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really not upset anymore?" she asked, a bit uneasily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mmm</span><span>," he said, "I was once very upset. That day, she dressed me up really nicely and took me to the amusement park. She bought me the toys I wanted and the food I craved. I was truly happy, feeling like I had the whole world. When I got home, I fell asleep joyfully. But when I woke up, I couldn't find her anywhere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's voice was deep as if he was just talking about something very ordinary.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Harley's mood began to sink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She gave me a beautiful dream, only to show me the harsh reality that follows. It was then that I understood what it means to fall from heaven to hell," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry for bringing up those memories again," Harley said, biting her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You haven't done anything wrong to me, it's just..." His voice trailed off, his gaze falling on </span><span>her face, "I just hope that you won't give me a beautiful dream only to then plunge me into hell. That would be too painful for me!"</span></p></div>
