        <h1>Chapter 698</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she was left with was embarrassment back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had not been here since.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew the staff's respectful attitude toward her was not because she was Grace but because the man behind her was Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was the reality of it. Many people in this society would climb on the bandwagon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she hoped that one day, people would look her in the eye not because of who was behind her but just because of herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, Grace chose a purple gown. This gown was very simple in design. Although the design was relatively conservative, it gave people a sense of elegance and demure. The combination of crushed diamonds and lace at the waist and skirt brought out a sense of etherealization that helped the gown from feeling too rigid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of the staff was about to say something when Grace chose the gown, but Manager Wang stopped him with his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only when Grace entered the fitting room did the staff say, "Manager, didn't Miss Lindsay have her eyes on this same gown? Miss Lindsay said she&rsquo;d come to try it on today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what if she fancies it? It's not hers. Besides, the crown prince hasn&rsquo;t acknowledged Miss Lindsay's identity, but this one..." Manager Wang tutted. "Young Master Reed ordered us to entertain her well and to let her buy whatever she likes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, the staff immediately fell silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Grace came out of the fitting room wearing the gown, lighting up the eyes of everyone there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The gown was a great foil to Grace's disposition. The purple color&rsquo;s elegance and calmness seemed to mix well with her water-like serenity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had a comely face with no makeup on, and her hair was simply tied up. Although she was just standing there and looking at people quietly, the others could not help but put their eyes on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Immediately, Manager Wang seemed only too eager to use all his praises on Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Naturally, Grace would not take Manager Wang's exaggerated praises seriously, but... The gown was indeed nice, and it fit her just right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take this one then," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, Miss Cummins. Please come this way. Mr. Reed told us to reserve some jewelry so that you can see which set you&rsquo;d like," said Manager Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace followed Manager Wang out of the fitting room and was walking down the corridor when Grace stopped in her tracks suddenly because the two people walking toward her happened to be her acquaintances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian and Stella Lindsay!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay's eyes immediately widened at the sight of the gown Grace was wearing as she immediately shouted, "Why are you wearing my gown?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your gown?" asked Grace as she raised her eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I had my eye on it!" Stella Lindsay now looked at Grace with envy in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought the gown looked elegant. She specially brought Brian here today hoping to impress him by wearing the gown in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not think she was any worse than those female celebrities!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect Grace to be wearing the gown and... She looked so beautiful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, you're not going to take my gown, are you?" asked Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head to look at Manager Wang. "Is this gown hers?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Manager Wang was moaning and groaning to himself right now.</p></div>
