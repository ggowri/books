        <h1>Chapter 3784</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Daniel kept blaming others for everything and never thought he had any problems, which made her angry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What did you say? How can you say that about me? If it weren't for Mason..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if Mason didn't give you the money and make you make that choice, according to your previous thoughts, didn't you hope to continue dating me and then have the Barlow family or the Reed family help you get through your difficult life? You never thought about changing your situation through your own efforts, but relied on others to help you." Veronica said, "Everyone has their own difficulties. In this world, there are always people who are more difficult than you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel became angry, "What's wrong with my way of thinking? You haven't experienced the hardships I have, so what right do you have to criticize me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Everyone has their own difficulties," Veronica said calmly, "I've seen what you wanted to show me today. I don't think we need to continue talking. I'm going back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica finished speaking and turned to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't go, I haven't finished yet!" Daniel tried to grab Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as he reached out, he was suddenly kicked by a force and he cried out in pain, falling to the ground in a sorry state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica turned abruptly at the sound, only to find that Mason had come over without her noticing. He had his foot on Daniel's back, and his handsome face was icy and intimidating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Daniel, I underestimated you. Did you want to die by bringing Veronica to a place like this?" His voice was cold, but filled with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel coughed and struggled to stand up, but Mason pressed down harder on his back with his foot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason!" Veronica shouted, "Don't do this! If you hurt Daniel, you'll be responsible too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why shouldn't I do this?" Mason glared at Veronica. "He brought you here without permission. What's wrong with me teaching him a lesson?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you want to teach him a lesson, you don't have to do it like this. Besides, we're in a hospital." Although there weren't many people around, someone might come by and see them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what? He should have thought about the consequences before doing what he did today!" Mason grabbed Daniel's hair and slammed his face into the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was stunned. This violent side of Mason made her feel unfamiliar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In just a moment, Daniel's face was covered in bruises and cuts, and blood was flowing from his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, let him go! You have to stop the bleeding now!" Veronica finally found her voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you worried about him?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm worried about you! Let him go and we need to stop the bleeding immediately!" Veronica urged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I tell you that you don't need to worry about me, even if I beat him to a pulp, would you just stand there and watch?" Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was stunned. "What do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha... Veronica, now you see. This is the mindset of the wealthy. Do you really think he's so innocent? People like him only know how to use money to solve everything. You and him are completely different types of people. You'll never be together..." Daniel struggled to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after saying this, what awaited him was even more intense attacks from Mason.</span></p></div>
