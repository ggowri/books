        <h1>Chapter 1771</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, I've forgiven you!" Grace said solemnly, wanting to ease his regret, pain, remorse, and guilt... Was that not why she did not want to tell him the condition of her hands? "I&rsquo;ve really forgiven you, so stop blaming yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He looked blankly at her. She had forgiven him so earnestly, but he was still heavy-hearted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You didn't know me back then. I was just a nobody to you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;Would she still&hellip; forgive me for the things I did after meeting her? Does she know that Hua Stella would never have been able to impersonate her if I hadn't tampered with things?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Whatever that happened afterward would never have happened. Brian wouldn't have misunderstood her because of Hua Stella's schemes, and Brian would have immediately helped her when Lina was seriously injured and admitted to the hospital!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She wouldn't have begged me and married me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She wouldn't have fallen into the sea, lost five years of memory, and lived such a hard life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'My actions not only changed my and Brian's fate but also... her's!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian met Lily in the detention center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily was a little surprised. "I didn't think you'd come and see me. I heard you were on the hill too. Were you trying to save Grace as well? But it&rsquo;s pointless even if you risk everything for her. Jason is still the one Grace loves. You&rsquo;re overestimating yourself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I admit that." Brian smiled faintly. "I came to see you just to find out what happened when Grace fell into the sea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, he could not find out the details from the Reed family. The only information he had was from the official announcement the Reed family gave, which was that Grace had fallen into the sea due to an accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The cause of the accident was entirely unknown!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The only person who could give him an answer was probably Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily sneered. "I knew it. You only want to see me because of Grace! Do you think I'll tell you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sean is seriously injured and would have died without medical treatment, but Jason asked the hospital to save him. It seems that he&rsquo;s bent on keeping Sean alive at all costs," Brian said out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily's expression changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You must be familiar with Jason's temper too. If someone is indebted to him, he'll want them to pay it back tenfold. You and Sean are doomed to be in prison, but you have a child, William. Although Sean isn't his father, you're his biological mother. What do you think Jason will do to the child?" said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily was silent as her hands almost unconsciously gripped the hem of her skirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A long time passed before she said, "Will you protect William if I tell you the truth, no matter what it is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"As long as the child doesn't do anything that threatens Grace and her three children, then I can protect him," said Brian.</p></div>
