        <h1>Chapter 1137</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina had been here several times before, so she was quite familiar with the temple. She brought Grace with her and bought incense and paper ingots in the temple before heading to one of the halls nearest to the temple&rsquo;s entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was an incense burner at the hall&rsquo;s entrance. Grace followed Lina and lit the incense before putting the incense into the incense burner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as the two were about to enter the temple hall, Grace heard one of the people burning incense behind them saying, "Did you hear? Jason is here too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason? The Jason... from the Reed family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Which other Jason would come here and have so many security guards conduct such inspections at the temple&rsquo;s entrance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace trembled. She had thought that perhaps since his name was being kept in the bottom of her heart, she would never hear that name again after leaving the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect to hear the name again so soon! They were... even in the same temple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina naturally heard this too and immediately looked at Grace somewhat awkwardly. "Why don't... we go back as soon as we finish worshiping the Buddha statue?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said with feigned nonchalance, "Don't worry, I'm fine. So what if he's in the temple too? Does it mean that I have to quickly leave Emerald City and move to another city if he's in Emerald City? Since we live in the same city, there's always the possibility that we'll run into each other at some point."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Grace grabbed Lina and walked into the temple hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were a total of four Buddha statues in the temple hall, and Grace worshipped them all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart that was somewhat confused after hearing Jason's name had suddenly calmed down when she walked into the temple hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe it was because of the atmosphere in the temple hall. It was so quiet. Everyone was just quietly worshipping Buddha.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had any wishes, she hoped that God could bless Lina with happiness and that Kyla and Nelson could be together without ever having to separate. As for herself, she had nothing to ask for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After walking out of the temple hall, Lina took Grace to the other temple halls to pray. Just as they arrived at the last temple hall&rsquo;s entrance, many security guards were guarding outside. A temple monk was telling everyone that the abbot was receiving an important guest and the temple hall would not be open to the public for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly had a hunch that the guest inside must be Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're almost done for today. Since the last temple hall is closed to the public, let's go," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay..." Lina responded quickly, also guessing it was probably Jason in there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when they were ready to go, several figures suddenly walked out of the hall. Jason was one of them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only glanced at the figure for a moment before subconsciously turning around in an attempt to leave. However, several pilgrims behind her began to rush into the temple hall after the no-entry sign was removed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stumbled and fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace!" Lina quickly cried out as she tried to pull Grace who had fallen to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, pilgrims were walking quickly around them. Although they would avoid Grace, who had fallen to the ground, Grace could not get up at once.</p></div>
