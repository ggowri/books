        <h1>Chapter 3081</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was about to turn around, Brian suddenly grabbed Valda's hand and said, "Valda, I was serious just now. I love you, really love you. Besides you, I can never love anyone else in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda stared at the person in front of her, then looked at the hand he was holding, feeling a sour sensation in her nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know you were serious just now, so I really appreciate you for saying these words to me. It meant a lot to me and made me feel satisfied. But Brian..." She paused, trying to make her expression look normal. "You don't need to say anything about not being able to love anyone else in the future except for me. You will definitely meet a good woman in the future, and I will bless you, really."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His pupils suddenly shrank, and he looked at her in shock. After a while, he hoarsely asked, "Do you think that what I said just now...wasn't true?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... want it to be real. I want to believe those words are true. So... please don't make me say things I don't want to say, okay?" Valda murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, Brian's heart sank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, she didn't actually take these as his sincere words. "Do you think that I said these things to you because of guilt or self-blame?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But her expression had already given him the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian took a deep breath and placed his hand on Valda's shoulder. He said solemnly, "Valda, listen to me carefully. I, Brian, will never fall in love with someone out of guilt or self-blame. Moreover, I promised you before that I will never lie to you again. There will be no more lies between us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned, he... loves her? Does he really love her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But even though he spoke those words, Grace didn't feel reassured in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her leg, and the decision she made back then... "Brian, do you really think that you're only saying these things because of guilt and self-blame?" Valda murmured, "Because I saved Jasmine, you transferred the guilt and self-blame you had towards Grace onto me, and because my leg was disabled, your guilt and self-blame became even deeper. That's why... you pity me and are willing to say that you love me." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's expression was pained as he listened to Valda's words. He knew that what she said was true. He had been carrying the guilt and self-blame for so long that it had become a part of him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, Valda," Brian said, his voice filled with regret. "I never meant to hurt you. I just... I didn't know how to deal with my own feelings." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at Brian, her eyes filled with understanding. "I know," she said softly. "But you need to let go of the past, Brian. You can't keep carrying this burden forever." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian nodded, his eyes filled with determination. "You're right," he said. "I need to let go of the past and move on. And I want to do it with you, Valda. Will you be by my side?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda smiled, her heart filled with warmth. "Of course," she said. "I'll always be by your side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I said it's not true!" he exclaimed urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" She bit her lip and clenched her teeth. "Even when I was healthy, you didn't fall in love with me. Now that I'm disabled, you claim to love me. It seems even more unreal. Brian, I know you're a responsible person, and I think you're trying to make up for something. But it's okay, everything that happened before was my own choice, and it had nothing to do with you. You don't need to feel guilty or responsible for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian suddenly felt a sense of weakness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seems like the person in front of him has gotten stuck in a dead end, convinced that he feels sorry for her out of sympathy and guilt. What can he do to make her understand that it's not the case?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I want to rest, is that okay?" She said, feeling a bit uncomfortable and avoiding eye contact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment of silence, he said, "Okay, I'll take you to your room." He wanted to carry her, but she insisted on walking slowly by herself.</p></div>
