        <h1>Chapter 1801</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked up at her and said, "Grace, you&rsquo;ll never be a burden to me. You&rsquo;re my everything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her heart jumped. This man was so deeply in love with her. It was the same five years ago and the same five years later!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She moved out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Do you want a glass of water or go to the bathroom?" he asked as he got up and walked quickly to her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nothing, I just&hellip; suddenly want to touch you,&rdquo; said Grace. Although the bandages on her hands had been removed and she only had to apply some scar-lightening cream on the wounds every day, her fingers were still unable to move. She also needed to stimulate the nerves in her hands with slight electric currents every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where do you want to touch? My face?" asked Jason as he gently took Grace's hand and pressed it against his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His cool cheek touched her warm fingers, and he gently rubbed his cheek against her palm. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She always made him feel warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was the one who depended on her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason slowly moved Grace's hand along his jaw, then to his neck and collarbone. Finally, he unbuttoned his shirt with one hand, while his other hand took hers to stroke his chest where his heart was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's face turned red. Although she could not move her hands, it did not mean that she could not feel any sensations. Her hand could feel the temperature of his skin. She seemed to feel the beating of his heart too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm all yours. You can touch me wherever you want," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She seemed to feel that she was on the brink of having a nosebleed. &lsquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he know his words can make people's imagination run wild?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where else... do you want to touch?" His voice was cold but with a unique huskiness that seemed to mesmerize others. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace only felt as if her body was heating up. He seemed to easily evoke her desires.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay..." She could not help calling out his name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes were enthralling. "Grace, do you want to touch me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes." The word just slipped out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next moment, he picked her up in his arms and placed her on the large hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She appeared slimmer on the white bedsheets. Her injured hands made her look pitiful and delicate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason gently kissed Grace on the forehead. "Grace, I love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I love you just like how you love me," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's eyes dimmed slightly. 'Does she know how much I love her? Does she... love me as much as I do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If so, how great would that be?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He should be content with how things were. As long as she loved him, it did not matter even if she did not love him as much as he loved her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His fingers tenderly unbuttoned the hospital gown she was wearing, and he put himself on top of her...</p></div>
