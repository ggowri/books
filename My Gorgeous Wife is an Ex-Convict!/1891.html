        <h1>Chapter 1889</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Madam, you can go over and see if Young master Reed is there," said Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Uncle Kwan, thank you!" Grace said as she jumped to her feet and ran out of the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you going now, Young Madam?" Uncle Kwan was shocked. "It's too late now. Why don't you go tomorrow..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I want to see Jay as soon as possible!" said Grace. She could not wait to see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll have the driver take you there." Uncle Kwan said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A few minutes later, a black car slowly drove away from Reed Residence. Grace kept praying that Jason was really there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Every day had been a torment for her these days. She kept thinking about their conversations and what they did at the freeway and the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said he would not forgive her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It sounded emotionless when he said it. It was only a robotic statement, but she felt excruciating pain every time she recalled it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">How disappointed was he to tell her such a thing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That man loved her so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the car pulled up to the gate of the old mansion, Grace was stopped by the security guards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm Mrs. Reed, and I want to enter!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sorry, no one is allowed in without Young master Reed's permission," the security guard replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So is Young master Reed inside?" Grace asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The security guard was about to reply but he suddenly came to his senses and gathered himself before saying, "Young Madam, please go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the look on the security guard's face told Grace that Uncle Kwan was right. Jay was inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I want to enter!" Grace said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Madam, please don't put us in a difficult position. Without Young master Reed's orders, we can&rsquo;t let you in!" he said with a grimace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace ignored him and just took a deep breath before walking to the iron gate. She looked inside through the bars as she stood there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She once stayed here for a week. It was then that she learned the story of Jay's great-grandfather and great-grandmother. The tragic love affair ended with the end of one person's life and the other spending the rest of her life in this old mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had gotten emotional after listening to the story, only thinking that the relationship was too tragic and the two missed out on too many chances! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace stood there with a determined look on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As long as Jay was inside, she would stay here. If he would not let her in, she would stay here until he came out! She wanted to see him no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The scene of her standing at the door was captured in the surveillance video inside the mansion. When Terrence learned that Grace was standing at the entrance, he immediately reported it to his boss.</p></div>
