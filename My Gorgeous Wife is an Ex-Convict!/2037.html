        <h1>Chapter 2035</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why are you in a daze?" Hadwin Stephenson asked as he approached Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just think you... look like the male leads in idol dramas," muttered Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson smiled and raised his hand to gently stroke her cheek. "I'm your own male lead. I only want you to concentrate on me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His gaze was like a dense web that she did not want to break free from.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once they reached tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau, the two of them took their queue number and sat on chairs to wait. Lina took a photo of the interior hall of the marriage registry office and sent it to the chat group with Grace, Kyla, and herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina: [I'm getting my marriage license today.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, Grace replied in the WeChat group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace: [??? You're registering with Hadwin Stephenson today?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina: [Yeah, we're waiting in line right now!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace: [That's a happy occasion. Let's set a date to celebrate it!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla: [Lina, congratulations! I hope you and Hadwin Stephenson will grow old together!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina: [Thank you. By the way, Kyla, is Nelson's hearing aid ready?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla: [The hospital informed us to collect it tomorrow.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace: [Kyla, I'll go with you tomorrow.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina: [I'm going too.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace: [You're pregnant, so you shouldn&rsquo;t be going to the hospital so much. I'll accompany Kyla and Nelson tomorrow.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina: [Then I'll book a private room in a restaurant and we can have a meal together. Consider it a celebration of my marriage!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace: [Sure. Kyla, are you okay with that?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla:[Yes, let's celebrate Lina's marriage tomorrow!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After the chat ended, Kyla smiled. Lina had found happiness, and she was happy for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She used to think Lina was in the same situation as she was in the past. When Lina and Hadwin Stephenson broke up, she was heartbroken and sorry for Lina. It was great that it ended this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Did something good happen?" asked Mrs. Corbyn as she looked at her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla smiled. "Lina and Hadwin Stephenson went to register their marriage today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina is lucky to meet a man like Hadwin Stephenson," said Mrs. Corbyn. She once heard Grace say Hadwin Stephenson only broke up with Lina to save her, not for power and wealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, she's a lucky woman, and she&rsquo;ll continue being lucky," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn hesitated and said, "The matchmaker in the neighborhood asked me if I wanted to find you a boyfriend again. She has some nice men she&rsquo;d like to introduce you to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, didn't I say that I don&rsquo;t want to find a boyfriend? I want to stay with Nelson and raise him until he's an adult," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But you're alone without a partner. I'm worried," said Mrs. Corbyn. She was getting older and had no idea how many years she had left to live. Nelson was young, and her daughter was only in her 30s but did not even have a boyfriend. How could she not worry?</p></div>
