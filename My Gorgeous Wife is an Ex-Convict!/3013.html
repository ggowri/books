        <h1>Chapter 3011</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Where else can she go besides these places when she's usually at the villa?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A feeling of unease spread through his body once again, accompanied by a rapidly increasing heartbeat. He couldn't even remember the last time he had felt this panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Has Valda really not gone out?" Brian asked the servant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's right, Miss Theller hasn't gone out, not even downstairs," the servant replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian froze. In other words, she was still upstairs?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So he opened each room one by one, searching for her figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But when he reached one of the rooms, he suddenly stopped in his tracks, his face showing a hint of hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This room was...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, she couldn't possibly be in this room! He reassured himself in his mind. But the feeling of unease grew stronger, and even his breathing became labored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand trembled as he gripped the doorknob. After a while, he finally mustered up the courage to turn it and open the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And then, a figure came into view, causing his pupils to shrink and his breath to catch in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That's...Valda!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She's in this room!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian only saw Valda standing in front of the wardrobe, staring straight at the clothes inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the wardrobe, there were purple dresses of various sizes, ranging from those for little girls around 8 or 9 years old to those for adults of all sizes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These were the purple dresses he had bought year after year before he found Grace, hoping that one day he would find her and give her these dresses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But he never thought that these dresses would never be given away and would always stay in this wardrobe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And now, these dresses were unexpectedly seen by Valda. What should he say to Valda? How should he explain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian opened his mouth, but found that he couldn't make a sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if his voice was instinctively afraid to say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, his throat finally hoarsely uttered two words, "Valda..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of "Valda" broke the silence like a spell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's body suddenly stiffened, and then she slowly turned her head. Her misty eyes looked at Brian and she said, "Brian, I...I accidentally opened this wardrobe. I'm sorry." Her nose felt sour and she wanted to quickly close the wardrobe door. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know?" he looked at her in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mhm," she bit her lip and said, "I know these dresses are all bought by you for Grace. Purple is Grace's color to you, so you keep buying these dresses year after year."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda sniffed and said, "Don't worry, I won't overthink it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's thin lips were tightly pursed. Although she was so understanding, he was not happy at all.</p></div>
