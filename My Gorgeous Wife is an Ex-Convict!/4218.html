        <h1>Chapter 4216</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words he wanted to say got stuck in his throat, nearly choking him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, who is my husband and the child's father?" Tina suddenly raised her hand and grabbed Chandler's sleeve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her trembling hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With her current physical condition, he could easily free himself from her grasp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, it felt like there was an invisible barrier holding him back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Adam's apple moved, and after a while, he said, "I will tell you in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to know now!" Tina insisted, her breathing becoming more rapid, her fingers gripping his sleeve turning white.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really want to know?" he asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" she replied with absolute certainty. "Since this concerns me, I want to know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler remained silent. Even though she had lost her memory, even though she had forgotten her past feelings for him, her personality hadn't changed. She was still the same Tina deep down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina preferred the truth and disliked being deceived, even if it was a well-intentioned lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But should he tell her the truth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should he tell her the truth when she was so physically weak?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What would be the consequences, and could he really bear them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a long silence, he slowly uttered, "It's me, Tina! Your husband and the child's father is me, the person you once loved, and it has always been me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina didn't know how she got through that night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since Chandler revealed all these facts to her, her mind had gone blank, and everything she had previously known was being overturned in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she was her parents' child, after all, the middle-aged couple who had looked at her with worried yet longing eyes in the hospital room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Kit wasn't the person she loved, nor the father of her child. Her husband and the child's father were both this man named Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said that at their wedding, she fell into the water and was swept away by the current.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said he had been searching for her all this time, unable to find her, and he was nearly driven to madness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even said that she was the only person he had ever loved in his life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He showed her many photos of their time together, as well as news articles about the Stephenson family and the Hunter family searching for her after she was swept away, making her unable to doubt everything he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could Kit have lied to her?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still couldn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, during the time she spent with Kit, he had been so good to her. She could feel the tenderness and affection in his eyes.</span></p></div>
