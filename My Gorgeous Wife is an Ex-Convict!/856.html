        <h1>Chapter 855</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because... that would not lead to anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like when someone wanted to make her a scapegoat as the powerless her could easily become an abandoned pawn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A flash of embarrassment came over Chase Harper's face, but he said with great certainty, "I... I know I can't do much, but... but if I had known you then, I would have done everything I could to help you! '</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car had come to a stop at the building of Grace's law firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace leaned over slightly and looked at the man next to her carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man looked ordinary, but he had a power that warmed people's hearts. After going through so much, she knew that perhaps ordinariness was the most precious of all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Chase Harper, you're a nice person and a good man, but I'm not right for you. I've been through a lot of things and I've been disappointed in love and in marriage. I just want to focus on my career now. The rest doesn't matter to me!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I can wait. I'll wait until you&rsquo;re willing to focus on relationships and marriage!" As if with great courage, Chase Harper reached out and took Grace's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He held her hand so firmly and his eyes were so clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These hands were completely different from Jason's, but they made people feel warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... "Don't, because there's no point. Chase Harper, you're a good person, but a relationship requires effort from both parties, not just one. You're great, but I don't love you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper's face gradually turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that her words next were only going to get crueler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Knowing that she was an ex-convict from the beginning, he respected her, never looked down on her, and stood up for her when many were mocking her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was great, and there were qualities in him that she thought were noble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she really chose to be with him, then maybe she would spend the rest of her life in a plain but sweet way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought he would make a very good husband too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, just because he was a nice man, she did not want to be emotionally indebted to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Clearing up any confusion might be the best thing for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because I don't love you, it doesn't matter how long you wait. If I love you, I'll even marry you tomorrow," Grace said word after word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every word made Chase Harper's face paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We... can slowly develop feelings for each other. I&rsquo;ll work hard to give you a bright future," he said. He left the Sanitation Service Center and started a business in hopes of being successful so that he could get a chance to win her over!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But sometimes, some feelings just won't develop no matter how much time you've put in," said Grace as she unbuckled her seat belt. "You're great, but I don't love you, so don't waste your time on me. Really. It's not worth it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace was about to open the door and get out of the car, suddenly, there was the sound of a seat belt unbuckling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper turned to the side and hugged her.</p></div>
