        <h1>Chapter 891</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing the servant entering, Hadwin turned to look at her and shouted coldly, "Get out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes!" The servant quickly put down the bowl of soup and left the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Lina and Hadwin were left in the large living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, get up!" said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" She was drunk, but she could still yell out the word clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop that now. Drink the soup first." He was so patient that his subordinates would have been shocked if they saw him like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never wanted to open his heart to anyone, not to mention coaxing a woman like this. She was the only exception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin... What do I do? I seem&hellip; I seem to like you&hellip; Uh... More and more..." she mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew she was talking drunkenly, but he felt as though there was a hard pang to his heart. "If you really like me, why did you go to that show and grab other men's clothes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was helping Grace&hellip; to blow off some steam. Hehe... Besides... they're pretty handsome&hellip; However..." She belched again before taking his face in her hands. "I'm... just looking at them... You're... the only one I like... I like you so much, so so much..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she kissed him on the cheek like those drunken perverts in movies and TV shows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he could not bear to push her away and allowed her to do whatever she liked to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could smell alcohol in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would have hated it if it had been anyone else, but she could never annoy him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said &lsquo;I like you so much&rsquo; again and again as she kissed him repeatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, tell me you love me," said Hadwin. It was as if he could only feel at ease when she said so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised her head slightly, and her round eyes seemed intoxicated. Then, she grinned, revealing her cute little canine teeth that tugged at his heartstrings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course&hellip; Uh... I love you, Hadwin!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His large hand grabbed the back of her head as he kissed her hard on the lips. He wanted her to love him and be more affectionate with him than anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was his suffering and fluke. He only hoped he could grow old with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The ringtone of Lina's phone woke her up. When she opened her eyes, she caught sight of Hadwin's handsome face and... the way the two of them were wrapped in the sheets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." She was startled, then pain shot through her head. She let out a whine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does your head hurt?" His voice rang in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," she mumbled pitifully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, a pair of large hands touched her head as long fingers began to rub gently at her temples.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Lina felt more comfortable. She glanced over at Hadwin's body. Although both of them were still wrapped in the sheets, it did not prevent her from looking at his body that was exposed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'His muscles&hellip; Tsk, tsk&hellip; They make my mouth water!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did we... have sex?' Lina blinked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was a grown woman. She could see what had happened without Hadwin telling her.</p></div>
