        <h1>Chapter 817</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could get to Jason, she was already stopped by Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get out of the way!" Lina wanted to get around Terrence, but how could Terrence let her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina could not get close to Jason after trying for a long time. Therefore, she said to Hadwin who was slowly getting out of the car, "Hey, come and help me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin stepped forward but looked at Jason and said, "Master Reed, my girlfriend wants to take Grace home. Please ask your subordinates to let her pass."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pursed his thin lips and did not say anything. His eyes were still on the body of the person in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, why are you holding Grace? Don't forget, it was you who wanted to break up with Grace! You f*cking broke up with her, so why are you still holding her?" cussed Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the sight of Jason, her mind flashed back to the image of Grace sitting alone at the bus stop, lonely and sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, rich folks like you can date and break up whenever you want, but poor folks like us can only endure it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You treat love like a game, but have you ever thought about Grace? If you've thought about her, even just a smidge, you wouldn't have done this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sean had hurt her so much. Then, she was falsely accused and got put into prison. She finally got over it and now you have to give her another blow?&rdquo; Lina said angrily. She had gone to Reed Residence to scold him last time, but she did not manage to see him then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face became paler and paler. Terrence became more and more terrified as he watched the scene, fearing that Master Reed would lose his temper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who dares to scold Master Reed like this these days? Only this woman, Lina, dares to.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence somewhat admired Lina for her courage to scold Master Reed for her friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let them through," said Jason after some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence side-stepped to get out of the way, and Lina rushed forward. Looking at her best friend who had already blacked out in Jason's arms, she quickly pulled her out of his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um.. Don't move... Don't pull me..." Grace shouted with her eyes closed. She seemed to be trying to squeeze into Jason's arms too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, let's go back!" Lina said hurriedly, then she said to Hadwin, "Come and give me a hand with Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin raised his eyebrows but held Grace's other arm as per Lina&rsquo;s orders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he was holding Grace, he obviously felt Jason's eyes on his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin showed a smile of amusement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that even after the breakup, Jason still minded another guy touching Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as they were about to turn around and walk toward the car while holding onto Grace, Lina suddenly paused in her tracks and turned around to face Jason. Then, she raised her hand and gave Jason a loud slap across his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You owe Grace this!" Lina had her chin up and said indignantly with a desperate look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyway, she was prepared to be hit when she slapped him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though her face was about to be beaten to a pulp, she wanted to vent her fury. The man had no idea how much damage he caused to Grace by breaking up with her so randomly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It might even make Grace afraid to love again for the rest of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she slapped him, the air around them became silent suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence gasped heavily and looked at his boss' face which had darkened instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Lina is out of her mind! Even if she's Grace's best friend, Master Reed will not let her off so easily!'</p></div>
