        <h1>Chapter 1177</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Were you thinking of Jason?" asked Brian. He could have not asked, but his pride made him ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned and kept quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her silence made it clear to him that his guess was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if you still have Jason in your heart, I'll wait until you get over him and fall in love with me," muttered Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not that I haven't gotten over him. I no longer have such feelings for him." Grace denied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If that's the case, all the better." Brian chuckled. "Maybe my wait will be shorter that way. Grace, you don't hate me, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips. 'Hate? How could I hate Bryn?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Brian's phone rang suddenly. He picked it up, and his expression changed slightly after he listened for a while. He said in a deep voice, "Okay, got it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once he ended the call, Brian looked at Grace with a straight face and said, "We've found out who&rsquo;s the mastermind behind the accident."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Grace was surprised. "So soon?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But it wasn't my men who found out about it. It was Hadwin Stephenson. He found out more quickly than me. The mastermind has been arrested by the police and is undergoing further questioning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who's the mastermind?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Elizabeth Jackson, the bride the Stephenson family arranged for Hadwin Stephenson. Elizabeth Jackson probably intended to kill Lina, but you happened to be in the same car with her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The name rang a bell with Grace because she had heard about this woman from Lina. Elizabeth Jackson had even deliberately sought out Lina to scare her. She even wanted to force Lina to leave Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is... taking a life that easy for some people? You can easily get rid of the people you want to kill with a car accident?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A chilling sensation surged through Grace's body due to fear and anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know which police station Elizabeth Jackson was taken to?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian gave the address of the police station. Grace stood up and said, "I'm going to the police station. Get some rest, and I'll visit you next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned around, and before she could take another step, Brian grabbed her hand. "When's the next time?" he asked with his chin slightly raised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"To-Tomorrow. I'll come and see you after work," she said after thinking about it for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay. I'll wait for you tomorrow!" Brian smiled. The indifference in his gentle eyes dissipated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace was on her way to the police station, she called Lina and learned that she and Hadwin Stephenson were already at the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time Grace arrived at the police station, the statement about Elizabeth Jackson had come out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Following the clues Hadwin Stephenson provided, other than catching Elizabeth Jackson, the police had also caught three people who were paid by Elizabeth Jackson to help her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three men quickly confessed, so Elizabeth Jackson let down her defense and confessed to her crime as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Elizabeth Jackson's opinion, since Lina would not take the easy way out, getting rid of Lina was the most effective way. As long as Lina was gotten rid of, she could naturally marry Hadwin Stephenson and become Mrs. Stephenson.</p></div>
