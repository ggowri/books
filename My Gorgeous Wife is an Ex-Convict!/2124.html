        <h1>Chapter 2122</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, neither of them spoke on the way back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's car arrived in front of the store. Mrs. Corbyn asked as soon as she saw that her daughter was back, "What took you so long? You've been gone the entire day. How was the pregnancy check-up? Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, Mom," Kyla said with her usual smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay? Are you going to hide it?" asked Martin Weiss. Then, he told Mrs. Corbyn what had happened at the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn instantly became deeply worried. "Is there any danger? Then... Then what should we do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Mom, please advise Kyla not to have the baby. Her health is important. If she wants to have another baby, then... Then I can adopt a baby with her. Anything else is possible but this. I just don't want anything to happen to her again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn ignored that Martin Weiss kept calling her &lsquo;Mom&rsquo;. She looked at her daughter nervously and said, "Martin has a point. Why don't you give up this baby..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, it's too early to make such a snap decision before the doctor's consultation. I&rsquo;ll regret it for the rest of my life if I kill this baby prematurely when I had the chance to bring them into the world." Kyla looked at her mother and said, "Mom, you don't want me to regret it for the rest of my life, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn could only sigh heavily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said, "What if the situation still isn&rsquo;t optimistic after the consultation? Are you still going to have the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then let's see how bad it is!" replied Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss was instantly overwhelmed with regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss rarely did anything he regretted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If treating Kyla like that back then was one of the things he regretted, then knocking her up after getting drunk was another thing he regretted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If he had known she would get into such danger after getting pregnant, he would never have knocked her up. He even... tried to stop her when she tried to abort the baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss just wanted to slap himself hard, and he did!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace saw slap marks on Martin Weiss's face when she saw him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did Kyla do that?" asked Grace. After all, in her opinion, only Kyla would be able to leave slap marks like that on Martin Weiss's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I did it myself," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was at a loss for words all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said, "I came to see you today because I need your help with something. If you're willing to help me, I&rsquo;ll spare no effort to help you or the Reed family whenever you need me in the future! Take it as though I&rsquo;ll owe you a big favor. What do you think?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was rare for the head of the Weiss family to say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace frowned. "If you want me to help you with something related to Kyla, then I'm afraid I can't help much." She thought he wanted her to help him put in a good word to Kyla and bring him and Kyla back together.</p></div>
