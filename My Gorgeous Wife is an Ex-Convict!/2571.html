        <h1>Chapter 2569</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stepped out of the hospital. Once she reached the hospital&rsquo;s entrance, she hailed a taxi to leave. A figure slowly walked out from behind her and watched the taxi drive away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory smiled bitterly. He had done nothing and just coldly looked on back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He now wanted to do something, but she was unwilling to accept him. Simon was now the only connection between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two days later, Philip Barlow was surprised to receive an invitation from George Gregory. They were both in Deer City and had business deals together, so he dared not refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory's sudden invitation made him curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The venue was an exclusive club in Deer City. By the time Philip Barlow arrived, George Gregory had already set up a table full of fine wine and delicious food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You didn't ask me here today just to dine with me, did you?" Philip Barlow asked as he raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's to thank you. Thank you for saving Amber Mitchell," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow's eyes glimmered. "You don't have to thank me. I was just doing someone a favor. If you really want to thank someone, you should thank the Reed couple of Emerald City, Brian, and... Amber Mitchell's best friend, Kyla. They're the ones who helped Amber Mitchell!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said bitterly, "I will. I&rsquo;ll thank them for helping Amber Mitchell!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He spoke as he filled his and Philip Barlow's wine glasses. "But I'd like to thank you no matter what. Amber Mitchell would probably have suffered a little longer if it weren't for you. I'll down my drink to show you my gratitude!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory raised his wine glass and drank it in one gulp, then another one. He drank three glasses in a row.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow picked up his wine glass and drank from it as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems Amber Mitchell is your son's biological mother," said Philip Barlow. Although there was no word in the news about who Simon's biological mother was, the answer was not hard to guess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said sarcastically, "Yes, it's Amber Mitchell. It's funny that I didn't know that until now. What's funnier is that I found out I&rsquo;ve been kept in the dark. Everything I believed in turned out to be wrong!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Better to know now than never to know at all, no?&rdquo; Philip Barlow asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory smiled bitterly. For a moment, he did not know which was better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me about Amber Mitchell's condition when you saved her. Tell me what you know," said George Gregory. All he knew was what was said in court and nothing else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had gone to the mental hospital to see her even once, many things might not have been dragged on until now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow said, "What's the point of finding out now? It&rsquo;ll only make you feel worse about yourself. Some things are better left unknown."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said, "But I want to know about it. Even if it&rsquo;ll only make me more miserable, it&rsquo;s... the pain that she went through. I didn't protect and save her, so I deserve to suffer now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow sighed and finally told George Gregory what he knew.</p></div>
