        <h1>Chapter 2162</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace hesitated for a moment before shaking her head and saying, "I still don't believe that kid could do something like that. I&rsquo;ll find evidence no matter what."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you still going to defend the boy even if the evidence leads to William in the end?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She looked at him. "What are you trying to say?" They were husband and wife, after all. She could tell that he was trying to hint at something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said, "Now that this has happened, let Philip Barlow take William away. Everyone will be happy then, right? Grace, you only brought William back to the Reed family because he had nowhere to go. I didn't object to it, but I can't say I approve of it either. After all, he's Lily's son."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, he paid extra attention to William even though he was only a child, fearing that the child would blame the Reed family for his mother's death and hold a grudge against them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Isn't this the perfect opportunity to give William back to Philip Barlow? Returning to the Barlow family will do the boy no harm but good,&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace pressed her lips together. Of course, she knew William could not stay with the Reed family forever, and the Barlow family wanted the child back now. It was only natural for the child to return to the Barlow family, but... "Even if William does go back to the Barlow family, he's not going back like this. I must get to the bottom of this! If he's innocent, then I&rsquo;ll clear his name,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's expression changed slightly. He knew she was probably reminded of how she was wronged back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With a sigh, Jason grabbed Grace and pulled her into his arms. "Okay, if you think he's innocent, then I hope the child won&rsquo;t betray your trust."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day, Grace went to the hospital to see Nelson first. Nelson spent the night in the hospital for observation. There was nothing wrong with him, and when the test reports came out, everything was normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was finally relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, I'm sorry for what happened yesterday, but I have a feeling that something else is going on, so I want to ask Nelson some questions to get to the bottom of this," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla also said, "I asked Nelson afterward and he said William did try to push him. But William didn't push him toward the stairs. He tried to push him the other way. He accidentally lost his footing on the stairs when he dodged William."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was doubtful. 'The other way?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nelson, did you hear anything when William pushed you yesterday?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn frowned and shook his head. "No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No particular sound?" Grace asked again without giving up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn carefully recalled before shaking his head. "I really didn't hear anything. I was wearing my hearing aids at the time. I would&rsquo;ve been able to hear it if there was a sound."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's heart sank. 'Was William lying?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But... the kid didn't look like he was lying when he said that.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If a five-year-old was telling a lie, there was no way an adult could not notice it unless they were already a good liar at such a young age!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Grace went to Lina's place again after leaving the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once she reached the mansion, Lina asked Grace as soon as she saw her, "What the hell happened yesterday? Did William really push Nelson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace roughly told Lina what she knew. "What do you think is going on here? Was there a sound?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina frowned. "We were on the first floor while Nelson and William were on the stairway. Logically speaking, there was no way the three of us could have missed it if there was a sound on the stairs at that time!"</p></div>
