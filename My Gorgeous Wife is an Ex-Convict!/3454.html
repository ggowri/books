        <h1>Chapter 3452</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A few days later in the evening, when she returned home, she found her father, stepmother, and younger brother sitting in the living room with serious expressions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he saw her return, her father fixed her with a cold, unwavering stare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad? What's wrong?" asked Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you dating any of the boys from school?" Archer asked sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was surprised, "Dad, how come...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How do I know? Your younger brother saw that guy walk you home, and I even went out of my way to check the surveillance footage from nearby stores. Turns out that guy has been walking you home almost every day! So, what's the deal between you two? Have you slept together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's face turned red, she never expected her father to suddenly say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course... there isn't any!" she said indignantly, feeling embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer and Rosalind breathed a sigh of relief. Archer pointed at their daughter and said, "You need to break up with that boy immediately and stop seeing him! I knew something was up when Mason didn't come back to stay with us recently. It's all because of this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica said, "Dad, Mason is staying with the Reed family. It has nothing to do with me dating Daniel. Daniel and I haven't done anything wrong. Why do we have to break up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean you haven't done anything wrong? You're still a student, and dating is a mistake! Anyway, you better break up right away, or I won't forgive you!" Archer said fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica said, "I won't break up. I don't think I did anything wrong!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You...you..." Archer was so angry that his fingers were trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rosalind quickly placed her hand on her husband's chest and said to Veronica, "Veronica, just listen to your father. Do you really want to make him sick with anger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica clenched her teeth tightly, but she didn't admit her mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, what happened next completely exceeded Veronica's expectations. She thought her father would at most pressure her, but she didn't expect him to go directly to the Cross family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she only found out when she was on her way home with Daniel and received a call from her brother Lionel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sis, Mom and Dad went to the Cross family. It seems like they want you to break up with your boyfriend! I've given you a heads up, so remember to say some good things about me in front of Mason in the future!" Lionel said on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the phone call ended, Veronica looked at Daniel with a confused expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" asked Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica said, "It seems like my dad and stepmother went to your house!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel's face slightly changed, "Do they know we're dating?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, before, they didn't approve of us dating and wanted me to break up with you. I didn't agree, but I didn't expect them to go to your house," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, it was the first time she had encountered such a situation, so for a moment, she was a bit confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go back to my house first and take a look," said Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go too!" Veronica quickly added. After all, this matter was related to her and she couldn't let Daniel face it alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel heard the words, thought for a moment, nodded and said, "Okay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them hurriedly made their way to the Cross family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the way to the Cross family, Daniel received a call from his father asking him to come back as soon as possible.</p></div>
