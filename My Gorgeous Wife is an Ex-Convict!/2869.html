        <h1>Chapter 2867</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled faintly. "Really, I don't blame you because you never lied to me." She knew since the beginning that he had another woman in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had also clarified that he did not love her when they started dating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In that case, how could she expect him to run to her first when she and Grace were both in trouble?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pressed his thin lips tightly, his uneasiness growing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller quietly watched the person in front of her as she gently lifted her fingers and touched his brow, nose bridge, and eventually his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone said men with thin lips were heartless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian was not heartless. He had just given all his feelings to another woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller laughed at herself and said to Brian, "I said before that I wouldn&rsquo;t do anything too intimate like kissing you until you had fallen in love with me, but I want to take that back. Can I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian froze. What she said was out of his expectation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she put her hands gently around his neck, pulled him down slightly, and tiptoed to kiss him... "Brian, I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm sorry I&rsquo;m breaking my promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm sorry. I said I'd try to make you fall in love with me, but it's not going to happen now.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller closed her eyes and put all her affection into the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She never thought she could be with a man like him. She loved him, and the love unknowingly deepened until it scared her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more she loved him, the more disappointed she was when she saw him turn away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was upsetting for her to learn that he left her because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps that was what loving someone was all about. The more you loved someone, the more you were forced to endure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then perhaps you would lose yourself one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss ended, Valda Theller slowly released her hands and opened her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She caught sight of his beautiful dark phoenix eyes. They were so stunning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips spoke softly, "Why did you apologize? I should be the one apologizing to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm apologizing because I can't love you anymore." Valda Theller took a deep breath before smiling and saying, "Brian, let's break up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart sank as he felt his limbs freezing. The icy sensation continued to sweep through his body, and his blood seemed to freeze quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want to break up?" He almost squeezed the words through his teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she answered affirmatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" He stared at her. "Don't you love me? Don't you want my love too? If you're upset about what happened today, I can apologize and make it up to you any way you want!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His tone was so eager as if an indescribable panic was running through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "I don't need you to make it up to me. I just don't think I can love you anymore. I think it&rsquo;ll be better for us to break up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean it&rsquo;ll be better for us?" He did not find it better. "Also, do you think you can't love me anymore? So you don't love me anymore?"</p></div>
