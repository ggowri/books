        <h1>Chapter 650</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">First Uncle said through gritted teeth, "Boy, you put us in detention for so long. Why don't you apologize and pay us now? Otherwise, you're going to suffer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not many people dare to make me apologize," Jason said lazily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was confused. 'What's going on? First Uncle and Second Uncle were still afraid of Jason at first, but after what Third Aunt said, they&rsquo;ve changed their attitude completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could it be that Third Aunt's daughter, Stella, has found a backup?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she remembered that Stella ran a small smithy with her husband, earning only a modest income about the same as most of the town's residents. What kind of backup could she have?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, you're not apologizing, are you? Even if you get down on your knees and apologize later, it won't be over that easily!" First Uncle said fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if watching a play, Third Aunt said leisurely, "Grace, as your aunt, I must warn you to ask your boyfriend to apologize to your First Uncle and Second Uncle and make it up to them. You know your Stella is close with your First Uncle and Second Uncle. She wouldn't want to see her uncles getting bullied."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then did Grace realize the way Third Aunt dressed was not the same as before. On closer inspection, her clothes looked well-made and were probably expensive. Besides, she was wearing diamond rings and gold bangles, which made her look like... She had made a fortune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt's voice continued ringing, "Your Stella is not what she used to be. She has a powerful man backing her now. If you annoy her, tsk tsk..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A powerful man?" Jason laughed sarcastically. "That's great. I'd like to meet this powerful man!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who do you think you are? There are some people in this world you can't afford to offend!" Third Aunt glared at Jason, looking as if she would make him regret it later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes narrowed as a hint of anger flashed in his eyes. If this person was not related to Grace and Grace's grandmother had not just passed away, then he would just have this woman admitted into the hospital right now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a step forward, Grace said, "Third Aunt, it's not up to you whether we can offend them or not. Why don&rsquo;t you remind First Uncle and Second Uncle to apologize to me for selling me to the Miller family? I don't think Jason has anything to apologize for, and I don't think they're being bullied at all. They deserved to be locked up in the detention center!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..."Third Aunt's face reddened immediately. "What are you talking about? First Uncle and Second Uncle are your elders! They did that because they wanted you to be safe for the rest of your life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? Why don't we just tell the folks in town and let them judge who's right and who's wrong?" said Grace. Even if they were going to have a falling out, she was not going to let First Uncle, Second Uncle, and Third Aunt insult Jason today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">First Uncle and Second Uncle looked at each other. This town used to be a village, so everyone knew each other very well. Although some outsiders knew about them trying to marry Grace into the Miller family, the matter was done under the table. If it came to the surface, it was clear who was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They would probably be ashamed to stay in this town!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt was so angry that she raised her hand and was about to slap Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During this period, their family had suddenly become rich because her daughter met a powerful man. As such, she quickly became arrogant and got accustomed to the pursuit as well as the flattery of others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, the way her niece was talking to her greatly embarrassed her, so she wanted to give her a piece of her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could slap her, someone intercepted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" cried Third Aunt, feeling as if the bones of her wrist were about to be broken. "Let... Let go... Let go..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared at Third Aunt with a murderous look growing in his eyes.</p></div>
