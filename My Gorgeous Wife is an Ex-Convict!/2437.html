        <h1>Chapter 2435</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's lifeless eyes instantly seemed to burst with hope. Her lips quivered as tears quickly filled her eyes. "Okay... I... will cooperate. I will... cooperate!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right as she was done speaking, large teardrops rolled down Amber Mitchell's cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took out a tissue and wiped away Amber Mitchell's tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Judging from the conversation earlier, Amber Mitchell must be at least partially conscious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, Amber Mitchell asked in a mutter, "Is Kyla... alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's doing well. She started a store, her son is now in primary school, and she's pregnant with her second child. Her second child will be born soon, and her wrongful conviction has been overturned as well. The real perpetrator has been punished," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell listened with a flash of comfort in her eyes. Then, she whispered, "That's good..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, have a good rest. You&rsquo;ll be evaluated by the doctor when you get to the doctor's place. There&rsquo;ll be many things to do then," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell nodded and slowly closed her eyes. Her hands, which were at her side, clutched the hem of her dress tightly. She knew this was her chance. Perhaps... it was her last chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had to seize this opportunity no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Half an hour later, in the Mitchell family's residence, Louise Mitchell, who was already asleep, received a phone call from the mansion's head of security.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she was impatient at first, she felt her head buzz and explode as soon as they told her that Amber Mitchell had disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? She's gone? How could she be gone?" Louise Mitchell barked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... we're still checking," the person on the other end of the line said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Checking? Don't we have a security system? Don't we have someone watching the surveillance around the clock? Aren't there a lot of people keeping watch? You assured me everything would be alright! And now you're telling me that you're still checking?" Louise Mitchell just wanted to fly to the other side and slap them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... someone hacked into the security system, and the mansion's power supply was suddenly cut off. The backup power didn't come on in time because of a programming glitch. When we reconnected the power supply, we discovered that they&rsquo;ve already left the mansion," they replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell said through clenched teeth, "Do you know who took her away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're... not sure yet." They gave Louise Mitchell another answer that would make her explode.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">''Not sure? You don't even know who took Amber Mitchell away!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who on earth did it? Who would take Amber Mitchell away? In the eyes of others, Amber Mitchell is just a mental patient now!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The faces of Grace, Kyla, and Martin Weiss suddenly flashed across Louise Mitchell's mind. She had met the three at the hospital. Later, she even met Grace at a party.</p></div>
