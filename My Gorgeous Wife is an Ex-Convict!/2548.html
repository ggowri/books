        <h1>Chapter 2546</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was tired after going through so many things. She just wanted to spend the rest of her life in peace and keep those wonderful memories with Herman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell walked to a row of bookshelves in the room and looked at the books on the shelves. These were Herman's favorite books, and she saw a book she once loved among them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was surprised to find the same book in Herman's book collection. However, she found a photo tucked between the pages when she opened it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... a photo of her and Herman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the photo, she was looking up and talking to Herman, seemingly about an interesting topic. She had a smile on her lips, while Herman listened with a gentle expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a photo of them together, but it was a photo that was taken secretly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell remembered that this photo was one of the first photos of her and Herman taken by the paparazzi, which later sparked rumors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she told Herman about the incident, Herman had joked, "Speaking of which, we haven't taken any photos together. These reporters had helped us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yeah, they had never taken photos together!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it why Herman printed out this photo?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was indeed a photo of them together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Herman...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's eyes watered as she looked at the gentle face in the photo. The next moment, warm tears began to surge out of her eyes, dripping onto the photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell quickly raised her hand and wiped the tears from the photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Knock! Knock!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of knocking rang. Amber Mitchell got up, walked to the door, and opened it. She saw three women standing outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, I'm the stylist responsible for your dressing tomorrow. These two are my assistants. Mr. Moss asked us to discuss with you and try on some makeup. We can make the changes today if there are problems," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the stylist and her two assistants went in and got busy. They helped Amber Mitchell put on the wedding dress and let her try several styles before she chose one of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Whitney Herrera came over. She had brought a set of jewelry with her. She said, "Daley Moss said his parents had prepared two sets of jewelry for their two daughters-in-law when they were alive. Mine was given to me when Daley Moss and I got married. This set is for his eldest brother's wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Amber Mitchell opened the jewelry box, she saw an expensive set of sapphire jewelry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell quietly caressed the jewelry before looking up and saying to Whitney Herrera, "Thank you. I'll wear the jewelry tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll return it to you after that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, Daley Moss wants you to keep the jewelry. Since you're set on marrying his eldest brother in such a way, it&rsquo;s the most appropriate for you to have it," said Whitney Herrera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked beautiful and serene when she wore the wedding dress. She had her hair up and wore makeup. She donned the sapphire jewelry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Amber Mitchell right now, even Whitney Herrera, a woman, could not take her eyes off her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was undoubtedly beautiful! Even after being tortured in a mental hospital for so many years, she was still beautiful. Whitney Herrera could imagine how beautiful she used to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No wonder George Gregory and Herman Moss fell in love with Amber Mitchell!</p></div>
