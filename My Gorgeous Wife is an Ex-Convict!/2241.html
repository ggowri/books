        <h1>Chapter 2239</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Someone I like...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you like Mommy, Daddy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I like her very much," muttered Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then why did you hurt Mommy like that back then?" Nelson was only nine years old now, but he was not as young as he was back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss rubbed his son's head. "Because I was stupid. I was so foolish. I liked your mommy, but I wouldn't admit it. I thought I could prove I didn't like her by hurting her, but it was the stupidest idea!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, he said, "Nelson, if you ever fall for someone, don't avoid your feelings as I did. Cherish that person instead. It's not easy to meet someone you like in this world. Perhaps you'll only meet a person like that once in your life. When you miss the chance, you might live in pain and regret forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like his situation now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn listened carefully. Of course, he had no idea how much this would affect him in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Nelson Corbyn returned to the store, Martin Weiss smiled bitterly and returned to the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss slowly started the car and left once the store&rsquo;s lights went out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wished he could turn back time and not do so many stupid things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He repeatedly broke Kyla&rsquo;s trust, eventually making her scared of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he only lived for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could give her his body and blood. As long as she was safe, he could also sacrifice his life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman went to Kyla's store again the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she saw Kyla, Jacqueline Bowman could not help but complain, "Kyla, why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you were Martin Weiss's wife? I was even worried about you not being able to get anything from Martin Weiss because you had an awkward identity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at her indifferently. "I just thought it was not worth mentioning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you not have a good relationship with Martin Weiss?" Jacqueline Bowman looked as if she wanted to pry into the matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of answering, Kyla asked, "What are you doing here today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman chuckled drily. "I was worried about you. I saw Mr. Lambert approaching you and saying those things in front of so many people yesterday. I was so worried. I even thought of standing up for you. Fortunately, Martin Weiss was there to defend you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Jacqueline Bowman seemed to say casually, "By the way, the Reed family's young madam, Grace, said you're the godmother of her children. Are you close to the Reed family too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said indifferently, "We're alright. Jacqueline, I'm going to be busy with the store later. Why don't you go home first if you have no other business here?"</p></div>
