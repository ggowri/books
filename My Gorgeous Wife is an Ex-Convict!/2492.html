        <h1>Chapter 2490</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was because she seemed gentle and polite, but there was a hint of calculation in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, we'll talk here, then," Grace said, wanting to see what she was trying to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper looked at the two bodyguards beside Grace and said reluctantly, "I don't want other people to hear what I'm going to say to you, Mrs. Reed. Why don't we talk about it somewhere else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That will be difficult because my husband has arranged many 'other people' around me to protect me. Even if we go somewhere else, they&rsquo;ll still be there and hear whatever you have to say," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper's eyes glimmered with displeasure, but it quickly disappeared. Her face showed a sad expression. "Well, I hope you can cut off his yearning for you once and for all. You have a happy family now. You have two sons and a daughter. Surely, you don't want Brian to suffer alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Whitney Cooper said with feigned self-mockery, "I know I'm only your substitute rather than a secretary to Brian, but I truly love Brian and wish him well. But there are so many things I can't do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at the woman in front of her. Although she seemed modest, polite, and concerned about Brian, Grace had met many people over the years. She could see that the woman had ulterior motives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what do you want me to do?" she asked nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wish you&rsquo;ll say some ruthless things to Brian to make him give up so that he can truly move on," said Whitney Cooper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And what good will it do you?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Me? Of course, there&rsquo;s nothing in it for me&hellip;&rdquo; Her eyes flickered as she answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace chuckled. "I see. I thought you&rsquo;d gain something out of it and that&rsquo;s why you especially came to see me.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm only doing it for Brian's sake. I hope he won&rsquo;t dwell on the past anymore. Mrs. Reed, will you agree?" Whitney Cooper said with expectant eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper thought that as long as Grace spoke harshly to Brian, Brian would be hurt and depressed again. She would then take the opportunity to comfort him and even find a chance to sleep with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she were lucky enough to get pregnant, she would have a bright future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I got it," Grace said indifferently. With that said, she went past Whitney Cooper to get into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Huh? Is that all? Did she agree? She&rsquo;s not going to say anything else?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper subconsciously tried to stop Grace but was stopped by Grace's bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mrs. Reed, are you really going to make things clear to Brian?" Whitney Cooper asked in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whether I do is between him and me. You're just a secretary, so do what secretaries are supposed to do," said Grace before looking back at the face similar to her younger self. "I&rsquo;ve never thought that one person should be another person's substitute. Everyone is their own individual."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper bit her lip slightly as she complained in her head, 'Anyone can say nice words like that!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could only be a substitute if she wanted to stay with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, a substitute like her would win over Brian's heart sooner or later!</p></div>
