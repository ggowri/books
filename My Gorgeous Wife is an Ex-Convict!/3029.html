        <h1>Chapter 3027</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over an hour passed quickly, and when the plane arrived at Deer Capital, Valda and Brian got off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to having rested on the plane, Valda is in good spirits now. As soon as she left the airport, she looked around curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them took a taxi and went directly to the hotel prepared for the participants of the conference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because the rooms prepared by the conference organizers are all single rooms, some attendees who bring their families with them will choose to upgrade to larger rooms at their own expense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda and Brian naturally upgraded their room to a larger one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although it is a large room, it is still quite different from the presidential suites that Brian usually stays in at hotels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you be able to adjust to living here?" Valda hesitated to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's so hard to get used to here?" Brian chuckled, "I'm not as delicate as you might think."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the word was mentioned, Valda imagined Brian's delicate appearance and couldn't help but chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After packing their luggage, it was already approaching evening. Valda and Brian left the room and planned to find a place to have dinner outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want to eat?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's try some of the specialty dishes from Deer Capital. It's my first time here," Valda said. "Have you been here before? Do you know which dishes are good?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian thought for a moment, then took Valda to an old and well-known restaurant in tMason Swansonty of Deer Capital, where they ordered some of the restaurant's signature dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the two of them waited for the food to arrive, Valda's gaze turned towards the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because the two of them were sitting by the window, she could see the passersby and the scenery on the street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to the hustle and bustle of Emerald City, Deer Capital has a more classical charm with many preserved ancient buildings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During the free time of this exchange meeting, she is interested in visiting the ancient buildings in Deer Capital, as she believes it could bring her some inspiration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Valda's eyes suddenly caught sight of a little boy crouching by the flower bed across the street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Where are the boy's parents? Valda thought to herself, glancing towards the boy's vicinity. There were some people standing around him, but she couldn't tell who his parents were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, the dishes started to be brought out one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go ahead, try Deer Capital's specialty dish. I heard the food here is quite authentic," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda nodded and began eating her food, but her gaze kept drifting towards the little boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, several people walked past the boy, but none of them seemed to be his parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Occasionally, someone would approach the boy and ask him something, but they would soon walk away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could this child be lost? Were there no parents around?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda wondered to herself. However, the boy looked to be around 8 or 9 years old, an age where children usually know their way home and don't need to worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But perhaps it was the look of loneliness on the child's face that reminded Valda of herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After her parents passed away, she was taken in by her uncle, but she never felt at home there. She always felt like an outsider, no matter how hard she tried to fit in.</p></div>
