        <h1>Chapter 2783</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor snapped, "How could you let a girl drink so much? Didn&rsquo;t you stop her? Drinking too much alcohol can lead to accidents. If she felt nauseous and wanted to vomit, she might die if the vomit was stuck in her throat!&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor scolded while examining Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian listened to the doctor's reprimands like an obedient student and did not refute them. He only looked worriedly at Valda Theller. "How is she? Is she okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Looks like everything's okay so far. How much did she drink?" the doctor asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian froze. Speaking of which, he had no idea how much she drank. People were already forcing her to drink when he saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor was instantly flabbergasted. "How about this? Just in case, let's take a blood sample and see what the alcohol level is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," answered Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor prescribed the order for a blood test. Just then, Valda Theller, who was lying on the bed, opened her eyes suddenly. Her drunken round eyes stared straight at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian froze, not expecting Valda Theller to open her eyes. "You're awake?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller grinned at him. The grin looked silly. Though she was looking at him, her focus was a little off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He instantly knew she was not sober even though her eyes were open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, go get her blood drawn." The doctor handed Brian the order for the blood test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian took it. He was going to help Valda Theller, but her hands had already wrapped themselves around his neck. "I... I don't want my blood drawn. It hurts..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It only hurts when the needle goes in. It'll be okay in a minute." Knowing that she was drunk, he explained patiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ouch... Boo-hoo... I... I don't want to have my blood drawn!" she said and began to cry again. The tears on her face were heartbreaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was flustered to see Valda Theller that way. None of the women he dated back then dared make such a scene in front of him. One look from him and they would keep quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was crying and making a scene. He had no idea what to do. "Stop crying... Stop crying. It'll only take a while. If you don&rsquo;t do it, the doctor can't tell how drunk you are."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she kept on crying, and her little head rubbed against his chest like a weak and pitiful animal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian could only say, "Why don't... Why don't I do anything you want after you get your blood drawn?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like how his parents had coaxed him when he was a child. They often granted him a request if they wanted him to do something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed to understand what he said. She sobbed and raised her head. Her tearful round eyes gazed at him. "I want to kiss you, can I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." For a moment, Brian had no idea whether he should agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, hurry and get your blood drawn," the doctor urged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian picked up Valda Theller, walked out of the emergency room, and hurried toward the blood collection counter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they arrived at the blood collection counter, there was no need to wait in line as it was now nighttime. Brian carefully put Valda Theller on the chair at the blood collection counter. Then, he rolled up Valda Theller's right sleeve.</p></div>
