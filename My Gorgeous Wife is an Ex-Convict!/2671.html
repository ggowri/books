        <h1>Chapter 2669</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I love him." Valda Theller used Brian as an excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman pressed his thin lips together. "That man isn't simple, and it's never gonna work out between you and him. Valda, don't make a decision you'll regret just because you're mad at me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said sternly, "I didn&rsquo;t get together with him because of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she pushed his hand away and walked straight out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's pale face was full of agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Have I run out of chances?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller walked out of the room, only to see many people gathered at the front. They were making a lot of noise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller frowned, not knowing what was going on up ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the production assistant walked over to her and tapped her on the shoulder. "Hey, Valda, there you are. The director is looking for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The director's looking for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, the director's over there!" They pointed to the area where the crowd had gathered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller walked over, only to see many people holding boxes of mooncakes with exquisite packaging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is someone at the front... giving out mooncakes?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But Mid-Autumn Festival is still far away, isn't it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she got nearer, she found a long line of people in front of her. Everyone was holding a box of mooncakes. Next to the person handing them out were the director and another woman in a beige outfit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's pupils suddenly constricted, and she stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was... Barbara Schuman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her misery in university started because of this woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman's long straight hair had become enchanting curls. She wore delicate makeup, looking more stunning than she used to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director waved toward Valda Theller and said, "Valda, here. This is Miss Barbara Schuman. I heard you were classmates in university. Miss Li's the sponsor of our TV show. These are the mooncakes her company just released. She said they're for the film crew to try."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, I haven't seen you for a long time. It's so nice to see you again. I convinced my dad to sponsor the TV show because I learned that you're the original comic artist. Consider it a way to cheer you on," Barbara Schuman said with a smile. The smile looked so gentle and amiable. Others would think she was on good terms with Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda Theller still remembered how Barbara Schuman had asked Raymond Bowman to make her the laughing stock of the whole school. Besides that, she had even looked at her like a high and mighty judge when she was bullied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The girls who often bullied her were friendly with Barbara Schuman. They even dragged her in front of Barbara Schuman, kicking her and stepping on her hands.</p></div>
