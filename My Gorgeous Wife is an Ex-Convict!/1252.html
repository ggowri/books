        <h1>Chapter 1251</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." The staff was put on the spot. He knew exactly who Stella and her companions were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this Miss Cummins must be a woman of high standing. After all, he had just seen her arrive in a Bentley, which was not something ordinary citizens could afford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella moved her red lips and smirked. "Grace, I'm sorry. My friend is straightforward and hates scheming women. As you know, high society hates scheming people like you who would frame others to reach your goal the most. My friend has a lot of friends in high society. If she publicizes this, I'm afraid this shop will go out of business!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though Stella was speaking to Grace, her words were for the staff nearby to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her coldly. She had already told Brian the truth he wanted to know that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, judging from the way Stella behaved, it was clear she did not know that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had Brian not asked Stella yet? However, it no longer had anything to do with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stella, I didn't expose you for impersonating me before, but that doesn't mean things will stay the same. You can continue with your lies, and I'll also fight this case for my friend. When the time comes, we'll see who's the scheming one who framed others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had only been tolerating her cousin because of her grandmother, her patience had now been exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Stella's face reddened as she felt guilty. She did not expect Grace to talk about the impersonation in public. Sure enough, the two rich ladies around her who had been sucking up to her recently showed an expression of wanting to know more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, I can't let Grace talk about it anymore. If Grace says more about it, it&rsquo;ll spread to high society even if Brian doesn&rsquo;t believe it. My reputation will also be affected!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Stella said to the staff nearby, "Hurry and kick her out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several staff members looked at each other. Just then, the same staff member who had gone to get Grace's dress came over with the dress in their hands. "Miss Cummins, would you like to try on your dress?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Dress? Haha. Who are you to wear the dresses here?" Stella reached her hand out and threw the dress to the ground. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Stella was about to step on the dress, Grace suddenly snapped. "Stella, if you dare to step on it, I swear I'll never let you live in peace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was immediately startled. Grace looked just like how she knew her, but something was frightening about her when she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there were so many people around that Stella stubbornly said, "So what if I step on it? It's just a stupid dress. I can afford to pay for it even if I step on it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't afford it!" Grace's voice was cold, and even her normally gentle almond-shaped eyes were exuding an intense chill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a dress Lina had prepared for her, and no amount of money could compensate for it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Stella's face turned even redder, full of embarrassment.</p></div>
