        <h1>Chapter 228</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking that she had been wronged and bullied on the set today, he was in a bad mood and was anxious to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that he saw her, his mood was even worse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his hand and flicked the bruise on her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ouch!" Grace could not help but gasp at the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sneered. "Is it painful?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course! She was not made of stone. Of course, it hurt when he flicked her! Especially when he intentionally aimed for her bruise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She glared at him with her almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He laughed angrily. "Great. Great job, Grace. I wanted you to stay with me, but you were quick to refuse. I thought you had a lot of dignity and backbone, but now? Was it fun to be an extra and be bullied into kneeling and groveling non-stop by your sister?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip, subconsciously taking one step back. He was frightening her a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she took a step back, he took a step closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She continued taking steps back until she reached the wall with her back against it. There was no more room for her to evade him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He closed in on her, his hands propped on either side of the wall. He was almost encircling her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I asked you, was it fun?" His eyes were fixed on her, and his voice, deeper than usual, seemed to have a subdued fury in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was confused. She was the one who was hurt and bullied today! Why was he the one angry instead?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... wasn't playing," she grimly replied after a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wasn't playing? What set did you go to? Why did you become an extra? What, do you want to be a star? Why didn&rsquo;t you just tell me? I can make you a star. You can just ask me for anything you want. You don't have to kneel and grovel and hurt your hand like that," he said coolly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If possible, he would have her chained to him so that she could not go anywhere and humiliate herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath, tilted her chin up slightly, and said, "For 330 dollars. I got to earn 130 dollars as an extra, and I got another 200 dollars by kneeling and groveling to Evelyn repeatedly. That's why I became an extra, alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He paused for a moment. "330 dollars?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, 330 dollars!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You did that for only 330 dollars? Why didn't you come to me for money? I'll give you as much as you want. I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll have to pay something in return for your money, right?" Grace said. She just did not want to get involved with him anymore. She wanted to go back to the old days when she did not know him. It was too lonely to be alone in the house back then, but she was not a game.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I don't want you to pay?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then there's no need for it. You don't have to give me any money. I can earn my living," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He snorted. "Do you have to get yourself into this mess to earn your living?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gasped. A trace of gloom flashed in her eyes. Then, she slowly lowered her eyes and muttered, "At least I earned this money with my own abilities, and I don't need to be afraid of anything."</p></div>
