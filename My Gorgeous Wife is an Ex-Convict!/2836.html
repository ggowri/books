        <h1>Chapter 2834</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian finished putting on the earrings for Valda Theller. The person in front of him was ordinary at first, but she became more beautiful the longer he looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are her makeup and hair done?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She hasn't put on her shoes," the makeup artist said, and their assistant quickly took the shoes that had been prepared for Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll do it," Brian said as he took the shoes from the assistant and crouched in front of Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, I... I can wear them myself," Valda Theller said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his chin slightly and looked at her. "Let me put them on for you. It's easier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was sitting in the chair, and he crouched in front of her. When he lowered his head to help her put on the shoes, it made her feel as if she was Cinderella and he was Prince Charming putting the glass slippers on her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's right. Other people think I'm Cinderella and am lucky to have caught the crown prince's eye. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he finished putting on the shoes for Valda Theller, Brian said, "Take a couple of steps to see if they're tight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller got up and walked for two steps before saying, "They're fine, but the heels are a little high. I'm afraid I'll fall if I lose my footing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grab my arm so you won't fall," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip slightly and muttered, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, it's almost time. Let's go." He reached out his hand and took hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller followed Brian into the car, and Brian said, "Why are your palms so sweaty? Is it hot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's not hot. Miss Song and her friends came in just now, and I... I was kind of scared. So..." With that said, she lowered her head in embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pondered for a moment before saying, "I'm sorry I scared you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said as he pulled out his handkerchief, took her hand, and gently wiped the sweat from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was so gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated and said, "Will you think I'm useless?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I think you're much braver and stronger than I thought. You managed to intimidate those people even when I wasn&rsquo;t around. The next time someone says something that upsets you or tries to do anything to you, mention my name," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... You heard that?" She felt even more awkward now. He knew how she tried to intimidate them with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I heard you tell them I love you very much," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I made that up. I hope you don't mind." She lowered her head more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Why would I mind? I hope I can fall for you sooner. Next time, you can also tell them I&rsquo;ll be distressed if anyone hurts you, and I&rsquo;ll make them pay back a hundred or a thousand times over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze before suddenly looking up blankly at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you say that, then I think few people in Emerald City will dare to lay a hand on you," he continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt as if her heart was weighed down by something. She knew he said it for her own good, but... it also meant that she would further expand the lie in front of people to protect herself.</p></div>
