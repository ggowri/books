        <h1>Chapter 327</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her arm was caught the next moment. Then, with a jerk, she fell into a wide embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She unconsciously wanted to break away from his arms, but his hands closed around her and held her closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What a perfunctory good night, Sis!" he muttered as his lips were close to her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body trembled a little, and she could feel his breathing on her ears. Her whole body seemed to be enveloped in his breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... Let go," she said, her face turning red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you tell me about your first day at your new job first?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a regular delivery job. Someone orders something, and I just deliver it to them," she said, feeling her heart beating faster and faster. Even her blood flow was a lot faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? Did you have a good meal today?" His voice once again rang in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I ate with the boss. She provides two meals a day." Her face was heating up as if it was going to burn. The strange sensation made her panic. All she wanted now was for him to let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not give her what she wanted. He turned her face over so that she was facing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you nervous?" he said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... No." She denied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your face is so red." He laughed softly. Then, he bent down and softly pressed his lips against her cheek. "Are you blushing because of me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&hellip; no." She was so stiff that she stammered a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're lying." He hissed, but his voice sounded more like he was spoiling her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip, trying to push him away, but her hands that were pressed against his chest seemed powerless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it fear? Was she afraid that she could not bear the consequences of pushing him away? Or was there something else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, Grace could not tell why but her mind was in a blur.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, he finally let go of his grip. He gently stroked her lips and smiled as he said, "Well then... Good night, Sis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace almost ran for the hills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she got back to her room, she put her hands over her burning cheeks. She could not tell whether her face or her hands were hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was wrong with her? He would often hug her like this, but her reaction to it was completely different from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At first, she had thought of him as family. After knowing his true identity, she began to be frightened of him and would tremble when he held her. What about now? What was this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could it be that&hellip; she had fallen in love with him and had feelings for him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, it was unlikely!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shook her head and tried not to think of that. She and Jason would never get anywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Men like Jason were unpredictable. No one could guess what he was thinking. He might look like he was in love with her now, but how long would this illusion last?</p></div>
