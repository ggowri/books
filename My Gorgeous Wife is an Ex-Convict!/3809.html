        <h1>Chapter 3807</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break up?" This answer clearly surprised Daniel. The next moment, Veronica felt a sharp pain on her scalp as Daniel yanked her hair down, forcing her to tilt her chin up. "Are you trying to lie to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not lying to you," Veronica gritted her teeth against the pain. "I broke up with him after you were hospitalized. So what you're doing now is pointless. If you release me, I won't report to the police. We can pretend this never happened..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Veronica could finish her sentence, Daniel slapped her hard. Her whole body tilted to one side, and one side of her face burned with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Break up? How could you break up? He went to such great lengths to make us break up, and now you and him broke up so soon? Are you playing games with me?" Daniel yelled while kicking Veronica with force.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was tied up and couldn't resist, she could only take the kicks like a punching bag.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was in pain, and her bones felt like they were about to break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Daniel finally stopped kicking and gasped, "Even if you really broke up, I won't let you go. Let's make a bet, let's see if Mason will come to save you. If he doesn't come, I'll throw you into the sea and see if he regrets it for the rest of his life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica spat out bloody saliva, "Why... why do you have to do this? You're only ruining your own life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My life has already been ruined!" Daniel said irritably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You still have parents, don't you care about them? What will they do if something happens to you?" Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Them? I've already made arrangements. Anyway, I'll have a lot of money, and I'll start my new life abroad! As for you, whether you can survive or not depends on what Mason will do." Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica suddenly froze, what did Daniel mean by that? What was the big sum of money he was talking about? Did someone pay him to do this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what was the purpose of the man who paid him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Veronica heard the sound of a phone taking pictures. Was Daniel taking pictures?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was he doing, and where was she now? She couldn't move and couldn't see what was happening around her. She couldn't do anything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that all she could do now was wait!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Come to think of it, this wasn't the first time she had been kidnapped. She was once kidnapped because of her half-brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only that one time when she was kidnapped with Jasper, and later, the Reed family mobilized a lot of people, with Mason even coming to rescue her personally.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she was still wearing the necklace that Mason gave her, which had a locator device that allowed Mason to know her exact location.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what about this time? This time she was kidnapped alone, would the Reed family still go to great lengths to find her? Although Auntie Grace and Uncle Reed were good to her, she was not part of the Reed family after all.</span></p></div>
