        <h1>Chapter 3301</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda took a deep breath, looked at the empty bed next to her, sat up, lifted the blanket, put on her slippers, and walked out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just think, at times like this, Brian is probably in his study again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As expected, when she reached the door of the study, it wasn't tightly closed and there was a light on inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda gently pushed open the door and saw Brian sitting at his desk, browsing through his computer and then flipping through the documents on his desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound of her entering seemed to startle him. He looked up and turned towards her, asking "Why are you awake?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My leg cramped up and it woke me up in pain," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing her words, he quickly stood up and walked over to her. "Please have a seat, I'll give you a massage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, you focus on your work first," she hoped he could finish his work early, go to bed early, and not waste time because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rub it." He insisted, because it would make her legs feel more comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing how determined he was, she had no choice but to go along with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although most of the time, he will comply with her opinions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But once he is determined, it is often her who surrenders in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda sat on the sofa while Brian skillfully lifted her leg and rested it on his thigh. "Which leg is cramping?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The left one," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then his fingers pulled up the cuff of her pajama pants and he began massaging her slender calf.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It must be said that his massage was just right and very comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although her leg was no longer painful after the cramp, being massaged like this was still a kind of enjoyment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only regret was that her calf was a bit too thick now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to swelling in the late stages of pregnancy, she felt her calf was becoming more and more like a radish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My leg looks so thick compared to your fingers," Valda sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thick? " Brian didn't think so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Too fat." She said, women always care more about their weight. "Since I got pregnant, I've gained 20 pounds."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially since she hasn't reached full term yet, the later stages of pregnancy will cause her weight to increase rapidly. It's estimated that she'll gain around 30 pounds by the time she gives birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're not fat, you're very cute," said Brian. As he spoke these words, his expression was sincere and his eyes were so gentle that they could almost make one feel emotional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is it sweet talk or beauty in the eyes of the beholder?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was pondering in her mind and then said to Brian, "Do you know that with your current expression and saying such things, it makes me feel like I'm experiencing a drama like an idol show?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" He raised his eyebrows. "If you don't like it, then tell me what kind of expression you like on me." He was willing to change for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He can do anything that she likes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I don't," Valda shook her head. "I really like it." His expression was almost seductive, which made her feel the urge to pounce on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, the sad truth is that she is currently facing two major obstacles. Firstly, she has the desire but lacks the ability to achieve her goals. Secondly, the objective circumstances are not in her favor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But with that expression of yours, it's only meant for me to see," she said.</p></div>
