        <h1>Chapter 3658</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, when Roger discreetly glanced at Jasper's position, he found that there was no figure there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she left!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She left so decisively, just like back then. Nothing has changed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, after hearing the conversation between him and his mother, she left with just a few words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger continued to drink glass after glass, telling some jokes that were neither here nor there to those around him. But he knew that his heart was not here at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Roger and his friends came out of the bar, a figure stood in front of him. "Do you have time to talk to me alone now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger paused and looked at the person in front of him in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The cool moonlight fell on her, highlighting her slightly pale face. Her hair was slightly messy from the evening breeze, but her eyes were so clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What...?" Roger asked in astonishment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I waited for you. You were busy drinking with your friends, so I waited for you to finish." Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, "So, you've been waiting all this time?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," she replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His expression was complicated. That meant she had been waiting for him for over three hours.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he had never thought that she would wait for him on purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Roger, are you leaving?" Roger's classmate shouted at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at the classmates who were already walking ahead, then looked at Jasper and said loudly, "You guys go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those boys whistled a few times, their faces showing a hint of ambiguity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After those people walked away, Roger said to Jasper, "It's so late, and you still insist on having a 'private' chat with me. Do you really think William won't suspect </span><span>anything?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What would he suspect?" she asked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes were too clear, so clear that all conspiracies and calculations would be exposed in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He chuckled and bent down, blowing a breath on her face. With a teasing tone, he said, "He would suspect that you're interested in me, that you're playing both sides. Don't think that men are always magnanimous. Especially William, he's not a magnanimous man."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper said seriously, "I only see you as a friend. I don't have any other intentions towards you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" He looked at her with a slightly hazy gaze due to the alcohol. "Do you really have no feelings for me? Or is it because you think I'm not as attractive as William?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him. The person in front of her was undoubtedly good-looking. His clear and cold face had a touch of charm due to the alcohol.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew he was very popular at school, but their relationship was not like that for her and Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are an important person to me, someone I will always remember. But that's friendship, and it's different from how I feel about William," Jasper replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Friendship? So your feelings for William are love then?" he said with a hint of amusement. "If it wasn't for William being surrounded at the school gate that day, and you wanting to help him out, would you have said you were dating him? I don't think so! If you really loved him, you would have loved him a long time ago, not just now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Roger's emotions began to rise. Even his tone became angry and indignant.</span></p></div>
