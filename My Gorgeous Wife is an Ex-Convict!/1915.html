        <h1>Chapter 1913</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace realized that Katherine Jackson seemed unusual. It seemed that she had no intention of escaping and was abandoning herself to despair. However, she might actually be looking for another chance to escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason looked at Katherine Jackson coldly. "Take off my clothes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, take off your clothes and don't leave a single piece of clothing. After you take off your clothes, take a selfie and post it online. If you get more than 10,000 likes in a minute, maybe I'll let Grace go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was pure humiliation! She was playing Jason like a monkey!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, no!" Grace said as she fought back the pain from the continued blood loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Jason had already raised his hands and started to unbutton his shirt. One, two... He continued to unbutton them until he pulled the shirt off to reveal the thin undershirt underneath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was silence as if nothing else could be heard except for the sound of the helicopters&rsquo; propellers overhead and the movement of air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's subordinates looked at their boss as he took off his shirt. He was beginning to unbuckle the belt around his waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, stop... Stop it! She's just... just fooling you... She's not really..." Grace said with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's belt was now off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We won't know if it's true until Young master Reed does what I ask of him. Grace, I envy you. Look, Jason is willing to go so far for you!" Katherine Jackson said grimly with undisguised jealousy in her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Why would a man like Jason go this far for Grace? Few men could bear the indignity of being naked in front of their subordinates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason was so powerful too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson was feeling smug. Now that tMason Swansonty's most powerful and wealthy man had to obey her orders, it was as if she already had tMason Swansonty under her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she felt sad at the same time. Why was Jason and Hadwin Stephenson willing to humiliate themselves for women, yet she could not even find a man who loved her that much?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At that moment, Katherine Jackson looked at Jason and fell into a trance. Jason pulled out the belt around his pants at that instance and whipped it at Katherine Jackson's hand that was holding the dagger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson noticed that something was wrong but it was too late for her to react. The dagger in her hand immediately fell to the ground, and Grace took the opportunity to use all her strength to knock Katherine Jackson away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't think you can escape. Nobody can escape..." yelled Katherine Jackson as she reached for her pocket. However, there was a muffled groan in the next moment and Katherine Jackson fell to the ground. On her back, blood began to rapidly spread, staining her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">One of the five helicopters that had been circling overhead had its door opened...</p></div>
