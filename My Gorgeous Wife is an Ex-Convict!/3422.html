        <h1>Chapter 3420</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel seems a bit awkwardly saying, "You didn't hit us, so why are you apologizing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I am his sister. I apologize on his behalf. Besides, this whole thing started because of me," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really think he's your brother?" Daniel asked with a strange expression on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These days, he had naturally heard more gossip about Veronica and Mason's relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's expression changed, "I don't know what you think, but for me, Mason is my family, he's my brother!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, Veronica turned and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel was stunned for a moment, then hurriedly caught up and stopped Veronica, "I'm sorry, I'm not..." He seemed to want to explain something, but then realized that explaining anything would only make things worse, so he didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them stared at each other for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Daniel finally managed to say, "I believe you. You and he are just siblings. Actually, I should thank you. Last time when your brother was about to beat me up, you rushed out and stood in front of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was also the first time he had been protected by a girl. It was strange, but this scene had been unconsciously appearing in his mind these days, making him unable to forget it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's expression softened when she heard him say this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm just too sensitive," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you and your brother must have a deep bond," he brought up a topic, "I heard from classmates at school that he lives with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, he's been living with me since we were very young," she said, "so we've been together since we were little..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe it was the sincerity on Daniel's face that made her unconsciously say these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Actually, when I was a kid, I always wanted a little brother to play with me!" Daniel sighed, "In kindergarten, I once brought a little boy from the nursery class back home because the kindergarten I went to and my home were in the same neighborhood, very close. As a result, my parents were shocked when they saw me bringing a child back, and the other child's parents almost went crazy looking for him, they even called the police..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Daniel talked about his childhood anecdotes, Veronica couldn't help but laugh, as if the scene was happening right in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Daniel actively talked about some childhood embarrassing moments, Veronica gradually relaxed and talked about some childhood memories with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time passed by unknowingly.</p></div>
