        <h1>Chapter 3690</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina said to Veronica, "Veronica, if you don't want to be this person's assistant, just say so. I can ask my dad to help you find a suitable job."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, but not for now," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I see," Tina muttered, "But just now, Mason was helping you, right? I knew it, how could feelings just disappear like that? Mason must still like you. I support you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's words made Veronica feel bitter. She and Mason could never be anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, let's go," Chandler said, pulling Tina away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the onlookers around had already sniffed out something unusual from Tina's words just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who is Veronica and what is her relationship with Mason?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who was previously bowing and scraping to Mason now looks at Veronica with confusion and asks, "Do you know them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica replies quietly, "Yes, I do."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Curious, the person asks, "What is your relationship with them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica hesitates for a moment before saying, "My family has received favors from the Reed family, so I know them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person nods thoughtfully, then looks at the time and urges everyone to go their separate ways since the concert will start soon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everyone leaves, Angelica asks Veronica, "Which Reed family did you mention earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica replies, "The Reed family from Reed Group." Even if she didn't say it, Angelica could have found out from somewhere else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica is shocked and her bad premonition comes true. It really is that Reed Group's Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No wonder the person was bowing and scraping to Mason, and if the person called him Mason, then he must be one of the famous triplets from the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the way, in Angelica's mind, she suddenly remembers the last charity event where Veronica was splashed with a drink and Grand Princess Jasper from the Reed family came forward to help!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that Veronica's relationship with the Reed family is not shallow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, a hint of jealousy flashes in Angelica's eyes. She is just an ordinary assistant, but she has made such a big mistake because of Veronica, almost causing her to be in big trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You did it on purpose!" Angelica suddenly says.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Veronica asks, confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you deliberately trying to make me angry because you know the Reed family will be here today? Are you intentionally playing the victim in front of them to gain sympathy and get more benefits?" Angelica questioned sharply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I didn't think that way, and I didn't know they would come here tonight," Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph!" Angelica snorted, "It's better if they don't. Don't think that just because someone from the Reed family speaks up for you, you can climb higher. It's just a wealthy person's occasional act of kindness. You're just a small assistant, a poor student!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Angelica walked straight back to her dressing room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica stood still, and the cleaning staff came over to clean up the pasta spilled on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whose clothes are these?" the cleaner asked Veronica, who was still standing there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica followed the cleaner's gaze and saw the stained clothes that Mason had taken off and left on the chair earlier. She quickly picked up the clothes and said, "It's my friend's clothes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she knew in her heart that she and Mason had once been so close, but now they couldn't even be called friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p></div>
