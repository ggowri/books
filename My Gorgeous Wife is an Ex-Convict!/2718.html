        <h1>Chapter 2716</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." Kyla shook her head and said, "He could&rsquo;ve lifted his hypnosis at any time because he set the secret password himself. And only he knows what it is. But he refuses to do so, and..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And what?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And he promised me he'll never lift his hypnosis," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. "What do you mean he promised you? Did you ask for it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "You can call it that, but that wasn&rsquo;t exactly it. He didn't want his hypnosis to be lifted at all, and I just said that I hoped he would lift it when I signed the divorce papers in the future. He agreed readily. He did not even have a moment's hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her red lips slightly as she looked reluctant. Would two people who were in love miss out on each other like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla fell silent but then said casually, "Not everything is perfect in life. Perhaps Martin Weiss and I aren't meant for each other. But I won't drive myself into the corner. I'll be fine and raise our two children. Life isn't just about love to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me know as soon as possible if you need anything," said Grace. Kyla was stronger than she thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla quipped, "Okay, I'll ask you for help if anything happens. You won't be able to hide from me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two looked at each other and smiled. Just then, Grace's phone rang. She picked it up, and Lina's voice came from it. "Grace, do you know what I've heard?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her surprised voice sounded as if she had heard something shocking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Just tell me. Don't make me guess." Knowing her best friend's character, there were many things that she would make a fuss about. She might not be able to figure it out even after half an hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without wasting time, Lina said, "I heard Queenie Mack's detention is related to Brian, and he did it for a woman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze. The gossip news that Queenie Mack was detained by the police was from two weeks ago. They had casually spoken about it when she was chatting with Lina. Lina even said Queenie Mack had a backer or something in Emerald City. They speculated that Queenie Mack must have hit a snag that even her backer would not protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that Brian had something to do with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, the woman Brian did it for is Valda Theller." Lina continued to share the gossip she heard. "I heard that Queenie Mack gave Valda Theller trouble, causing Valda Theller to get hurt and hospitalized. Then, Queenie Mack was arrested by the police. After getting out of the detention center, Queenie Mack seemed to have asked her backer for help, but it was useless. Brian made it clear that he wanted Queenie Mack to 'get what she deserved'. No one will help her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How is Valda Theller now?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not sure, but I've heard it's nothing serious. I think Brian's serious about Valda Theller. I heard Queenie Mack's backer is Brian's friend. If he wasn&rsquo;t serious about Valda Theller, he could&rsquo;ve done his friend a favor. It didn&rsquo;t have to be like this," said Lina,</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's great if it's for real," said Grace. It meant Brian was over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Valda Theller looked like a simple woman. Maybe only someone like her could make Brian fall in love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, Kyla asked what had happened. Grace then roughly told her about the call and how she and Lina had met Brian and Valda Theller in the mall the last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked surprised when she heard that. "I didn't expect Brian..."</p></div>
