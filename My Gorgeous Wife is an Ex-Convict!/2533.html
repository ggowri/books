        <h1>Chapter 2531</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't need to?" Louise Mitchell suddenly laughed. "Do you really think I didn't need to do that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips were pressed into a straight line. If the accident had never happened, he would have married Amber Mitchell no matter how much he quarreled with her. After all, he loved Amber Mitchell and wanted to marry her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Was it to marry me or to get Amber Mitchell's shares in Mitchell Group?" George Gregory asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't answer you. If you don't want Simon to have a murderer as a mother and the reputation of the Gregory family to be greatly affected, you'd better find a way to help me win this lawsuit again. It should be easy for you," said Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's eyes narrowed sharply. "Are you threatening me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I'm just telling you the truth. It's in the Gregory family's best interest for me to get acquitted again, isn't it?" Louise Mitchell said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's best for the Gregory family isn't necessarily what I would do. Louise Mitchell, you forgot one thing. I, George Gregory, hate getting threatened the most!" With that said, he turned and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Panic flashed across Louise Mitchell's face. "George Gregory, you&rsquo;ll regret it if you don't help me. You&rsquo;ll definitely regret it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stopped in his tracks and said coldly, "What I regret most is marrying you. You shouldn't be Simon's mother. You don't deserve it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell bit her red lip. 'Regret... He really regrets it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I don't deserve to be Simon's mother. Does Amber Mitchell deserve it, then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He&rsquo;ll never know that Amber Mitchell is Simon's real mother, and Simon will only have to wait to die. It's best if he really dies!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory came out of the detention center and got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver respectfully asked, "Mr. Gregory, do you want to go back to Gregory Residence now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, just drive," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, the driver began to drive around the town. George Gregory turned to look out the car window at the receding street view.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was ridiculous that he had always been conceited but was kept in the dark again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought he was in control of Louise Mitchell, but she had done more than he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought that he would never see Amber Mitchell again and had gotten over Amber Mitchell. However, a great storm still stirred up in his heart when she appeared in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car drove to an empty road and a figure came into his sight, he shuddered instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was... Amber Mitchell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop the car!" he said to the driver almost automatically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the driver pulled up to the roadside, George Gregory realized that it was the spot where Herman Moss and Amber Mitchell's car accident had occurred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was standing at the junction with her head down as if she were looking at something in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory was suddenly curious about what Amber Mitchell had in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost without thinking much, he got out of the car and walked over to Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was so focused on what she was holding that she did not notice someone was approaching her.</p></div>
