        <h1>Chapter 144</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"As long as Mr. Reed agrees, Miss Cummins, you can leave the hospital whenever you wish," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace felt an unspeakable feeling. So, she even needed Jason's consent just to leave the hospital?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay, got it," she replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the doctor and nurse both left, she walked into the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror. Reflected in the mirror was a delicate face on which were a pair of crescent-shaped eyebrows and almond eyes, a well-shaped nose, and pink lips. Under the light, there seemed to be a slight glimmer over her face.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Such a face would be considered pretty good in an ordinary crowd. However, around people like Jason, there was never a lack of beauty, and she seemed inadequate by comparison.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">What exactly did Jason like about her? Grace smiled bitterly. Was it just because he had found her mistaking him as a homeless person at the start amusing? Was that why he had continued to keep up this brother and sister charade?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She raised her hand and gently touched her lips. The memory of him kissing her flashed in her mind.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She still remembered that Lina had once said, "Grace, do you know that your lips are very beautiful?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Beautiful lips?" She had never paid much attention to her lips. She only knew that her lips were not ugly, but she did not feel that they were anything special.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, it's very beautiful. Your lips&rsquo;s shape give people an impulse to kiss you. Uh... it's the kind of that most men would probably want to kiss."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that time, she had only thought that Lina was making fun of her. What kind of a description was that?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, when she thought of how Jason had kissed her on the mouth, she felt a burning hot sensation on her lips.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't think about it anymore, don't think about it anymore!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace repeated this sentence to herself. Since Jason had said that he would give her a choice that day, he would surely keep to his word.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A man like him would not break his promise.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Let's just treat all of this as a dream." It was just a dream. In her dream, she had met a man named Jay. They had cherished each other and had a happy time together. When she woke up from her dream, she was still alone, just like before she had the dream.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace walked out of the bathroom and began to change into the clothes she had been wearing the day she had come to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for the rest, it was just her bag and her mobile phone. There was nothing else.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace sat quietly on the sofa of the hospital room and waited for Jason.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the Reed Residence, Terrence walked to Jason's side and said, "Mr. Reed, Miss Cummins is waiting for you in the hospital room. She said that she wants to be discharged from the hospital."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence's tone was cautious. Ever since Mr. Reed had left the hospital yesterday, he had been staying in the house and had not gone to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It could be said that he was acting abnormally.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It should be noted that Mr. Reed had been mostly staying in the hospital until yesterday.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason pursed his thin lips tightly. After a while, he said, "Other than wanting to be discharged from the hospital, did she say anything else?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No," Terrence said as he watched his Boss's face sink again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence did not dare to utter a word. He simply waited to one side.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason lowered his head and played with a scarf in his hand. Terrence knew that this scarf had been woven by Grace as a gift for his boss.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason casually flipped the scarf over and half-closed his eyes as if he was thinking about something. After a long time, he finally stood up and said, "Let's go to the hospital."</p></div>
