        <h1>Chapter 4327 No One Can Regret</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina is confused, what is the situation? Chandler kissing her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kiss was extremely hot, domineering, and filled with a sense of exclusivity as if it was about to devour everything from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kissed her so hard that she could hardly breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind almost became blank, and after some time, his lips finally left hers. She instinctively breathed in fresh air, and her brain slowly regained its consciousness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? "She asked, staring blankly at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina! "He gritted his fingertips as he slid over her tender lips." In the future, I won't regret it, nor can you. No matter what will happen in the future, I won't let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He gave her the opportunity, and allowed her to escape from herself, time and time again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, this time, he didn't want to give her another chance because now he couldn't really let go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay! "Tina hugged him tightly," Chandler, don't let go of me. No matter what the future holds for me, don't let go of me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she knows that no matter whether there is a memory of the past or not, she wants to be with him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina and Chandler reunited, which is naturally a good thing for both families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hunter family hopes that Tina can conceive a second child as soon as possible, but Chandler is worried, after all, he did not take contraceptive measures the previous night, in other words, she may get pregnant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? If I get pregnant, are you unhappy? "Tina couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It hasn't been long since your body recovered, and if you're pregnant now, the burden on your body is too heavy, "Chandler said. For him, her body is the most important.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I have already asked the doctor, and with my current physical condition, it wouldn't be a problem if I were pregnant, "Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's no need to be in such a hurry. I know you hope to help me solve the problem of the insect pest as soon as possible, but for me, your body is the biggest thing. "He doesn't care how long the insect pest on his body will last.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as she is safe, it doesn't matter even if that insect stays with him for a lifetime!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But for me, your body is also a big deal! "Tina said." Of course, I know that only when I am in good health and can give birth to a child safely, will you be well. </span><span>So</span><span> you don't have to worry, I will take good care of my body and not act recklessly."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you said you won't be fooling around, then promise me not to get pregnant for at least one year. Everything will be decided after one year when your health is better! "Chandler's attitude was extremely persistent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina blinked her eyes, a year later?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That is to say, will he suffer another year of pain?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, pregnancy is a matter of two people, and if he really doesn't touch her, it's not easy for her to conceive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina thought for a moment and said, "Then you also have to promise me that within a year, when your insect attacks, you must tell me and let me be by your side."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler hesitated, and Tina said, "I can get pregnant again in a year, but this year, I don't want to see you suffer anymore. If you hold me, it won't hurt anymore. Why not hold me? If I used to be afraid that I would know the truth, now that I know about the insect, you have no reason to silently endure that pain alone."</span></p></div>
