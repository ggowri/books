        <h1>Chapter 3272</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as these words were spoken, Wilona's expression changed immediately. She realized that her supposed intelligence was already clear as day to others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A layer of cold sweat broke out on Wilona's back, and she was at a loss for words when facing Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Terrence ignored Wilona and got on the car without saying anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the car left, Wilona stumbled to the wall and pounded her chest to calm herself down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Earlier, Terrence was relaying Mr. Reed's warning to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But, after finally climbing up the big tree of the Reed family, how could she be willing to give up if she can't make good use of it?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She has experienced the life of the wealthy and is now gradually beginning to live a good life. Naturally, she hopes that her life will continue to improve and that she will never again be looked down upon like she was in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She also wants to become wealthy, or at least appear respectable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as you're careful, the Reed family won't find out! After all, they have a huge conglomerate and Mr. Reed has to deal with so many things every day. People like us, how could Mr. Reed possibly pay attention to us all the time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona thought to herself, "What's wrong with just wanting to live a better life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda and Brian's hospital photos during a pregnancy check-up were taken and posted online, causing a lot of discussion. Brian publicly announced online that Valda is pregnant, and both of them, along with their families, are eagerly awaiting the arrival of this little life with great joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, Brian's official online account was almost hacked. The comments below were filled with well-known celebrities from the film and television industry sending their blessings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some even jokingly say that it's more complete than the appearances of all the stars on the red carpets in the industry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many fans take pride in finding their idols in the comment section.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a moment, Brian's comment section became the liveliest place online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, the Hart family's villa here has been unusually lively these days, with people coming to visit Valda from time to time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to the online announcement of her pregnancy, Valda has been staying at the villa these days, focusing on taking care of her pregnancy and working at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, her work can also be done at home, so it doesn't really affect her work progress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The studio assistant and some people from the magazine company also came to visit her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace, Lina, Amber, and Kyla formed a team to visit her directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina looked at Valda's still-flat belly and said, "Wow, you're so efficient! You were just saying you couldn't get pregnant, and now you're already expecting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda awkwardly smiled, "I didn't expect it to happen so quickly either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, how many babies are there?" asked Lina curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda almost choked on her saliva, "Uh, just one baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Lina couldn't help but exclaim, "It seems that among us, only Grace is lucky enough to have three babies in one pregnancy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla looked at Lina and couldn't help but laugh. "Do you think having multiple births is that easy to conceive?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Me too," shrugged Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace asked Valda, "How are you feeling now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Other than a bit more morning sickness, everything else is fine," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How long have you been pregnant? Morning sickness usually decreases gradually after three months," asked Amber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's been ten weeks," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sometimes, I feel like pregnancy is quite difficult to endure, but at other times, it's just a blink of an eye," said Amber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Kyla heard this, she seemed to have thought of something and turned to look at Amber. Then she gently patted her shoulder and said, "It's all in the past now, and your relationship with Simon is also very good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Uh, it's all in the past now," said Amber.</p></div>
