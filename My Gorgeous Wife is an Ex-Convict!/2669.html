        <h1>Chapter 2667</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what he said next made her freeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he said was... "I probably won't have kids of my own, so I&rsquo;ll probably never understand no matter how you explain it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked blankly at the person right in front of her. He looked down when he said this, and his long eyelashes concealed everything in his eyes. A blanket of solitude seemed to surround him, isolating him from his surroundings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he would not let anyone get near him, nor could she get near him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A week later, Valda Theller moved back to her place. She joined the film crew according to their original plan and began assisting the scriptwriter with the script.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could feel many people's strange glances on her first day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, even though the buzz of her news might have faded and it was quickly replaced by other eye-catching gossip news, everyone in the film crew knew about her past now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what they knew was the distorted facts online, not the real truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's her. She bullied others when she was in university. It's satisfying to know that she was bullied back in the end!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Reading her comics, I thought she was amiable. I didn't expect her to be so mean!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The producer probably regrets choosing her comic. There are other comics better than hers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those surrounding people seemed to be whispering, but their volume was not low, and Valda Theller could easily hear them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't mind the gossip. Just think of them as bullsh*t!" Camille Strickland said as she reassured her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry. I'm not a pampered princess who has never experienced anything in her life. It's just some gossip. I can stand them." Valda Theller smiled at her best friend to reassure her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller discussed the plot with the scriptwriter the entire morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After discussing for a while, the director called the scriptwriter away, so Valda Theller stayed alone in the room and waited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the room door was pushed open, and a figure rushed in while panting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked up and frowned when she saw the intruder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Raymond Bowman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Knowing Raymond Bowman had invested in the film, she knew she might not be able to avoid meeting him. However, if possible, she did not want to meet him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're looking for the scriptwriter, they're with the director," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman approached her and said, "I'm here to see you. How have you been these days?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine," Valda Theller said with a blank expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry about the viral post. I had no idea that someone would expose the incident. I'll find out who's behind this and give you an explanation," said Raymond Bowman.</p></div>
