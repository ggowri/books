        <h1>Chapter 4138</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Tina!" Chandler's voice sounded from behind Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina turned her head and saw Chandler walking towards them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler approached Tina's side. "You were out for quite a long time, so I came to check on you." He casually held Tina's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit caught a glimpse of their intertwined hands from the corner of his eye. Chandler's action seemed like a deliberate declaration of sovereignty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But even if Chandler didn't do this, Kit wouldn't have any intentions towards Miss Stephenson from the Stephenson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, if the alliance between the two families was truly ruined, the consequences wouldn't be something a small person like him could bear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler's gaze fell on Kit's face. "Mr. Ingram, you don't look well. Is there something wrong with your health?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, I'm fine. Thank you for your concern, Mr. Hunter. I'll head back to the private room now," Kit replied, lifting his feet and walking towards the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina frowned. Was Kit really okay like that? He looked so pale, as if he could collapse at any moment!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, she felt a sharp pain in her hand. Tina couldn't help but exclaim, "Ouch!" It turned out Chandler was holding her hand too tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sorry!" Chandler quickly let go of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On Tina's fair fingers, there were some red marks that looked particularly prominent!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's nothing," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Chandler still carefully cradled her hand in his palm and gently rubbed the spot where he had accidentally hurt her earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You seem to care a lot about Kit," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Because yesterday..." Tina's voice suddenly faltered, and she didn't continue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yesterday?" Chandler narrowed his eyes. "What happened yesterday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina bit her lip, seemingly contemplating how to explain. "Well, yesterday, when Eugenia and I went to see Kit's concert, Kit and I got trapped in an elevator together. We were stuck for quite a while, and Kit... um, was a little scared. I'm afraid that the trauma of being trapped in the elevator yesterday might still affect him today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She deliberately concealed the fact that Kit had claustrophobia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You were trapped in an elevator with him?" Chandler froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yeah, we were stuck for over half an hour! The elevator suddenly lost power! It's a good thing I wasn't the only one trapped in there yesterday, otherwise, I would probably have been scared too," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although it seemed like she helped Kit while they were in the elevator yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But on the other hand, Kit's presence was also reducing her fear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What about you? Are you injured? Why didn't you tell me!" Chandler anxiously exclaimed, carefully examining Tina's gaze as if trying to find any signs of injury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm fine, I didn't get hurt!" Tina reassured, raising her hand again when Chandler still seemed concerned. "I really didn't get hurt! If I were injured, I would have gone to the hospital a long time ago. How could I still be here having a meal with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler breathed a sigh of relief. "Then why didn't you tell me that you were trapped in the elevator yesterday? If you hadn't accidentally let it slip just now, were you planning to never let me know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But it's not a big deal," Tina said casually. She wasn't injured, and they were only trapped for a little over half an hour. She didn't think it was necessary to specifically tell him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But to me, it is a big deal," Chandler embraced Tina. "Tina, to me, everything about you is a big deal!"</p></div>
