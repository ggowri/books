        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know, I won't mind," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then...," Jasper hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Do you not want to have an abortion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is my child. We struggled together on the brink of life and death, and I don't want to, and can't give up this child," Nancy replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But your body may not be able to safely give birth to this child now. If something happens to you again, my brother..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if I have an abortion, it will also harm my body," Nancy said. Miss Fowler had also told her about the doctor's judgment on whether she should have an abortion when she was at the clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Whether I have an abortion or not, it will harm my body. So why wouldn't I choose to keep this child?" Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if you continue to be pregnant, it will cause even greater harm to your body. Because of your pregnancy, many medications cannot be used, and some of your injuries have not been treated well. They may become chronic diseases in the future and may never be cured!" Jasper said anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But this child is my only relative now," Nancy said. "The only blood relative I have in this world. I don't want to give up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, have you ever experienced the feeling of being completely alone in this world?" Nancy interrupted abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course you haven't. You have parents who love you, siblings, William, and many friends. But it's different for me. My father passed away when I was young, and later my mother remarried into the Schultz family. But I felt very oppressed living with them, so I moved out as soon as I could be independent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But then my mother passed away, and I...I was separated from your older brother. At that time, the feeling of loneliness was too strong for me. It was like even if I died one day, no one in this world would remember me or shed a tear for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked down at her swollen belly. "Now, I finally have someone with me. This child has been with me through life and death, so I want to protect it and not give up. If even I give up on it, then it will be as if it never existed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Jasper listened to Nancy's words, she felt all the persuasive words she had planned to say were stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had never experienced what Nancy had gone through, so how could she persuade her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Isn't it the same principle that one should not advise others on what they have not experienced themselves?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, Jasper, you don't need to persuade me anymore. My decision won't change," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For the next few days, Nancy didn't see Mick again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper and Grace, on the other hand, often visited her in the hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The medical environment and doctors in the county hospital were much better than those in the health clinic, as were the nursing staff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Miss Fowler also visited Nancy a few times, but because the village where Miss Fowler lived was not convenient to get to the county hospital, Nancy advised her not to tire herself out by coming to see her too often.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family has arranged doctors, nurses, and caregivers to take care of Miss Fowler in the hospital, so she can rest assured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other hand, the Reed family has also taken care of Miss Fowler. According to her, they even asked her if she would like to go to Emerald City in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned. Emerald City... She needs to go there for treatment in a few days.</p></div>
