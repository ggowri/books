        <h1>Chapter 910</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace received a phone call from Mrs. Corbyn. Mrs. Corbyn sounded distraught on the phone. "Grace, well... Yun and Nelson were taken away by Martin Weiss. What&hellip; What do we do now? She told me not to worry, but the&hellip; The more I think about it, the more worried I am. She's no longer answering her phone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. "What happened? Are you guys still in Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, we were about to check-in, but Yun took Nelson to the washroom. I waited for them, but they never came, so I called and Yun said she&rsquo;s with Martin Weiss..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was choking by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately comforted Mrs. Corbyn, saying, "Don't worry, Aunty. I'll figure something out and contact you later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned once she hung up the phone. She thought things would be better for Kyla after she moved to G City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss took Kyla and Nelson away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Where will he take them to? Are they out of the city? Or are they still in Emerald City?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What do I have to do to find Kyla and Nelson? Should I call the police?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, Kyla is with Nelson and they haven't gone missing for 24 hours. Besides, Kyla and Martin Weiss know each other. Kyla also told Mrs. Corbyn that she&rsquo;s with Martin Weiss and told her not to worry&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police might not handle the case at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'In that case, the fastest way to find someone in Emerald City&hellip;' Jason's face flashed through Grace's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Jason is willing to help, I could find out where Kyla and Nelson are right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... Jason&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip. 'Forget it. Kyla and Nelson matter most right now.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Martin Weiss was someone Kyla desperately wanted to get away from. Kyla had been careful to protect Nelson from Martin Weiss. This was about as bad as it got!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'God knows what kind of conflict they might have and whether Kyla will overreact.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace subconsciously tried to get Jason's phone number from her contacts, but the next moment, her hands stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I've deleted Jason's phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I've deleted both phone numbers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'His phone number is&hellip;' A series of digits appeared in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It turns out&hellip; I've memorized his phone number!' Grace gave a wry smile and dialed the number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the large conference room, a senior executive of Reed Group was giving a presentation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sat in the president's seat, leaning back on the chair while staring coldly at the senior executive who was presenting the series of data on the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The senior executive only felt a cold sweat covering his back. Although the president did not say anything, everyone knew that the president was not in a good mood these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, you could even call it bad!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several senior executives had suffered because of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The president did not swear, but the low air pressure from him was enough to make people tremble. One vice president was even fired yesterday!</p></div>
