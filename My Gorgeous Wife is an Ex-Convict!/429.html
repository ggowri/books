        <h1>Chapter 428</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she had always been with Martin Weiss since the beginning, she had never seen Jason because the Weiss family and the Reed family never had any business deals. Now, she had bumped into Jason twice in just two days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed as if he was constantly by Grace&rsquo;s side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn recalled Jason&rsquo;s warning to her, and she looked at Graces&rsquo; gaze while feeling puzzled. For people like Grace to be loved by someone like Jason, she contemplated whether it was a misfortune or a blessing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nonetheless, she still hoped that Grace would ultimately find happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Ah, by the way, I forgot to buy some fruits. I recall Nelson telling me that he wanted to eat pomegranates while he&rsquo;s in the hospital,&rdquo; Grace said as she searched her phone for places to buy pomegranates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, what Grace meant was that Nelson had expressed it to her in sign language.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No need for that, Grace. You&rsquo;ve already bought toys for Nelson. I&rsquo;ll get pomegranates for him later,&rdquo; Kyla Corbyn retorted quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;ll be quick. I saw a fruit stand at the entrance of the hospital and there should be some pomegranates there. I&rsquo;ll go down and come back up real quick,&rdquo; Grace continued, &ldquo;I have to do it since I promised Nelson.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she finished her sentence, Grace hurriedly left the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thus, Kyla Corbyn, Mrs. Corbyn, and Jason were left in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was aware of Jason&rsquo;s identity due to her daughter&rsquo;s explanation the day before. At that moment, she felt slightly uncomfortable being in the same ward as such a powerful man. Hence, she merely pretended to look at her grandson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Kyla Corbyn, she took the initiative to say, &ldquo;Young Master Reed, would you like some tea?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No need,&rdquo; Jason replied indifferently. His eyes fell on Nelson who was still asleep on the bed. &ldquo;This child, does he belong to you and Martin Weiss?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The simple sentence shocked Mrs. Corbyn and Kyla Corbyn. Additionally, Mrs. Corbyn flew into panic as she almost bounced off her chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Kyla Corbyn, she was much calmer than her mother. She looked at Jason and said, &ldquo;Is that what you learned from investigating my background?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, but the information I have is just an inference based on time. Moreover...&rdquo; The corner of Jason&rsquo;s lips curved upward. &ldquo;The most interesting part is that Martin Weiss doesn&rsquo;t seem to be aware that he has a son.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;...&rdquo; Kyla Corbyn pursed her lips and said with slight difficulty, &ldquo;Nelson is my son alone. From the beginning, Martin Weiss had never wished for Nelson&rsquo;s existence, so he has nothing to do with him. Young Master Reed, you said you wouldn&rsquo;t interfere with affairs concerning Martin Weiss and me. Therefore, I hope that you won&rsquo;t say anything about Nelson to anyone.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Please, Young Master Reed!&rdquo; Mrs. Corbyn exclaimed anxiously. She even got up and ran to Jason&rsquo;s side, making a gesture as if she would kneel and beg the other party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Mom,&rdquo; Kyla Corbyn hurriedly stopped her mother, fearing that her mother&rsquo;s temporary urgency to plead would make Jason unhappy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said before that I&rsquo;m not interested in matters concerning you and Martin Weiss. However, Grace seems to&hellip; like the kid,&rdquo; Jason said as he glanced at the little guy on the hospital bed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lucky that Grace likes him, so it can be regarded that he has helped himself out.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was a little confused when she heard the second half of Jason&rsquo;s sentence, but Kyla Corbyn understood what he meant in a heartbeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before this, she wondered why the hospital suddenly had a specialist to give Nelson a consultation. Not to mention, they were given a considerable discount in terms of medical fees. Rehabilitation training was also arranged by the hospital and all she needed to pay was a small amount of money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like was a gift from the heavens, but was it as simple as she and her son got lucky?</p></div>
