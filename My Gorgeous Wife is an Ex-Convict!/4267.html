        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying these words, he reluctantly let go of her hands and left behind the divorce agreement that he had signed, turning around and leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina stared blankly at the divorce agreement. As long as she had the lawyer take the agreement to the registry office, the divorce procedures could be taken care of on her behalf.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't be bound by this marriage anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why did her heart feel so heavy? Like that day, she couldn't help but want to cry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't even understand, why she wanted to cry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler didn't need her to reluctantly give birth to another child. Wasn't that a good thing for her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A child shouldn't be born just because of the reason to save a life, they shouldn't be burdened with some kind of fate from the moment they're born!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the tears couldn't be controlled and fell one by one until her face was soaked with tears...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler returned to the company, and his subordinates approached him to report on work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what surprised his subordinates was that after the report, Mr. Hunter didn't give any instructions as usual. He seemed absent-minded and his face was extremely pale.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hunter?" the subordinate said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler seemed as if he hadn't heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hunter?" the subordinate raised his voice slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, a mouthful of blood suddenly sprayed out from Chandler's mouth, and his tall body fell straight to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hunter!" The subordinate was frightened and quickly supported Chandler!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when Chandler was taken to the hospital, members of the Hunter family rushed to the hospital upon hearing the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her son lying in the hospital bed, his face pale, Adele couldn't help but shed tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on with you? The doctor said your physical condition is very poor and you're burdened by something in your heart, which caused you to cough up blood. What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine," Chandler said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it because of the curse in your body?" Adele continued, "I've been saying that you should quickly have another child with Tina so that you can be saved. Otherwise, if this continues, your health will only deteriorate further! The next time the curse strikes, no matter what, you must go through it with Tina!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Chandler said, "I won't be with Tina </span><span>any more</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele was stunned, "What do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Mr. Hunter and Colin also looked at Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina and I have already divorced!" When Chandler said this, the three members of the Hunter family were shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Divorced? You actually divorced Tina?" Adele couldn't believe it, "Are you trying to kill yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, I don't want to bind Tina with marriage!" Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nonsense!" the old Mr. Hunter said sternly, "Divorce is a matter of life and death for you. The two families had an agreement in the past, and this marriage cannot be ended just by the two of you saying so!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that, the old Mr. Hunter turned to his son and said, "Go to the Stephenson family and inform them that we will pretend we never heard about the divorce. Tina must be with Chandler!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Colin replied. After all, it concerned his son's life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No one is allowed to go to the Stephenson family, especially not to find Tina!" Chandler struggled to get out of the hospital bed, "This is between Tina and me, none of you should </span><span>interfere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what about your own life?" Adele cried.</span></p></div>
