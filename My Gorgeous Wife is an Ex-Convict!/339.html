        <h1>Chapter 338</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now the room was quiet with no one making a sound. Grace noticed that Old Master Reed was looking at her very carefully, but there was some disdain and disgust in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides a nurse, there was also the man who brought her here. He had claimed to be Old Master Reed's private secretary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know why I brought you here?" Finally, after a while, Old Master Reed's voice broke the silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Grace. "It's probably because of Jason." It would be a lie to say that she was not nervous on her way here. However, once she got here, she somehow calmed down after looking at Old Master Reed's disgusted eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been through the worst, so how bad could it get now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed snorted. "You would know!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you trying to say?" Grace asked outright. Perhaps because she was really tired after all she had gone through, but she did not want to beat around the bush anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I never thought he would let you live in Reed Residence. Do women like you think you can get into the Reed family like this?" Old Master Reed said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was now more or less clear that the old man wanted to frighten her today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hung her head low and made no noise. The old man probably would not believe anything she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed seemed a little bored with her silence. He turned to his secretary who was nearby and asked, "What do you think my grandson sees in this woman?".</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know, but there must be something special about her," replied the secretary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The old man waved his hand and as if he was tired. He said, "I see nothing special about her, but her face seems unlovable. Just ruin her face and see if Jason still wants her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right," answered the secretary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace trembled and jerked up her head, looking at Old Master Reed in dismay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ruin her face&mdash;the old man spoke so calmly as if it was a common thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bitterly laughed to herself. She almost forgot that Old Master Reed was once a powerful man. Since he had someone bring her here today, it was only natural that he would say more than a few words of warning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did she expect the old man to send her back home after giving her a warning?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The secretary took a dagger out of his chest and walked over to Grace. She looked at him. There was no panic on her face nor did she plead for mercy. She was just&hellip; quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed was a little surprised at her reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not escaping?" the man asked as he approached Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no escape," she answered calmly. After all, the man could serve at Old Master Reed's side and was appointed by the old man to do such a thing. He must be skilled while she was just like any other ordinary person. In other words, she had no skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, even if she could escape from this ward, could she escape from this hospital?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her reason told her to accept her fate, but she was unwilling to. Why was her fate always at the mercy of others? They were all human, but she could not even resist when they tried to hurt her!</p></div>
