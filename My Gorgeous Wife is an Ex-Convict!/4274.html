        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, Tina just stared blankly at Chandler not far away. Everything around her seemed to be overshadowed by him, leaving only Chandler in her eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if sensing her gaze, Chandler, who was originally chatting with someone, turned his head and looked in Tina's direction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gazes met in an instant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Tina felt her heart pounding vigorously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a while, Chandler averted his gaze, as if it had merely swept past a stranger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the words he said to her in the hospital flashed through Tina's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So now, does he see her as a stranger?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Apart from matters concerning their daughter, do they have no relationship anymore?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina always felt like there was a void in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina continued to watch Chandler, standing motionless in place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps she had been staring for too long, as people around her started looking in her direction!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gazes of those around her assessed the situation between her and Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people knew that she and Chandler had divorced, so the looks from the crowd toward the two of them were somewhat strange!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina and Hadwin were originally chatting with Brian, but when they unintentionally witnessed this scene, Lina instinctively wanted to go forward but was stopped by Hadwin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the children's matter. Don't go, Tina has to face it alone!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Lina looked at her daughter standing there dumbfounded under the gaze of the crowd, looking at Chandler, but Chandler seemed to not have seen her at all and didn't look at his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This situation made Lina, as a mother, feel very sad.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is Tina's own choice, no matter what, she has to face it. Even if you can help her this time, can you help her forever?" Hadwin said. "Besides, if she really has no feelings for Chandler, then she wouldn't feel upset."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if she feels upset?" Lina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The way our daughter is now, she doesn't seem indifferent no matter how you look at it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadwin said, "If that's the case, it means she does have feelings for Chandler, she just doesn't realize it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, it's something she has to deal with on her own," Hadwin said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it comes to our daughter's feelings, he doesn't want to interfere. But after our daughter makes a decision, he will be her support and protect her from all storms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, at this moment, Harley walked up to Tina and said, "Tina, are you looking at Chandler?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's approach helped Tina snap out of it and finally resolved the awkward situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The people around shifted their gazes away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at Harley and nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you really divorce Chandler?" Harley asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she asked this question, her eyes were clear, purely asking this question, not like many others who ask such things just to know gossip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, we divorced," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you clearly still like Chandler, </span><span>Why</span><span> did you get divorced?" Harley asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was taken aback, "You misunderstood, I don't remember anything from before. I divorced him because I didn't have feelings for him anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the way you looked at Chandler just now, it was clearly the look of someone who likes </span><span>him," Harley said.</span></p></div>
