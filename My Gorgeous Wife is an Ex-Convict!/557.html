        <h1>Chapter 556</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her face close to his, she took the initiative to place a kiss on his lips. "In my eyes, you look the best. A celebrity is just a celebrity, and you're the one I love. I&rsquo;d go through fire and water for you, but I wouldn't do it for a celebrity. Therefore, you don't need to get jealous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he was not secure enough, then she could give him security, no matter how much he needed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Go through fire and water... He looked startled as if he had not thought the phrase would come out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart seemed to be surrounded by a warm current. Then, with the beating of his heart, the warm current slowly spread throughout his limbs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was his Grace, the Grace he loved most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'd go through fire and water for you, no matter what!" The words came softly out of his mouth but weighed a thousand pounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a promise, a lifelong promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This woman had imperceptibly imprinted into his life, she was... Even more important than his life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Lina happily looked at the photos sent by her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hmm&hellip; What a handsome man! No wonder Howell Webb was the man with both looks and acting skills in the entertainment industry. Even his stupid look in the new movie could make people see his handsome appearance, and that was really rare!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In particular, those posters her best friend sent her were limited edition and rare. It was said that they were Howell Webb's special gifts for his fans. One needed to win a lucky draw to get them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, Grace owned all of these limited edition posters. Lina felt her teeth becoming sore with envy. Hmm... Maybe she could talk Grace into giving her one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She preferred the one with the upper part of his body exposed. His lean muscles were so drool-worthy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you so fascinated by?" A voice rang, and then, out of nowhere, Lina's phone was taken across the table by a hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Lina gave out a low cry and looked at Hadwin who was sitting across the table. How dare the man... Snatch her phone. "Nothing. Give it back to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin's face immediately darkened as he looked at the photo on her phone screen. This was... Howell Webb! Speaking of which, he could easily recognize Howell Webb's face because of Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was dating him, but some time ago, every day when it was time, she would watch the TV series Howell Webb starred in. Even when they were on a date, she would hold her phone and watch the TV series, which made him, a person unfamiliar to all the male celebrities, now aware of who Howell Webb was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The photo she was looking at on her phone showed Howell Webb with his exposed upper body muscles. He was posing in a fashionable pose. With his looks, it was easy to cause some young girls to scream in excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, this included the 28-year-old woman in front of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin stared at Lina's phone moodily, considering whether to do something and blacklist Howell Webb or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Lina was extremely fickle. She fangirled over a lot of celebrities. Even if he deleted the celebrities' photos on her phone today, there would be new ones tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he wanted to blacklist the celebrities she fangirled over, half of the entertainment industry's A-list and B-list celebrities would probably be blacklisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was full of helplessness as he thought of this.</p></div>
