        <h1>Chapter 3527</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was taken aback and before he could react, Jasper had already taken his hand and hooked her pinky finger with his, saying, "Let's pinky swear, no backsies. If you break it, you're a little dog!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't help but laugh at her childish words and replied, "Okay, if I break it, I'm a little dog."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was finally satisfied and a content expression appeared on her face. However, her peripheral vision unintentionally glanced past him and towards his back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then, her expression suddenly changed and she lifted her foot, rushing past him towards his back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The situation happened suddenly, in the blink of an eye, Jasper had already run in the opposite direction, and William instinctively chased after her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a few steps, he caught up to Jasper and grabbed her, asking "What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let go of me!" Jasper urgently shouted, struggling to break free from William's grip and continuing to run forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William felt his hand empty, but at this moment, he couldn't think about anything else and instinctively ran after Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper ran for a while before stopping, gasping for breath. He looked around urgently, as if searching for something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you looking for?" William ran up to Jasper and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think I saw Lawrence just now," Jasper murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when the word "Lawrence" came out of Jasper's mouth, William was suddenly startled. A strong sense of unease spread through his body. "You saw Lawrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, he was just behind you a moment ago," Jasper said, pursing his lips and recalling the scene he had just witnessed. "That person...should be Lawrence, although he's grown taller. But I don't think I could be mistaken."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's been several years, so his appearance should have changed a lot. Maybe you mistook someone else for me just now," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper bit her lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did she make a mistake? Yes, the Lawrence she remembered was the Lawrence from when she was 10 years old. It had been several years since then, so Lawrence's appearance might have changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the person just now looked like the grown-up Lawrence she had imagined, who knows what Lawrence has grown into over the years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe I really did make a mistake," Jasper said with a dim look in her eyes. "If Lawrence really appeared, he should have come to me and fiercely questioned why I didn't answer that call and why I didn't save his parents."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her remorseful expression and gently stroked her head, "It's okay, don't blame yourself. This isn't your fault."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper gave a bitter smile, "Everyone says it's not my fault, but... is it really not my fault? If I had answered that phone call back then, maybe some things could have been different."</p></div>
