        <h1>Chapter 1125</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You were the first to be kind to me, so I'm willing to help you," said Grace. She might not be able to help Kyla much, though.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It had been nearly five years since Kyla's case. Even if there was evidence, it would be particularly difficult to investigate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, Grace also thought of Jason, who helped her overturn her case. If it had not been for Jason, the charge for drunk driving and causing death would still be on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop thinking about it! It's really over between us!' Grace told herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Near the window, Nelson was standing on a chair. His upper body was bent over the ledge as he looked through the window at Kyla Corbyn, who had climbed onto her motorcycle cart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson, are you looking at Mommy?" asked Mrs. Corbyn, who was standing next to the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," answered the little one. He kept looking at Kyla Corbyn until her figure got smaller and smaller and he could no longer see her. Then, he gently lowered his eyes and quietly clenched his small hands into fists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;ll protect Mommy. Even if Mommy has been to prison and even if Mommy's a bad guy, I'll protect Mommy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Because she&rsquo;s my favorite Mommy!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the afternoon, Lawyer Carter handed Grace a small USB flash drive. "This is something your cousin Stella left here this morning. She just called, saying she needs it urgently and asked you to deliver it to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Me?" Grace was a little stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter said, "Yes. Why don't you go over since you have nothing to do now? I'll give you the address."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the USB flash drive. It was black and small. It looked pretty inconspicuous, but&hellip; "Did she use a USB flash drive when she came here this morning?" she asked Lawyer Carter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't think so. She just came over this morning to look at the papers we prepared for the lawsuit," said Lawyer Carter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the USB flash drive and left the office after Lawyer Carter gave her the address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did Stella leave the USB flash drive at the office by accident? But she didn&rsquo;t use a USB flash drive when she was at the office.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace arrived at the address Lawyer Carter gave her and saw that they were filming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a shopping mall, but it was relatively deserted. It usually did not have many customers. The film crew chose the first floor for the filming, and many people were gathered around the filming site.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought of the gossip news she had seen. Stella seemed to be acting in a popular TV drama right now. Although she was only playing a supporting role, the role was of a more flattering type. Besides, the male and female leading roles were played by A-list actors who were popular and had commendable acting skills. They were a guarantee for the show&rsquo;s strong ratings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Stella had gotten a supporting role in the drama, everyone online said that if the crown prince of the entertainment industry wanted to make someone famous, even an outsider could easily become the best actress!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They even listed all the entertainment industry resources Brian's former girlfriends had obtained because of Brian to show the crown prince's ability in making people famous!</p></div>
