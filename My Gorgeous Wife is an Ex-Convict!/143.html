        <h1>Chapter 142</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Jason really did help Grace take revenge on the Stevens family, then the Stevens family would lose so much to the point where they would no longer be one of the rich and powerful families in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed, I..." Sean wanted to defend himself.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Grace interrupted him and said to Jason, "There's no need. He had already become a stranger to me when we broke up back then. I should be thankful. I got to see a relationship clearly because of a car accident."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean's face turned pale, and he felt defeated. When Grace said these words, she didn't even look at him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"In that case, good." Jason stood up and walked up to Sean. He patted him on the shoulder and said, "You should thank her for not wanting to take revenge on you. Otherwise, by this time next year, we wouldn't see the Stevens family's businesses in this city."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean was terrified and he was sweating all over. He could only quickly thank Grace before he helped Zoe out of the room.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was not until the two siblings left the hospital that they felt relieved.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Brother, why do you think Jason has taken an interest in Grace?" Zoe said angrily.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I've already told you not to mess with Grace," he replied in a bad mood.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace is simply relying on Jason for his power and authority! Without him, what is she even worth!" Zoe had just suffered so much and had been humiliated, now she hated Grace passionately.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you know that if she had said that she wanted revenge, the Stevens family would be in some serious trouble!" At least for that, Sean was still grateful to Grace. At the very least, she did not add insult to injury.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Would Jason really deal with the Stevens family for a street sweeper?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What do you think?" Sean rolled his eyes at his sister. "Anyway, for the sake of the Stevens family, don't provoke Grace again. Or, don't come to us for help in the future because you will drag down our entire family with you if you do!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe still wanted to retort, but when she thought of the scene in the hospital room, she shivered and stayed silent.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, in the hospital room, Jason was still standing in front of Grace. He bent down and looked at her. There was a slight smile on his handsome face and his extremely beautiful amorous eyes were shining as bright and beautiful as the moonlight.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This sort of man seemed like an angel on the surface, but when he did something, it made people shudder in fear.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you happy today, sis?" Even his voice was so gentle and pleasing to the ear.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace steadied her gaze at the man in front of her and said, "You deliberately asked Sean and his sister to come here today to cause this scene. You wanted to show me that something I could never achieve in my entire life can be easily done by you, right?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Not only that." He said, "I still want to tell you, sis, that I can give you everything from dignity to respect. I can even give you back your previous life. I can give you everything you hope for."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He gently lifted a strand of her hair that had fallen on her shoulder.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"In the future, if you want to be a lawyer, or a star, or a boss, I can help you. I can help you live over everyone else so that those who looked down on you and laughed at you in the past will bow their heads in front of you. Tell me, is that okay?" He whispered to her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His gentle voice was like the most beautiful voice in the world.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was presenting such a tempting gift in front of her. With his ability, he could really give it to her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But &mdash; "Do you want me to stay with you?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's right," he said.</p></div>
