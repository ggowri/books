        <h1>Chapter 1093</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was curious and took a few more pills once. As a result, I slept for three days and got my stomach pumped in the hospital. It was only then that they found out that the servant had changed the pills," he said, looking up at her with intense self-mockery in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know what? That servant was the nicest person to me when I first got to the Reed family. She showed great concern for me. Every day, she would smile gently as she watched me take the &lsquo;vitamin&rsquo; pills she had switched out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anger welled up in Grace's heart. "How could someone do this to a child just to make life easier and go on a date? Didn&rsquo;t she think about the consequences of a child taking too many sleeping pills?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In severe cases, it could even lead to mental distress in kids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled lightly. "There are many people like that in the world. They can easily sacrifice others for small profits."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened afterward? What happened to the servant?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Reed family fired her," he said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace figured that if she was fired, the servant would probably have suffered for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you start hating taking medicine since then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," he responded lightly. Taking medicine would remind him of the pain of having his stomach pumped and the awful experience of him lying on the hospital bed weakly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when Old Master Reed came to his ward to visit him, there was not even a hint of affection in his eyes. He only told him about his vitamin pills being switched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You were lucky this time. You&rsquo;ll only lose your life if you ever trust others so easily again. I won't help you even if you're my grandson. You have no right to stay in the Reed family if you have no sense of preparedness!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was then that he found out how cruel his grandfather was to him. Old Master Reed&hellip; probably knew about his vitamins being switched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although outsiders saw him as the young master and future heir to the Reed family, only he knew how much he was treading on thin ice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't like to take medicine, and if I do take it, I&rsquo;ll take extra care and get them myself," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "Well... Why don&rsquo;t you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to take back the medicine she had given him so he could open the disposable package and take them out himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she finished speaking, he swallowed the medicine she had given him with water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Grace looked at Jason in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark eyes turned to her almond-shaped eyes that were full of surprise. "I'll eat anything you give me." Even if she gave him poison, he would take it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason fell asleep after taking the medicine. Grace looked at him as he slept and was caught in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not the first time he had taken the medicine she gave him, but she had not felt differently until she knew why he hated taking medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now that she knew the traumatic experience he had with taking medicine yet he would still take the medicine she gave him, she felt something else.</p></div>
