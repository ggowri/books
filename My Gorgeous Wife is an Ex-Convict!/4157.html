        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah," she replied. Those words were simply too offensive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't be hurt," Chandler shrugged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Such verbal attacks didn't affect him at all. If it weren't for that journalist who didn't know his place, dragging Tina into it, he wouldn't have bothered saying anything to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Didn't you feel hurt at all?" Tina carefully observed Chandler, as if afraid that the journalist's words just now would upset him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "When you look at me like that, it makes me feel fragile, like I can't handle any kind of blow." He chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina awkwardly touched her nose, "I'm just afraid that you'll take those nonsense words to heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No, there are very few things in this world that can stay in my heart." Chandler gazed at the person in front of him firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Suddenly, Tina felt her face getting warm. The way he looked at her and said those words, it was as if he was silently saying that only she, he would keep in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because it was getting late, the two of them had a simple dinner outside before returning to Chandler's place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Alright, now you can tell me why you came to the company to find me today." Chandler spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina almost forgot about it herself, she didn't expect Chandler to remember.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It's because of Kit's situation, I was feeling a bit down, so I wanted to talk to you." Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What happened to him again?" Chandler's eyes flashed with a hint of curiosity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It seemed that unnoticed, the number of times she mentioned Kit was increasing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He could only keep telling himself to try to understand the kind of feelings fans have for their idols, but he had never liked any idol before, so truly experiencing this kind of feeling wasn't easy for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So Tina told Chandler about the resources she obtained from her parents and the conversation she had with Kit on campus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I didn't expect him to think like that, or maybe he thinks it's normal to exchange his body for resources? Or... maybe I misunderstood him." Tina said dejectedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Don't you really like him? So when he made that proposal, what did you think?" Chandler hinted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina blinked her eyes, "The proposal itself is ridiculous, I just find it unbelievable. At least in my opinion, he shouldn't be that kind of person!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But if you like someone, don't you also want to have their body?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was taken aback, but she didn't get angry because of Chandler's words. Instead, she seriously said, "The way I like him is that I want him to shine even more on his own stage, to be more dazzling, and to have more people like him. But this kind of liking is different from my liking for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As Tina spoke, she raised her hand and gently touched Chandler's cheek, "My liking for you is possessive. I don't want many people to like you, I don't want you to attract too much attention. I want to be with you all the time, I want you to belong only to me, no one can take you away, and no one else can have you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Those were two completely different kinds of liking, but she didn't know if he would truly understand what she meant by saying this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's cheek rubbed against the palm of Tina's hand, his beautiful and deep eyes gazing at her, "If that's what you want, then I will belong only to you, no one can take me away. So, you also have to do as you said, not give yourself to anyone else."</p></div>
