        <h1>Chapter 1875</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She replied in a mutter, "Yeah, I can't bear to do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The vegetable beef soup was soon ready. They sat down at the dining table. Jason took the chopsticks and spoons. They began to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, do you believe me?" Grace asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"As long as you don't do anything to betray me, then I&rsquo;ll always trust you," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's hands tightened as she held the chopsticks. "What if I... have to betray you one day? If many reasons cause me to inadvertently betray you, will you..." She pressed her lips together and said with difficulty, "Will you forgive me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What if I don't forgive you?" he seemed to ask casually as he continued to drink the vegetable beef soup she made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her fingers instantly loosened, and the chopsticks in her hand clattered onto the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He glanced at the chopsticks and then her face. "What's the matter? Are you shocked to hear me say that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Shocked... Yeah, I'm shocked.' Grace acquiesced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said, "Anyone in this world can betray me. Terrence, Uncle Kwan, even Mick, and the other children. But not you, Grace. You're the only one who can't betray me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was instantly stunned, never expecting to hear him say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm the only one... who can't?" she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Because you're the one I love and care about the most, so you can't betray me. I don't know what I would do if you ever betray me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace felt heavy-hearted when Jason finished talking. It was as if she was being pressed by a boulder, making her almost out of breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could only look down in a fluster and say, "Hurry... Hurry and eat before it gets cold!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes gleamed, and he lowered his head to drink the bowl of vegetable beef soup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As the night deepened, Grace looked at Jason, who was sleeping by her side. Her eyes were full of guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew that what she was about to do would hurt him, but she did not want blood on his hands&mdash;even though there might not be blood at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The moonlight shone on him through the window, and his sleeping face looked so peaceful that her eyes caught sight of the scar underneath his night robe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She gently pulled open the collar of his robe and quietly peered at the scar. His mother had given it to him in the past. Was she giving him another one now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She bent over and kissed his scar with her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, I'm sorry," she murmured and got up to leave, not noticing the fingers beside her quivering slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace walked out of Reed Residence unimpeded. The security guards on night watch would not bother the mistress even though they saw her.</p></div>
