        <h1>Chapter 4167 Cupid</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> That's because in her family, it's her mom who has the final say!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Don't be fooled by the high position and power her dad has outside, when he comes home, he still obediently listens to her mom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even when her mom said she wanted to enjoy the pleasure of having her eyebrows done, she made her dad do it. And when her mom didn't like his skills, she directly found a master-level makeup artist to teach him how to do eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "If your parents agree, then the wedding should happen soon. If you have any concerns, we can also keep it low-key for now and wait for the future..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's words were interrupted by Tina, "What's with being low-key? When we get married, we should definitely be high-profile. I want everyone to know that you're already mine, so no one dares to have any ideas about you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She said something that made Chandler feel both amused and puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "By the way, let's go somewhere," Tina said, pulling Chandler into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When they arrived at their destination, Chandler looked up at the sign above the main entrance in astonishment. He never expected Tina to bring him to the Temple of Cupid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, this place didn't seem like somewhere she would visit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why did we suddenly come here?" Chandler asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I've wanted to come here with you for a long time. They say that by praying at the Temple of Cupid, a couple's relationship will be blessed," Tina said. Although she had thought about it before, she also realized that her relationship with Chandler was already good, so whether they prayed or not didn't really matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, now that they were about to get married, she felt a sudden urge. If their already good relationship could be even better, why not?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Do you believe in this?" Chandler asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, he was an atheist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Um, I believe in the good things and don't believe in the bad things," Tina grinned, then pulled Chandler into the temple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The temple was small, but there were quite a few people inside, as if it had become a popular spot for taking photos. Influencers could be seen posing at various locations in the temple that were known to produce good results.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina led Chandler to the statue of Cupid inside the temple. With a devout expression, she knelt down, clasped her hands together, closed her eyes, and silently made a wish. She then opened her eyes and stood up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "They say that the more sincere your prayers to Cupid, the more likely they are to come true," Tina explained to Chandler, as if justifying her previous actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Is that so?" Chandler murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, that's why the bond between us is so strong. Nothing can break it," Tina smiled and said, "Let's go outside the temple and take a look..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Before she could finish her sentence, Chandler suddenly took a step forward, lowered his body, and knelt in front of the statue of Cupid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina looked at Chandler in astonishment. Wait...didn't he not believe in gods and spirits? Why was he praying too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler also clasped his hands together, closed his eyes, and silently made a wish in front of the statue of Cupid. But after making the wish, he solemnly kowtowed three times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This action completely shocked Tina. Even the other people in the Temple of Cupid turned to look at Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, such a handsome man, bowing before Cupid like this, it looked like a painting no matter how you looked at it!</p></div>
