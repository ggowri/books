        <h1>Chapter 1040</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After some time, she heard Dr. Russell's voice. "We're done!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sharp tingling on the back of her hand subsided, and Grace breathed a long sigh of relief before opening her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's forearm immediately caught her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace finally realized she had been grasping his forearm and immediately let go. "I'm sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's fine. I asked you to grab it in the first place," said Brian as he withdrew his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell said to Grace, "Alright, come again this time next week. Be careful and don't touch water for three hours after you get back. Don't lift anything heavy with your hands either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they left Dr. Russell's small clinic, Brian said, "I'll drive you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&hellip; can take the bus myself," she said, turning to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stopped her and said, "Sending you home doesn't mean you have to promise me anything. You don't need to avoid me like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just don't want to give you any more trouble." She pushed his hand away, making him groan with a frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was a little surprised. She had not pushed his arm away with much force! Just then, Grace suddenly stared at Brian's sleeve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;He&rsquo;s wearing a white shirt today, but now there&rsquo;s a faint tint of red on his forearm near his wrist. Is that&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly thought of something and pulled Brian's sleeve up, exposing the injury on his forearm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were obvious scratch marks on his forearm. He was bleeding faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this... because I grabbed on to you just now?' Grace remembered how hard she had grabbed him when the pain was intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... I'm sorry," she apologized again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing you should apologize for. I did it on my own accord. You don't have to feel bad about it," he said, calmly lowering his sleeve. "Besides, it's only a scratch. It's no big deal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the more he downplayed it, the more uncomfortable she felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm going to ask Dr. Russell if he has any adhesive bandages for you to stop the bleeding," she said quickly, turning and running back to the small clinic behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, Grace came running out with an adhesive bandage in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Standing in front of Brian, she said, "Put your arm out first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled faintly and held out his right arm as she had asked. It was only a minor injury, but seeing her so serious put him in a good mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if... she cared about him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her head and carefully rolled up Brian's sleeve. Then, she put the adhesive bandage on his arm. "Don't do that again. I can't control my strength when I'm in pain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "It was of my free will! It was only through that I could experience how much pain you were suffering. However, I only experienced a small part of it. The pain you suffered during the treatment must have been far greater than this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not bear that pain for her, so suffering the pain with her was probably a good idea.</p></div>
