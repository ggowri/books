        <h1>Chapter 3813</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I don't know what you mean. I did make a call because she kept pestering me to drop the charges. I just told her not to bother me anymore, but I never met her," Daniel argued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Then why were her fingerprints found in your residence, and why did someone see her enter your house yesterday?" Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's face immediately changed. Fingerprints? He had already cleaned everything in the house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And which neighbor saw Veronica?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought everything was foolproof, but facing Mason's questioning at the moment, he felt extremely guilty, as if everything had been exposed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I haven't seen Veronica. I don't know why you say there are her fingerprints in my house," Daniel could only deny repeatedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, Mason doesn't have any evidence now. As long as he finds a chance to escape later, he will be safe!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think you can escape?" Mason seemed to have guessed his thoughts and asked directly, "The text message you sent me from Veronica's phone last night, was it you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel was suddenly stunned, staring at Mason in disbelief, "You--"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The high school campus will be demolished tomorrow, and there are many memories there. Can you accompany me to see the last campus? After all, we have too many emotions there," Mason suddenly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's expression became even more subtle. He knew that this was a sentence he had sent to Mason in the text message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If this message was really sent by her, she would never say 'too many emotions there'," Mason said, because Veronica knew that after hypnosis, those so-called emotions were no longer there, only memories remained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Daniel didn't know this. He sent this text message with the aim of appealing to Mason's emotions and making him come here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, I'll ask you one last time, where is Veronica?!" Mason asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know!" Daniel insisted that he didn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you want me to come here so much, then...she should be here, right?" Mason said, looking towards the old school building that was about to be demolished, and then said to the leader of the police on this side, "Captain Kenyon, please search the old school building to see if anyone is still inside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Captain Kenyon responded and prepared to arrange for people to enter the old school building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this situation, Daniel immediately panicked. After all, he had tied Veronica up in the old school building. If they went in to search, they would immediately find Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Veronica was found, all his crimes would be exposed. Everything he had done would be meaningless, and he might even be charged with attempted murder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why? Why did his carefully planned scheme turn out like this? Which step went wrong?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Captain Kenyon was going to lead the team inside to search, the planned explosion naturally stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at this moment, Mason's phone rang, indicating a new text message.</span></p></div>
