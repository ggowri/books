        <h1>Chapter 3465</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two got off the car and Mason held Veronica's hand as they walked into the amusement park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared blankly at the hand being held, reminiscing about how she used to be the one leading him forward by holding his hand. But at some point, it seemed like the roles had reversed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is Veronica feeling very sad?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica gave a bitter smile and said, "I guess I never thought we would break up like this." After all, Daniel was her first love, the kind of love she had always imagined to be beautiful. She even thought that her first love would be her last love, a love that would last a lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does Veronica not want to break up?" asked Mason. "If you still can't bear to part with Daniel, Veronica, then I can make sure that Daniel doesn't break up with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared at him for a moment, looking a bit dazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, do you want to?" he asked with his usual cold voice, but now it sounded somewhat elusive. His black eyes were too deep and heavy, making her unsure of what he was thinking at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I don't want to," she replied. "Since his feelings have changed, he's no longer the Daniel I love!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes flickered slightly, then he smiled and said, "Okay, let's break up, completely and thoroughly. You don't have to have any contact with him in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason pulled Veronica along to play in the amusement park, just like she used to pull him when they were kids!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt that her previously depressed and uncomfortable mood had gradually become more cheerful and her mood wasn't as bad anymore, with Mason's company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing a round of play, Mason bought an old-fashioned ice cream bar, unwrapped it, and handed it to Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica took a bite and it tasted just like the flavor from her childhood memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she soon realized that he didn't actually make the purchase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you not eat?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll just watch Veronica eat," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The taste is pretty good. These old-fashioned ice pops are not usually available in the mall. Why don't you buy one too?" she suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" he murmured softly, then leaned down and brought his lips close to the ice cream stick in her hand. He took a bite directly from one end and said, "This is how I'll taste it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica blinked her eyes and suddenly felt her heart racing with a quickening sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oh my goodness, what's wrong with her? Didn't they used to eat like this all the time when they were kids? She would take a few bites, then he would take a few bites. Now he just took a bite of her popsicle!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That taste is still the same, it's rare to come across it nowadays," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes...yes," Veronica stammered, her cheeks slightly blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After leaving the amusement park, Veronica looked at Mason and said, "Mason, thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you thanking me for?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you for being with me. It feels really good to have you by my side," she said. Without Mason in her life, things might have been a lot worse for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All along, she thought she was taking care of him, but in another sense, wasn't he also accompanying her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he was with her, she didn't feel lonely all these years. Even when she was sad and upset, there was someone to comfort her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does Veronica really feel this way?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mmm, really," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So Veronica will continue to feel this way in the future," he said. "No matter what happens!"</p></div>
