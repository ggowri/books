        <h1>Chapter 4341 She Wants to Break Off the Engagement</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The folks from the Quentin family were all quite sharp, so naturally, they could decipher the true meaning behind Brian's words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, both parties didn't say anything more, they just resumed their usual chat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once the banquet was over and the Hart family had left, Mrs. Quentin turned to her son and asked, "Lornell, what's going on with the Hart family? Don't tell me there's been some sort of hitch with your </span><span>engagement</span><span> </span><span>to Harley."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Lornell scoffed, "There won't be any mishaps. After all, </span><span>they are dealing with us, the </span><span>Quentins</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>T</span><span>hey can&rsquo;t just cancel it as they want</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that's true. After all, it was our Quentin family who saved Harley's life, so naturally, </span><span>they have to take the engagement seriously</span><span>." </span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, as she said this, Mrs. Quentin looked at her son with an inquisitive gaze, "But </span><span>what kind of feelings do you have for</span><span> Harley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Honestly, even as his mother, she had a hard time understanding Lornell's issues with </span><span>h</span><span>is</span><span> </span><span>relationships.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To say that he liked Harley didn't quite hit the mark. From her perspective, it had always been Harley who was more into Lornell</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if you were to say that Lornell didn't like Harley, well, they had been engaged for many years and everything had been peaceful. Lornell had never shown any intention of breaking off the engagement. In fact, Lornell seemed to care quite a bit about this engagement. She even once tested Lornell, asking if they should call off the engagement, but Lornell flatly refused</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of feelings should I have?" Lornell retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really like her or not?" Mrs. Quentin sighed, "Although I want to hold my grandchild sooner, I also hope </span><span>that you&rsquo;ll have a happy marriage</span><span>. After what the Hart family just said, I'm afraid even if Harley graduates, you two won't be getting married anytime soon."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not in a hurry. After all, getting married is just a matter of time," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> what do you think?" Mrs. Quentin was getting impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley is a good match for me," Lornell replied. "I think her personality is quite decent. She doesn't stir up trouble everywhere, nor does she put pressure on others. Being with her feels comfortable. Plus, with the background of the Hart family, she's well-suited to be my wife."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just suitable?" Mrs. Quentin was taken aback. Clearly, she hadn't expected this answer from her son.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, she's the perfect choice for me, isn't she?" said Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But just being compatible doesn't necessarily mean your marriage will last!" Mrs. Quentin expressed concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell suddenly snorted with laughter, "But Mom, didn't you marry Dad because he was a good match for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Lornell spoke, Mrs. Quentin's face changed instantly, with certain long-buried memories flashing through her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn&rsquo;t help wondering if Lornell heard what she said back then. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have said something like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, Mom, you don't need to worry about my marriage. I know what I'm doing," Lornell </span><span>said, before walking away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The worry in Mrs. Quentin's eyes, however, was even more intense.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kept wondering whether Lornell would regret it i</span><span>f </span><span>things continued like this</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell just hadn't met the person he loved yet. But one day, if he really did meet someone he could love, he</span><span> might</span><span> realize that being with the right person didn't necessarily guarantee happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the three members of the Hart family </span><span>ha</span><span>d</span><span> </span><span>returned home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Harley said seriously, "Mom, Dad, there's something I need to tell you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sudden seriousness on Harley's face took Brian and Valda by surprise. They exchanged a glance, and Brian said, "We're all ears, go ahead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to break off my engagement with Lornell!" Harley finally blurted out.</span></p></div>
