        <h1>Chapter 3503</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica obviously didn't expect Jasper to ask this, and her hand almost instinctively tightened the pendant on her neck. "I...my feelings for him are..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What are they? Just sibling feelings?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just treating Mason like family?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why is it that such a simple statement is now difficult to say?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you guys talking about?" A voice suddenly sounded, and the two looked up to see William asking, with Mason standing beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"N-nothing!" Veronica quickly replied, feeling a bit relieved that they appeared and saved her from answering that question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason looked at the pendant in Veronica's hand and his eyes flickered slightly. "Veronica, it's time to change your medicine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay!" Veronica stood up. "I'll go change my bandages now." With that, she hurried up the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her wounds needed to be changed once a day, and a nurse hired by the Reed family helped her with that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason followed her up the stairs, while Jasper and William remained in the lobby downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper watched the two of them leave, feeling sympathetic towards his own brother, Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Why do you have that look on your face?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was just thinking that Veronica probably doesn't like me, Mason, as much as she likes my brother, Mason," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why would you think that?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because I asked Veronica if she liked my brother, Mason, not as a sibling but as something more, and she hesitated and didn't answer. Then you guys came and she seemed relieved," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had actually been paying close attention to Veronica's expression earlier. "Do you think feelings can't change? Once you've decided someone is like a brother, is it impossible to see them as a boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, if it were you, would you be willing to change?" William asked, avoiding a direct answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Me?" Jasper blinked and didn't react for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, you. Would you be willing to change? Would you be willing to change the identity you have assigned to the other person to a different one? Or would you rather not change at all, and avoid any kind of change?" He asked, his black eyes staring at her intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I don't understand what you mean," Jasper said, confused. "Are you asking if I, as Veronica, would be willing to change my feelings? Let Mason be my boyfriend? But I'm not Veronica, so this hypothetical situation doesn't make any sense."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her innocent and confused expression made William's eyes dim slightly. "Yes, it doesn't make any sense," he said. What was he hoping for?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was he hoping that she would understand the meaning behind his words?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that she only saw him as an important friend for now, and she wasn't quite clear about her feelings yet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William, did I say something wrong?" Jasper suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you ask?" he replied.</p></div>
