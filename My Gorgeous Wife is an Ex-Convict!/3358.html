        <h1>Chapter 3356</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina continued, "At the time, it was just me, Jasmine, and Trista. I couldn't let Jasmine fight, but I couldn't let Harley get beaten up either. So, I took the lead with Trista and charged at them. Then, I told Jasmine to go find some backup!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Tina spoke, she became proud and started boasting about how her strategy was correct. When it comes to fighting, you need to find backup. The more people, the stronger the force. Otherwise, you'll just end up getting beaten down by others!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina is sweating profusely and wishes she could dig a hole and bury herself. Her daughter is shamelessly boasting about herself, and Lina wonders if her daughter is just carefree or completely oblivious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, okay, you don't need to continue speaking," Lina interrupted her own daughter's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Tina still had a feeling of wanting more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Tina's words explained why there were so many people involved in the fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's thin lips are tightly pursed at the moment, and there is a hint of anger on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his daughter's birthday party, the wife whom he had always taken great care of was insulted by someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though these individuals are still children, and even though they have some powerful connections, he will not allow his wife and daughter to be treated unfairly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please escort my guests out. The Hart family's banquet is unable to accommodate everyone," Brian said bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Psh, just leave already. What's so great about you guys? I'll have my dad come and smash the Hart family to pieces!" said one arrogant little boy who was around 7 or 8 years old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian sneered, "Fine, then I'll just wait and see what they can do to the Hart family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shawn, if you keep talking nonsense, do you want to be put in solitary confinement again?" Chandler said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, these people are all brought by him, and the reason for the incident is because they were mocking Auntie Valda's legs. Chandler feels partly responsible for this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Tina was beaten up like this. If he had arrived any later, who knows what state Tina would have been in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boy named Shawn suddenly fell silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler said to Brian, "Uncle Brian, Auntie Valda, I'm sorry today, I'm taking them away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler hasn't left with these kids yet, and suddenly Harley loudly exclaimed, "They haven't apologized yet! I won't let them speak ill of my mommy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several children's footsteps suddenly stopped, and one girl who was about the same age as Tina looked at her with disdain and said, "Your mommy's leg is already lame, can't we talk about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!" This time it was Jasmine who spoke. Although she usually gives off a quiet and gentle impression, right now she had a stern expression on her face and said angrily, "You can't speak ill of Auntie Valda!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because her mother had told her that Auntie Valda's limp was caused by saving her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the flood came, Auntie Valda put her in the escape basket, but Auntie Valda herself was washed away by the water and her leg hit a stone in the water, which made her limp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At her age, she actually has some understanding of what death is.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Death means there is nothing left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people are afraid of death. However, at that time, Auntie Valda chose death to save her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mom said that Auntie Valda is her lifesaver. Without Auntie Valda, she wouldn't be here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So she doesn't allow anyone to speak ill of Auntie Valda.</p></div>
