        <h1>Chapter 2380</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't forget. We're husband and wife. Since you want to go to Deer City while pregnant, as your husband, I ought to go too," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip slightly. "Okay, then... Then let's go together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was relieved at this. It would be better if Martin Weiss went with Kyla. In that case, he would be around to handle things if anything happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I'll go with you too. I&rsquo;ll be able to help in case there&rsquo;s a legal matter," said Grace. The main thing was that she was still worried about Kyla. After all, Kyla was pregnant, and her pregnancy was riskier than regular pregnancies. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked gratefully at Grace. "Grace, thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't mention it. This time, we have to find out whether Amber Mitchell is really mentally ill,&rdquo; said Grace. According to the information she obtained, it was indeed suspicious that Amber Mitchell was sent to a mental hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said to Jason at night, "Jay, I told Kyla I'll accompany her to Deer City today. Y-You won't blame me for making a decision before telling you, will you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows. "What if I do blame you for it? Are you leaving your husband and children for your friend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was embarrassed, "But I really want to help Kyla. I know how she feels. Especially now that the condition her friend Amber Mitchell is in... is a far cry from what Kyla described to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But have you ever wondered how long you might have to stay in Deer City if you want to help her? It may take more than a few days to resolve this," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been involved in the whole thing, so he knew how Amber Mitchell was doing in the mental hospital right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;m aware of that, so... I'm here to apologize to you," Grace said while wrapping her arms around Jason's neck. "I'll accompany Kyla to deal with the situation on hand first. If it's going to take a long time, I guess I'll just have to travel back and forth for a period of time. I can't exhaust the pregnant Kyla, can I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason gazed at the person in front of him. "A verbal apology isn't enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." With her eyes glimmering slightly, she stood on her tiptoes and kissed his lips. "Is this okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is a kiss all you have to offer?" He looked at her nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." She sprinkled more kisses on his cheek. "Is that enough to express my apology?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes grew darker as he gazed at her. His hoarse voice said with endless tenderness, "It&rsquo;s not enough... Not nearly enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As his voice ended, his big hand grabbed the back of her head, and his lips touched hers...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, Jason looked at the person leaning in his arms. He raised his hand and caressed her slightly untidy hair. "You can go ahead first. I'll come look for you after I take care of the matters in Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're going to Deer City too?" She was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Otherwise? Am I going to let you go to Deer City alone?"</p></div>
