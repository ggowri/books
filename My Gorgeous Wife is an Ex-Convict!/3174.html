        <h1>Chapter 3172</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really believe?" His gaze was fixed tightly on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She raised her eyebrows slightly and asked, "What do I need to do for you to truly believe that I believe you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gazed at her and with a slightly hoarse voice, he said, "So, love me a little more every day, love me to the point where you can't leave me, love me to the point where we are inseparable every day..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As his voice trailed off, he kissed her lips this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kiss carried endless tenderness and possessive desire, causing Valda to fall into it completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I will love you a little more every day..." she promised in this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Love him...until the end of life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before that, she will love this man more and more, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda gradually began to resume her work. She thought that after disappearing for a year, her studio would have been cleared out. However, she was surprised to find out that Brian had bought the entire floor for her and preserved her studio as it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even people were sent regularly to clean it, so when Valda came back to the studio, she found everything exactly the same as when she left, even without any dust in the room. Everything looked as if she had never left for a year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda couldn't help but smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian did a lot for her, but he never said anything about it. She always had to slowly discover it on her own, bit by bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sitting in front of her old familiar chair, Valda opened the notebook containing her sketches. Page by page, the sketches were all ideas she had once imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she made an agreement with Camille to resume the serialization, it has been a year since she last drew anything. Therefore, she needs to take some time to get back into the groove and strive to restore her skills as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda started tidying up the things in the studio when she heard footsteps behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, why did you come over now?" She turned around and asked. They had just talked on the phone and he had said he would come to pick her up after his meeting ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So at this moment, Valda naturally thought that Brian had walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only face that met her gaze as she turned around was that of Raymond Bowman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This man whom she once had a crush on, also made her experience the darkest moments of being attacked and criticized, leaving deep scars in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't expect him to come to her studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How...did you come here?" Valda asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I came to take a look and didn't expect to find you here today," Raymond said with a slightly awkward expression. He didn't mention that he had bribed the building's security guards to notify him if Valda returned to the studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, when she came to the studio today, the security downstairs also notified him by phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he received the call, he immediately put down his work and rushed over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I went to your place, but you weren't there," said Raymond. After the news about her had spread all over the internet, he found out that she had already returned to Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he went to her place to look for her, he didn't find her there. All he saw was a tightly closed door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He even stayed in front of her door all night, but never saw the person he was looking for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So she should be living with Brian now, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew the answer, which was the most normal answer possible. Nowadays, she was already Brian's fianc&eacute;e, as he had admitted himself. However, in his heart, there would still be waves of sourness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like some people, even though they know they don't belong to each other anymore, they still feel a lot of pain when they think about how they were once so close to each other, just one step away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If at that time, he had not been deceived and had taken Valda's feelings for him seriously, perhaps their relationship would not have ended up as it is now.</p></div>
