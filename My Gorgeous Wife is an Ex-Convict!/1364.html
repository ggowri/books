        <h1>Chapter 1363</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Blowing out the candles, his thin lips parted softly. "I wish&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was about to go on when she suddenly raised her hand to his lips. "Don't say it. It won't come true if you say it out loud."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gently put down her hand. "But didn't you say you&rsquo;ll make whatever wish of mine come true as long as you can do it? If I don't say it out loud, how are you going to make my wishes come true?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Those are wishes. I can grant you three wishes, but your birthday wishes should be... things God can help you to achieve. For example, growing your business or living a long life," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he said, "Both my wishes and birthday wishes are all related to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he looked down and gently pried open her forefinger and made a &lsquo;1&rsquo; gesture while holding her hand. "My first wish is for you to celebrate my birthday with me every year until I die."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he stretched out her middle finger and made a &lsquo;2&rsquo; gesture. "My second wish is for you to never leave me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was silent after saying that. He kept looking at her hand but did not say out the third wish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's your third wish?" Grace could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't tell you my third wish for now. I'll tell you when I really need to. However, if I do tell you the third wish, are you sure you'll do it if you can?" he murmured. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked up and gazed at her. "Then it's settled. You'll do it when the time comes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What is it that's so mysterious?" She was curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled and said nothing, but there was a hint of sadness hiding in the depths of his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only hoped he would never need to use the third wish&mdash;which was if she found out the truth one day, then he hoped she would forgive him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Forgive him for his indifference and inaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How many times had he wished he could go back in time, back to before her accident so he could protect her from any harm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, you can keep it to yourself. By the way, look at the birthday present I got for you!" Grace said as she took out the present she prepared and gave it to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were two simple T-shirts with cartoons depicting a man and a woman. The woman's belly was obviously bulging and she was a pregnant woman. The expressions of the man and the woman well captured the features of the characters. Although there were only a few simple strokes, the little cartoons were very similar to Jason and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I drew this. Do they look like us? One is for you and one is for me. It's our matching family outfits. I'll draw the kids after they're born and print them on T-shirts," she said cheerfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect you to be good at drawing cartoons," he said approvingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I liked to draw cartoons when I was at school. I also made comics, but I haven&rsquo;t drawn for a long time since then and got a little rusty. I secretly practiced it for a while. Luckily, the drawings look good on T-shirts," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gaze fell on her hands when he heard that. Due to her hands, she now wrote slower than the average person. Besides, there was already a clear difference from her previous beautiful handwriting, not to mention when she was drawing. </p></div>
