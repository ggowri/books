        <h1>Chapter 236</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She should be afraid of him, right? He was a man who could easily grasp her pain and embarrassment. His words could easily knock her into hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, why did she feel out of control when he was so close to her and when he was breathing in her ear?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This man was simply too much for her. Even if he called her &lsquo;sis&rsquo;, in the end, she was only a pawn in his hand. She was a chess piece for entertainment in his spare time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, on the other hand, looked down and picked up the picture frame on the bedside table. He looked at the person in the picture&ndash;those apricot eyes were looking ahead while the corners of her lips were curling upwards, smiling lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her beautiful face made people feel some sort of comfortable peace and elegance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he had acquired something he never thought of before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis," Jason muttered softly as he ran his fingers over the lips of the person in the frame. Then, as if unable to restrain himself, he kissed the lips in the picture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just now... If it had not been for the stiffness of her body, if it had not been for the flicker of fear in her face, he might indeed have kissed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He, however, chose to suppress his desires.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why was that? Was it because it scared her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had already scared her at the rented house today, so he could not bear to scare her a second time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gently closed his eyes, and a smile faintly emerged at the corners of his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought she might not be able to sleep at all on her first night in the house, but actually, she slept so well that she feared she would sleep forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe it was because so many things had happened that day that she was so exhausted. Perhaps she did not have the energy to do anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the time on her phone. It was five o'clock in the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She needed to be at the Sanitation Service Center by six.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurriedly changed her clothes and went into the bathroom for a quick wash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she came out, she found Jason sitting on the dresser in her room, playing with her mobile phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is Sis going to work?" He looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Grace replied, taking her phone out of his hand and putting it in her bag. She then picked it up and wanted to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's have breakfast together." He clasped her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll be late for work." She was in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled. "If I say Sis will be on time, then Sis will be on time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gasped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They reached the dining room downstairs where Grace was surprised to find that breakfast was already served.</p></div>
