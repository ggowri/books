        <h1>Chapter 3750</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Mason didn't have the driver pick her up from school much in the next two days, the rumors at school became more and more severe. Someone even posted a photo of the driver picking her up on the school forum and started a petition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, why don't you have your friend come to school and explain that it was just the driver picking you up? Some people at school are speaking too harshly." Shirley advised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, this kind of rumor is more harmful to women.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll explain it to the forum administrator and have them delete the post." Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, her and Mason's relationship was only in the ambiguous stage, and they weren't officially dating. If he came to school to explain anything, it might actually drag him down, and it could have a negative impact on his reputation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that case, would he feel that being with her is more trouble than it's worth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During class in the afternoon, Veronica ran into Vanessa's group again. Vanessa, surrounded by her friends, walked up to Veronica and glared at her fiercely. "Don't get too cocky. Do you think I'm just going to let that incident go? Let me tell you, you won't graduate properly. Soon, you'll be expelled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you talking about! Veronica is fine. Why should she be expelled!" Shirley spoke up for her friend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? Because she's being kept by someone! She's ruining the school's reputation. Why shouldn't she be expelled!" Vanessa said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's right! You should have dropped out a long time ago!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, you look so innocent, how could you do something so shameless?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her group of girlfriends chimed in agreement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shameless? From my perspective, what you're doing now is shameless!" Veronica retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are we doing? You're the one doing shameless things!" Vanessa said fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What you're doing now is bullying and being unrealistic in your words and actions," Veronica stood her ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine, say what you want. Your abilities are limited, I'm waiting to see you get expelled!" Vanessa and her group left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shirley looked at Veronica with concern, "Veronica, this seems like it's going to get worse. Why do they suddenly hate you so much?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica knew the reason why Vanessa and her group hated her, but it wasn't convenient to tell Shirley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They probably just don't like me," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never really thought about dropping out...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the next day, she was called into the school office by the school leaders. Besides her homeroom teacher, there was also the grade director and department head.</span></p></div>
