        <h1>Chapter 2468</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gloom flickered on his face. "Yeah, I don't understand you. But Herman Moss understood you, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nostalgia flickered in Amber Mitchell's eyes. "Yes, he understood me, but I didn't understand him at the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she learned to understand that man, he had disappeared from this world forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she said made George Gregory&rsquo;s face darken instantly. He hurried over to her bed and grabbed her jaw. "Amber Mitchell, you have no shame. If you thought he understood you, why did you accept my proposal? Were you trying to get the best of both worlds? You enjoy being chased by men, don't you? But it made me the joke of Deer City!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said indifferently, "I'm not as shameless as you are. I was forced into a mental hospital, but you married Louise Mitchell only three months later. Four months later, your baby was born and announced to have been born prematurely. But I'm afraid you know very well whether the baby was born prematurely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory instantly felt awkward. It was as if he could not hide his mistake from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he got upset after seeing her with Herman Moss that night many years ago, he happened to run into Louise Mitchell. He knew that Louise Mitchell was in love with him, but he had always been dismissive of Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he seemed to want to get back at Amber Mitchell by drinking and spending the night with Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Amber Mitchell was admitted to the mental hospital, Louise Mitchell looked for him with a hospital test report. She told him that she was pregnant with his baby. He could test the baby&rsquo;s DNA after the baby was born if he did not believe her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Eventually, he married Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because it did not matter to him who he married back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, are you blaming me? If you hadn't gotten involved with Herman Moss and been unloyal, how could I have married Louise Mitchell? Amber Mitchell, you brought all this upon yourself!" He snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I brought all this upon myself?" Amber Mitchell sneered. "So, you let me get locked up in there even though you knew I wasn't mentally ill?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had shouted this sentence in her head countless times! She had thought of asking him this question face to face countless times!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her voice was so calm that it even surprised her when she finally asked the question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she was like this because she was truly disappointed in him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was incredibly calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory almost subconsciously tried to avoid Amber Mitchell's gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He deliberately stopped himself from thinking about her. However, when someone told him that she had become mentally ill because she missed Herman Moss so much and was forced to stay in the hospital for treatment, he felt jealous and resentful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He hated her for loving Herman Moss so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It... had occurred to him that maybe she was being framed. After all, the biggest beneficiary of her forced hospitalization was the Mitchell family and Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this idea was soon drowned out by his hatred. Later, he gradually grew numb and brainwashed himself into believing she was mentally ill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her question now embarrassed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a preliminary diagnosis from the doctor. You haven't had a consultation with specialists." His voice broke as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell smiled faintly. "Yeah, so am I still a mental patient to you, George Gregory? Don't you think it's ridiculous for you to be talking to a mental patient, then?&rdquo; </p></div>
