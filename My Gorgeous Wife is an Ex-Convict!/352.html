        <h1>Chapter 351</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who is he, Miss Sweeney?" asked Carl Motley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, tell him. Who am I?" Hadwin said as he looked at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, both men were looking at her. Lina felt as if she was about to be badly pricked by the two men's gazes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One was the blind date her mother snatched while the other one was her newly appointed boyfriend who came to collect her debt. She could not afford to offend either of them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after comparing the two, she would choose the one with lesser damage. Compared to her mother who was behind the man, Lina still felt that Hadwin could not be offended, so she smiled rather lamely and said to Carl Motley, "I almost forgot, Mr. Motley. This is my boyfriend. Uh, his last name is Stephenson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Carl Motley's face immediately took on a ghastly expression. "Boyfriend? You have a boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes... Yes, I do..." Lina answered him guiltily. No matter how strange Carl Motley was before, in this case, she was at fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Carl Motley was shaking with anger. His face was red when he shouted at Lina, "I was kind enough to go on a blind date with you, but you already have a boyfriend. You've gone too far. You must give me an explanation. How dare you make a fool of me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Carl Motley shouted and stepped forward to grab Lina's collar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Lina could avoid him, someone's hand had already stopped Carl Motley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who said you could touch her?" Hadwin said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What, do you want to fight me?" Carl Motley asked angrily. "You'd better watch out with a woman like her. Since she went on a blind date with me behind your back today, who knows if she'll be sleeping behind your back tomorrow? She might look obedient, but who knows what happens behind the scenes. Maybe she has some shady business going on..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina rolled up her sleeves and wanted to hit him as he was crossing the line. The next moment, there was a loud smack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina stared at Hadwin who was shaking his hand... He hit the man before she did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you just... hit me?" Carl Motley glared at Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Believe it or not, if you say one more word about her, I can assure you there won't be a tooth left in your mouth," Hadwin said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Carl Motley trembled and suddenly felt fear from the bottom of his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He subconsciously wanted to fight back. He opened his mouth to say more, but his voice seemed to be stuck in his throat even though his mouth was open. The words could not get out no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin's face darkened, and he immediately pulled Lina away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was still a little confused and followed him in a daze. However, Hadwin's pace got faster and faster. She almost had to jog to keep up with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Slow&hellip; Slow down," she said. She would have stopped if he had not taken her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin suddenly stopped in his tracks and Lina immediately hit him on the back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ouch! She held her nose as if she had just hit an iron plate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"At least give me a hint before stopping," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A hint?" Hadwin suddenly sneered and turned to stare at the woman in front of him. "Then you should give me a hint. Why go on blind dates when you have a boyfriend? Are you used to cheating?"</p></div>
