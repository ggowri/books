        <h1>Chapter 3810</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Repeated failures left Veronica panting and her legs were extremely sore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't give up, she had to survive. She must survive!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not just for herself, but also for those who had been good to her, and...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's face appeared in her mind, causing her to let out a long sigh and continue with her previous actions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important thing now was to save herself, not to risk Mason's life to save her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after who knows how long, Veronica's fingers finally hooked onto the shoe, and her tense heart finally calmed down a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Next, she had to remove the heel from the sole of the shoe and use the head of the shoe nail to rub against the rope to break it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the heel was already a bit loose, separating it from the shoe still required a lot of effort, especially since this kind of work would normally require tools.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she not only had no tools, but was also in this position, which meant she needed to use even more strength to do this job...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would succeed, she must succeed, Veronica kept encouraging herself in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason always felt uneasy. One night, he received a text message on his phone, it was from Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had deleted her phone number from his phone, he still remembered it in his mind and couldn't forget it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, when he saw the number on the text message, he knew it was from Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The content of the message invited him to go to their old high school tomorrow, because tomorrow was the day when the old high school site would be completely demolished.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason looked at the text message on his phone, feeling a bit distracted. High school?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the last memories of high school were not good memories. Ever since Veronica chose to date Daniel back then, his high school life had been a mess.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, what did Veronica mean by sending this text message? Did she really just want to see the old campus being demolished with him? Or was there some other purpose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some reason, he felt a sense of unease in his heart, causing him to feel restless and anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, his gaze fell on a certain line of text in the message, and his eyes changed. He seemed to be pondering something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, he replied to the message on his phone, "Okay, let's meet for the last time tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, Daniel looked at the message from Mason with a satisfied smile on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tomorrow, there would be a good show to watch. He would make sure that Mason </span><span>and Veronica would both meet their end!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not only would this relieve his hatred, but he could also leave the country afterwards and start a new life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would never let himself be trapped in this muddy life again, struggling to get out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p></div>
