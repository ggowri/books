        <h1>Chapter 4183 Worry</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, she's still alive. She must be." Chandler murmured. "But I need to find her. I need to find her quickly..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia was becoming speechless listening to Chandler's words. If Tina couldn't be found, or... if they only found Tina's body in the end, would this man break down?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia didn't dare to imagine further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A deep sense of guilt spread through her body once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This guilt had almost completely overwhelmed her these past few days!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Thud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She knelt directly in front of Chandler. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Chandler, I couldn't hold onto Tina. It's my fault. Tina came to save me, but I couldn't save her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If it wasn't for her, Tina wouldn't have been swept away by the water, and her fate wouldn't still be unknown!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's gaze, at this moment, finally fell on Eugenia. "Yes, why didn't you hold onto her? If you had held onto her, she wouldn't have been carried away by the current!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A chill suddenly surged up Eugenia's spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> That icy gaze was as if it wanted to kill her, making her feel like she couldn't breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm... I'm sorry..." At this moment, Eugenia didn't know what else she should do besides continuously apologize!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Sorry?" Chandler sneered. "At this point, what use is it for you to apologize to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As he finished speaking, he reached out his hand and grabbed Eugenia's throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In an instant, Eugenia couldn't breathe, her face turning red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's subordinates rushed forward, wanting to stop him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But Chandler held on tightly, and they couldn't pry his hand off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia tried to struggle, but in the next moment, she gave up. Yes, at this point, what use was it for her to apologize?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If Chandler really wanted to take her life, then maybe she could go underground and accompany Tina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just as Eugenia thought she was going to die, suddenly, the fingers on her neck loosened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her legs went weak, and she sat down on the deck, choking uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler looked down at her from above, seeming to cry and laugh at the same time. "If you die, Tina will be sad, right? You're the person Tina risked her life to save. Hahaha... She saved you but forgot about me. How could she make that kind of choice, how could she!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's voice, choked with despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It pained Eugenia deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If it had been her who died back then, would things be better?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina wouldn't be in trouble, and Chandler wouldn't be so desperate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina, she must still be alive, right...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But where exactly is she?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Can we really find Tina?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If we can't find Tina, then what will happen to Chandler... Eugenia can't bear to imagine!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And the Hunter family members share the same fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Colin and Adele are filled with worry, and the old Mr. Hunter ended up in the hospital because of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, for the Hunter family, Tina is not just a daughter-in-law, but also the person who can save Chandler's life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Now that Tina's whereabouts are unknown, what should Chandler do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> What the Hunter family is truly worried about now is... whether Chandler's life can be saved!</p></div>
