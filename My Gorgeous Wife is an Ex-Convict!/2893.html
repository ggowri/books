        <h1>Chapter 2891</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Brian Hart's phone suddenly rang, and he glanced at the caller ID, furrowing his brows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? Whose call is it?" Patrick Weiss asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's my father's call. He wants me to come back for a visit. It seems that it's for the same reason as you coming to find me today," Brian Hart replied nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that The Cross Family has come to beg at your doorstep," Patrick Weiss remarked, indicating that The Cross Family is really struggling now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian Hart returned to the Hart Mansion, he saw his parents sitting on the sofa in the living room waiting for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's going on with The Cross Family? I heard that you stopped their loan funding from the bank," Mr. Hart asked his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I cut off The Cross Family's funding," Brian Hart admitted generously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you trying to do? Are you trying to take revenge on The Cross Family?" Mr. Hart was puzzled. "Today, even the old Mr. Cross came to me and asked you to let The Cross Family go. If The Cross Family really did something wrong, they are willing to make up for it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Make up for it?" Brian Hart sneered. How could The Cross Family make up for it? The suffering and pain that Valda Theller had endured, "Unless time can be turned back, they can't make up for anything!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Hart sighed, "The old Mr. Cross said that Phoebe offended you and sent someone to play a prank on your girlfriend. It's just a small matter. You don't have to make it so big. If you work so hard to bring down The Cross Family, it won't benefit the Hart family much even if they really fall."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Hart was speaking from a business perspective.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What Phoebe Cross did to Valda Theller is a big deal to me," Brian Hart said seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But it's just a woman," Mr. Hart frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But this woman is important to me! Dad, anyone who hurts Valda Theller, I will make them pay the price." Even himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, he also hurt Valda Theller, so he is now paying the price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You-" Mr. Hart looked at his son in surprise. It was clear that his son's words were not just empty talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Madam Hart, on the other hand, was overjoyed. If her son really likes this girlfriend so much, it means that he has let go of Grace and will not be obsessed with her anymore. This means that they have a chance to have grandchildren.</p></div>
