        <h1>Chapter 815</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who is it? Who said that?' It was so sweet but so sad that she wanted to shed tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll protect you forever. I won't let you suffer the slightest injustice and let anyone hurt you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's... Jay&rsquo;s voice... It's what Jay once said to me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace squatted on the ground and felt that all she could hear were the words Jason had once said to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't think about these words. Don't think about them&hellip;' she kept telling herself in her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then... It seemed that there was the sound of footsteps. The pattering of footsteps sounded so clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Whose footsteps are these?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A pair of black leather shoes caught her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She slowly raised her head and caught sight of the familiar face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's Jay&rsquo;s face... Just like the one I saw in Drunken Days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because I'm drunk? Is that why I&rsquo;m hearing voices and also hallucinating?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace staggered to her feet, half-crying and half-laughing at the figure in front of her as she said, "Don't&hellip; show your face to me again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt even worse when he showed up. He made her calm mind fluctuate again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared at the person in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she drunk?' There was no clarity in her almond-shaped eyes and her cheeks were red. She stood swaying as if she would fall to the ground the next moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stepped forward and put his hand around her waist to keep her from falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his action made her frown, and a flash of pain came over her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it still hurting?" She realized at once that his hand was now resting on the same spot on her waist where she had been kicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the scene of that man kicking her came into mind, he felt that he had gone too easy on the man to have just crippled one of his legs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the person in front of her with misty eyes. 'He's asking me if it hurts... I'm in pain. How could I not be in pain?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was in pain when she got kicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that pain seemed to be better than this pain of seeing him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jay... Jay...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days, she kept telling herself to forget him, but she would always dream of him at night. Then, she would wake up with wet eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what&hellip; if it hurts?" She smiled stupidly and suddenly put her hands around Jason's neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's body stiffened immediately, but he did not push Grace away. He just lowered his head and stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence, who had been following Jason, was frightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What is&hellip; Master Reed going to do? He has been following Miss Cummins out of Drunken Days, and now... he&rsquo;s just standing there with her around his neck.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since it was Master Reed who broke up with Miss Cummins at the beginning, Terrence knew that with Master Reed's character, there was no room for change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the scene now... made him a little unsure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled. Her drunken smile in the night was so beautiful that Jason could not turn his eyes away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she gently laid her hand playfully upon his cheek, over his forehead, nose, cheek, lips, and finally, on his eyelashes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, tell me... Why are your eyelashes... so beautiful... They're so beautiful that I'm&hellip; I'm jealous..." she said aimlessly.</p></div>
