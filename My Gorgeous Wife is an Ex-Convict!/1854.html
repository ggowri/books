        <h1>Chapter 1852</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts wanted to stop them, but there were bodyguards around him and he could not get close to Mrs. Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace also wanted to step forward, but Jason still held her hand tightly. She could not walk over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay!" she said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, don't plead for her!" Jason whispered in a voice that sounded like a warning but also a plea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze. Looking at Jason's misty eyes, she felt as though some of her words were stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was not ignorant of the trauma his mother had caused him and even how his hatred for his mother after his father&rsquo;s death had fueled him to go on with life. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even the scar on his chest was caused by his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She once hated his mother too. She hated his mother for abandoning a man who loved her so deeply and leaving a child who so desperately begged her to stay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If his mother had not left so ruthlessly, Jay's childhood would not have been so painful! Jay's father would not have chosen death either!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when it turned out that this woman, whom she should hate, was Mrs. Watts, the same woman who had taken care of her and Jasper in the past few years, Grace only felt an indescribable contradiction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts's kindness and gentleness were far from what she knew Jay's mother to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, what Mrs. Watts used to say most was, "Having sufficient money to spend is good enough. What matters most is my family's safety."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Was Mrs. Watts someone who once risked everything to get into a rich and powerful family and then abandoned her husband and son when she had no hope of getting in?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Just kowtow. Kowtow to my father and see if he&rsquo;s willing to forgive you!" Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two bodyguards were about to knock Mrs. Watts's head against the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I'll kowtow myself. I'll apologize to Kim myself!" said Mrs. Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two bodyguards then looked at Jason and let go when they saw no response from their boss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts started to kowtow at the tombstone. Once, twice, thrice... The kowtows sounded particularly loud in the cemetery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts shouted at Jason, "Jason, let your mother go! She has been having a hard time all these years. Not a day goes by that she doesn't regret the way she left you and your father. She has already been punished. The hamstring on her leg was cut, and her face was disfigured. These were her punishments..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, no matter what Old Lawyer Watts said, Jason remained indifferent. He only coldly watched Mrs. Watts kotow repeatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing that his wife's forehead had started bleeding, Old Lawyer Watts quickly said to Grace, "Grace, she... She's Jason's mother, but she's also my wife. Please plead for her and let her stop!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew about the guilt in his wife's heart. If Jason did not stop her, his wife would not stop no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze. The next moment, she felt the fingers on her wrist tighten a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jay...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She looked down at the hand that was holding her wrist. She knew Jay would never want her to plead for his mother.</p></div>
