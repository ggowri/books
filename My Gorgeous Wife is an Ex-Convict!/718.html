        <h1>Chapter 717</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then did Brian seem to notice Stella Lindsay. Sadness immediately flashed in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's wrong with me? Stella is right here. What else do I suspect?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or should I say... What am I hoping for?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's fingers finally let go little by little, and Grace quickly pulled back her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a gloomy face, Jason carried Grace in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I can walk by myself," Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You just had a headache. It'll be better if I carry you to the car," Jason said as he strode off toward the fair's exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian watched on until they disappeared from his sight. Then, he lowered his eyes and saw the red marks on his wrists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the spot where Grace and Jason had gripped him so tightly earlier, but he only felt the pain in his wrist now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, are you alright? Does it hurt?" Stella Lindsay looked at Brian's wrist with pain, then said with indignation, "That Jason is way out of line. If he did break your hand, I'd even sacrifice my life to get justice for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke as if she was so brave and was willing to do anything for Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in Brian's ears, her words sounded funny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he was facing Jason, Stella dared not ask Jason a question!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this woman really the girl who sacrificed her life to save me when we were little?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned to look at Stella Lindsay and said, "Stella, when you and I were in the hills when we were kids, I almost fell off a cliff once and you held my hand tightly. Do you remember what you said back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay became nervous immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could I remember? I'm not the one who did it! Besides, when we were little, Grace did not tell me in detail everything they had said to each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Furthermore, even if Grace had said it, I just listened and didn't keep it in mind. How would I remember it after all these years?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the face of Brian's inquiring eyes, Stella Lindsay could only smile awkwardly and say, "It's been so long, I&rsquo;ve kind of forgotten. However, I do remember saving you in the end, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled faintly. "Yes, you saved me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why has she forgotten what she said to me but Grace was able to say it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was carried into the car by Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove toward Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the car, Jason rubbed the red marks on Grace's wrist gently and asked, "Does it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's much better now," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not hold her hands very hard. On the contrary, she held Brian's hands with a stronger grip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about your head? Does it still hurt?" he asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shook her head. "The pain&rsquo;s gone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why were you with Brian?" he asked in a casual tone, but when the question escaped his mouth, he could clearly feel her body stiffening.</p></div>
