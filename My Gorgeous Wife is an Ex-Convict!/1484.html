        <h1>Chapter 1483</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The moment she said so, his eyes seemed to sparkle like bright stars. They were shimmering, and a beautiful smile appeared on the corners of his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You thought of me... You thought of me..." he muttered as if he was excited. There were tears in his beautiful peach blossom eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She looked at his excited face and momentarily fell into a trance. 'Could a word from me make him behave like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I know he loves me, and there&rsquo;s no doubt about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And I love him too. Don't I?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Let's eat first. The food is going to get cold if we don't," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, let's eat first. It's our first time spending Chinese New Year together. You'll have New Year's Eve dinner with me every year after this as well, right?" he asked, looking nervous and hopeful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew what he wanted to hear, and she did not want to see him disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, we'll have New Year's Eve dinner together every year onward," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was a promise, but it also fulfilled his expectations and desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next moment, two streams of tears suddenly poured out of Jason's eyes and rolled down his face. He was crying, but the corners of his lips were smiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His smile was like the most beautiful scenery in springtime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">For a moment, Grace only felt waves of pain in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It took them quite some time to finish New Year's Eve dinner because of Jason's crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... want to watch the Spring Festival Gala show later. Will you watch it with me?" said Grace. Speaking of which, she had not watched the Spring Festival Gala show in years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She vaguely recalled watching the Spring Festival Gala show in her grandmother's arms when she was a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Later, she returned to her so-called home in tMason Swansonty. However, it was always her father, stepmother, and sister, Evelyn, who gathered in front of the TV and watched the show on New Year's Eve. She was like an outsider, never fitting in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was only during the two years she was dating Sean that they made a conscious effort to be nice to her, but she had never felt like they were one family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason replied, "Okay. I'll watch it with you if you want to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At eight o&rsquo;clock, the show began!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace and Jason sat on the living room couch and watched the show on the huge TV screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was an experience Grace had never had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She seemed to have peace of mind now. This moment felt similar to how she used to watch the show with her grandmother, but... there were still some differences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe it was because... Jay was not only her family but also the person she loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the show got to the singing and dancing segment, Grace suddenly turned her head and looked at Jason who was sitting next to her. "Jay, I'll... try to forget about what happened in the past."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason shuddered suddenly. There was shock, surprise, and expectation but also nervousness in his eyes as he looked at her... "Grace, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Could it be what I think it is? Is it possible?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At the moment, he was like a man waiting for a trial. He was so nervous he was almost at a loss.</p></div>
