        <h1>Chapter 1249</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sat in the car and watched Grace's receding figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Little did she know that it was not just her life at stake this time, but also his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lived if she lived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If anything happened to her, he would stay with her. Since she wanted to gamble, then he would gamble his future with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace arrived at Lina's ward, which was also an ICU ward. However, it was relatively separate, and there was a room next to the ward where family members could spend the night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could say that the environment and conditions here were much better than the previous hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney thanked Grace repeatedly when they saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uncle and Aunt, you don't have to thank me like this. Lina sacrificed so much for me back then. I'm just doing what I should," said Grace, concerned about her best friend's condition. "What did the doctor say? Did they say when Lina would be out of danger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They didn't say when she would be out of danger. It might take some time, but they said they will consult with the best doctors in the country and abroad. There are likely to be better treatments. Besides... we have a much wider selection of drugs now," Mr. Sweeney said gratefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, they were financially restricted, so even though they wanted to save their daughter, they could not afford to use expensive medicines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the hospital now told them that they could give their daughter the most expensive drugs, all of which would be paid for by Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They naturally understood that Jason would pay for it because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good," said Grace as she looked through the clear glass window at her best friend lying in the ICU bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had so many things she wanted to say to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to tell Lina that she was pregnant with triplets. She wanted to tell Lina that she would work very hard to give birth to these three children so they would have a godmother later on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did the police find out how Lina got hurt?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney looked a little sorrowful again. "Not yet." They also wanted to know what the truth was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, their daughter was now in a coma, and there were no other clues. The truth seemed to be in a fog.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about Hadwin Stephenson? Have you heard from him?" Grace asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. and Mrs. Sweeney shook their heads. "We've also asked the police about this. They said he's still missing. They'll inform us if they hear from him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson should be the key to everything. Lina had gone to look for Hadwin Stephenson, but no one knew if Hadwin Stephenson was alive or dead now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Hadwin Stephenson cared about Lina to the extent that he would have called her even if he did not know that Lina was seriously injured. Unless... he could not even call!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had a strong sense of unease. She only hoped that things were not as bad as she imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, Lina would not be able to take it when she woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she got out of the hospital, Grace got a call from an unfamiliar phone number. "Is this Miss Grace? The dress Miss Lina custom-made for you is done. You can come and pick it up anytime."</p></div>
