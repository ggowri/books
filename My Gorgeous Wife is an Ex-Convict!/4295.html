        <h1>Chapter 4293 No Divorce</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was stunned for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yeah, why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had asked herself the same question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she saw him suffering so much from the curse, all she could think about was how to make him feel better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even forgot about his past deception and the fact that she should hate him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to see the person I used to love suffer like that." After a long while, she gave this answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smirked and laughed, "You said it yourself, it's just 'used to love'. Since you don't love me anymore and we're divorced, we have no relationship besides Quinn. </span><span>So</span><span> my affairs have nothing to do with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words were another rejection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It does matter!" Tina took a deep breath and looked directly at him. "We are not </span><span>divorced,</span><span> you are still my husband!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" His response was like thunder, shocking Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina bit her lip. "Yes, we are not divorced yet. I haven't submitted the divorce papers, so legally, we are still married!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler took a long time to speak. "Why haven't you submitted the papers?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know." She awkwardly admitted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But that was the truth. She really didn't understand why she hadn't submitted the papers, considering that she was the one who wanted the divorce!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because every time she thought about their divorce, she felt a sense of emptiness in her heart. She was afraid that she would regret it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her memories were to return in the future, she might regret divorcing him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Chandler looked at Tina in front of him, his emotions gradually calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, you don't want me to be affected by the curse anymore and want to have another child to lift the curse. I appreciate that. But I don't want to have another child just because of that. It would make me greedy and give me false hope. It would make me selfish and take away things I shouldn't take."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You probably don't know how much self-control I need to ignore you when you appear in front of me, and how much self-control I need to have a calm conversation with you as if nothing happened. It's a delicate balance that I have finally managed to maintain, and once it's broken, I don't think I can do it again!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina listened in astonishment. She didn't expect Chandler to say such things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're restraining yourself even now?" she asked in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," he replied. "Every time you appear in front of me, it feels like a test. </span><span>So</span><span> I hope you can try not to appear in front of me as much as possible."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina suddenly felt a pain in her heart when she heard his words. This pain seemed to be growing stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> it hurts so much when he keeps rejecting her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In that case, don't restrain yourself!" The words blurted out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was stunned. "Did you understand the consequences of what I just said?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understood!" she said. "</span><span>So</span><span> I think, since that's the case, let's try to start over. Just this once, without any more lies! Don't be nice to me or treat me gently just because I can lift the curse for you!"</span></p></div>
