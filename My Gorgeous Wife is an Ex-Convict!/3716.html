        <h1>Chapter 3714</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that there seemed to be a real connection between Mason and his daughter, Archer didn't want to embarrass himself in front of Mason. After all, he still wanted to rely on the Reed family to make a comeback. He planned to cover up this matter for now and deal with it later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Veronica did not comply with his wishes. "I'm not throwing a tantrum. I'm serious. Our father-daughter relationship is cut off from now on. I won't treat you as my father anymore, and you don't have to treat me as your daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer was so angry that he wanted to hit someone, but he restrained himself because Mason was present. "Cut off the relationship? Can you cut it off if you want to?!" he said fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica gritted her teeth and refused to give in. "Even if it's difficult, I still want to cut it off."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then try it. You can't cut it off legally! You're my biological daughter!" Archer said viciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she wants to cut it off, then let her cut it off," a cold and indifferent voice suddenly sounded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everyone was stunned. Veronica didn't expect Mason to suddenly say this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer and Rosalind looked stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason...what do you mean by that?" Archer asked nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she really wants to cut ties with you as her father, then you should just let it be. </span><span>There's nothing that can't be cut off," Mason said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer's face changed. "But legally..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Legally, it's just a piece of paper. It doesn't mean anything. Even if you're legally father and daughter, you can still go your whole lives without seeing each other, can't you?" Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer was at a loss for words facing a younger generation, especially one he had watched grow up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if everything was under the other person's control, leaving him with no room for resistance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Cold sweat broke out on Archer's forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalind was about to say something, but Archer grabbed her and said, "Let's go back first." They hurriedly left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When they got downstairs, Rosalind asked, "Why didn't you let me speak?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to say? Don't forget, that person is Mason!" Archer said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what? He used to live with us for so many years. I'm still his Auntie Rosalind!" Rosalind said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He calls you Auntie Rosalind because of Veronica's relationship. If Veronica cuts ties with us, do you think he'll still call you that?" Archer said irritably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalind was speechless for a while before saying, "So we just let that girl cut ties with us? If she really does, don't expect to rely on the Reed family again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, let's go back first. We'll think of a solution later," Archer said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Veronica looked at Mason standing in front of her and asked nervously, "How did you come here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't we agree to try it out?" he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" She suddenly came to her senses and said, "Yes...we did agree to try it out..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She licked her dry lips and pressed her fingers on the password lock. While entering the password to unlock the door, she asked, "Do you want to come in?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he walked into the room again and sat on the sofa in the living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want tea or a drink? I have juice and cola here," she said nervously as she watched him sitting quietly in her living room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Everything felt so unreal and surreal.</span></p></div>
