        <h1>Chapter 4194 Can she forgive?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In the end, he didn't have the courage to tell her that he wasn't the person she used to love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After uttering that lie, he knew that it would continue until the day it could no longer be hidden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> At night, Kit lay in bed, looking at Tina lying on the other bed, already sound asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She slept peacefully nearby, and he could even reach out and touch her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It all felt like a dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If he closed his eyes and fell asleep now, would it all cease to exist when he woke up tomorrow?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina, will you really forgive me in the future?" he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But even if it was just a fleeting dream, for him, it was an unattainable dream under normal circumstances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although he knew that one day it would be revealed, for now, he wanted to continue this dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even... if this dream would only last for a few short days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> ------------</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The next day, when Tina woke up, she felt refreshed and hadn't slept so well in a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After freshening up, Kit took her downstairs for breakfast, and then brought her to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, in the hospital, Kit used a stranger's ID to register her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why are you using someone else's ID to register?" she curiously asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Your ID is lost, and if you need to get a new one, it takes time. For now, we'll temporarily use someone else's for the convenience of checking your pregnancy status," Kit replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In reality, he didn't dare take Tina to get a new ID.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If they really went to the relevant authorities to get a new one... his lie would no longer be able to continue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The Stephenson family and the Hunter family would undoubtedly receive the news immediately and come to pick her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And he just wanted to spend a few more days with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> At the hospital, Tina had a prenatal check-up. The result showed that the baby in her belly was slightly underdeveloped, about three weeks behind the normal growth for its age. This was likely due to malnutrition considering Tina's previous nutritional condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As long as the nutrition is supplemented, the baby's growth will naturally catch up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After the check-up, Kit took Tina to the mall. Yesterday, he only bought a few clothes temporarily, but in his opinion, it was far from enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He wanted to give her more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina, on the other hand, thought the clothes she bought yesterday were enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yesterday, I just randomly picked two pieces, but those two are not enough. You can choose more that you like, and besides clothes and shoes, you can also look for other things you like. However, this mall is a bit small. I'll take you to the city in a few days. There are more malls there, and they are bigger, with more brands inside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina couldn't help but say, "You are too good to me. I don't know what to do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit looked at Tina with tender eyes. "I'm afraid I'm not good enough to you. I only want to be better to you... to give you everything I can!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was stunned. The tears she had shed in the village and the sweetness this man gave her now seemed like two extremes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And the way he looked at her was so gentle, as if his eyes were filled with nothing but her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This man really loves her!</p></div>
