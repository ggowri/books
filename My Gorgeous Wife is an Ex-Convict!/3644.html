        <h1>Chapter 3642</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unbeknownst to Camelia, tears had already filled her face. Suddenly, she knelt down in front of William and said, "William, I'm sorry. It's all my fault. You can blame me, resent me, but please forgive your grandfather... his health can't withstand the shock."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William looked down at Camelia, who was kneeling before him, and said, "What right do you have to say this to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, it was as if he couldn't stay in this room any longer. He turned around and left in quick strides.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Camelia was crying uncontrollably. It was the consequence of the mistakes they made in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their only grandson refused to forgive them now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William walked quickly to the outside of the hospital. Just as he was about to reach his car parked on the side of the road, he suddenly squatted down and began to vomit violently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His stomach churned violently, as if he was disgusted by something and wanted to purge everything from his stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He vomited for an unknown amount of time, until his stomach was almost empty. Exhausted, William stood up and stumbled into the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body leaned heavily against the back of the seat, his gaze hollow as he looked out at the night through the car window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once upon a time, when his mother passed away, he thought his grandparents would come to pick him up. Deep down, he actually had a glimmer of hope because he had seen other kids being affectionately held or carried by their grandparents, or getting treats and toys from them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hoped that his own grandparents would also like him and that he could be close to them, just like the other kids.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, all he got was disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was told that his grandparents wouldn't come to take him away. Instead, he would be left all alone in a welfare institution, hoping that someone would be willing to adopt him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But who would adopt a child of a criminal? Especially one who had offended the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So his days in the welfare institution were naturally not great.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he would stay there until he grew up and could take care of himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he never expected to be adopted by the Reed family and move into their house.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, those two people who had once abandoned him have come back into his life, disrupting the peace he had found. They keep asking for his forgiveness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Forgiveness?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How can he forgive again?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ever since he was sent to the welfare home years ago, he had told himself that they were no longer his family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe... hehe..." A bitter laughter echoed in the train compartment, filled with a strong disgust!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...Jasper was getting ready to sleep when suddenly her phone rang. She looked at the caller ID and saw that it was William's call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was almost 11 pm now, and usually he knew that this was the time she would be sleeping, so he rarely called her at this hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pressed the answer button and heard William's voice on the other end, "Are you asleep?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not yet, what's wrong? Why are you calling so late? Is there something you need?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing really, just... happened to pass by your place, so I thought I'd give you a call and chat for a bit," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't really a coincidence that he passed by, but rather when he came to his senses, the car was already on the side of the Reed House.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps subconsciously, he wanted to be closer to her.</span></p></div>
