        <h1>Chapter 297</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted her to see only him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you really must know, you might as well wait with me. If my people have found Lina's whereabouts, they'll inform me immediately," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was certainly no problem for Grace, but... Wait? Where should she wait with him?! Grace blinked and five minutes later, she finally knew where to wait with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Jason's room!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not the first time that she had entered his room, but it was the first time that she entered through the front door of his room rather than through the door which connected their rooms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once inside, Jason immediately took off his coat and pulled out a cell phone. He set it aside on a coffee table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned when she saw the phone. It was the same old phone she had bought him at a special price of 1,500 dollars. Many average people might have better phones than this one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he keep the phone with him all the time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he did not, how did she get through to him immediately when she called?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she finished examining the phone, she saw him continuing to undress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face went red immediately. "Why... Why are you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm getting changed, of course." He raised an eyebrow at her. "You used to watch me change clothes, didn't you? Is that a problem now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She choked. Well, she had seen him change clothes in the rental house, but he was just getting changed out of clothes like sweaters or jackets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Normally, he would go into the bathroom to change his underclothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was now stripped down to a thin shirt. If he continued to strip... At this point, Grace subconsciously turned her back to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Out of sight, out of mind. After all, she was now in his room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she heard some ruffling noises. He was probably taking off his clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know how long it would take him to change. Just as Grace was thinking of this, suddenly a pair of arms wrapped around her body and hugged her from the back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She instantly fell into a wide embrace as the familiar smell enveloped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. All she could hear was Jason's elegant voice saying, "Won't you look at me, Sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's... There's nothing to see," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You used to say that I look good and always wanted to see more of me," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wanted to go back in time and bite her tongue off. Why would she say that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you done changing your clothes?" She digressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can't you see for yourself?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." She was speechless for a moment. His hands were on her shoulders, forcing her to turn around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she turned to face him, her hand unconsciously touched his chest. Grace got a shock.</p></div>
