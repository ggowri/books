        <h1>Chapter 1850</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts could not stop sobbing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts said to Grace, "Let Mrs. Watts cry all she wants. She has suppressed some emotions in her heart for too long."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, because Mrs. Watts was crying so sadly, Grace could not help but think that there was something strange about Mrs. Watts&rsquo;s behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a long time, Mrs. Watts slowly stopped crying and said to Grace, "Grace, I... I want to offer incense to your father-in-law, and I... I made some food. I want to put them out here for your father-in-law. I hope he&rsquo;ll like them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts took out several food containers from the bag she was carrying and opened them as she spoke. They were filled with home-cooked dishes that were local to Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could not help frowning. These dishes were common in Emerald City. She had never seen Mrs. Watts cook these dishes before when she was in L City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Did Mrs. Watts learn to cook Emerald City's local food to pay respects to her father-in-law?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts had now placed the candles and took out the incense sticks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts bent over to light the candles, but Mrs. Watts said, "I'll do it. I want to light the candles myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts handed Mrs. Watts the candles in his hand when he heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With tears in her eyes, Mrs. Watts lit the candles and then the incense. Holding the incense sticks as she stood in front of the grave, she muttered to the gravestone, "Rest... in peace, and if there&rsquo;s a next life, I hope you can be happy there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If there really was a next life, she would atone for all her sins and repay him with all her might!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Rest in peace? Do you really think he can rest in peace?" A voice suddenly came from behind them, making Mrs. Watts stiffen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'This voice is...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, you're here!" said Grace as she headed over to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I'm here," said Jason as he looked coldly at Mrs. Watts with her back facing him. Moments later, Jason looked down, took Grace's hand, and said, "Grace, remember what you said? You won't stand against me no matter what happens."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, why are you bringing that up all of a sudden?" Grace asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Because I have something important to do next," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, he looked at Mrs. Watts again. "What's the matter? Do you think you can wipe the slate clean by paying your respects like this one time? How can someone like you have the nerve to show up in front of him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts trembled, and Old Lawyer Watts's face turned pale. If Jason could say something like that, it meant... he knew everything. He knew that the person in front of him was his missing mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay... Jason..." Mrs. Watts mumbled as she turned around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's expression turned colder. "Who are you to call my name?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Pain flashed across Mrs. Watts's eyes. "I know how wrong I was. Jason, please... forgive me, I know it's my fault. It's my fault!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts fell to her knees with a thump as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts got worried as soon as she knelt. "You just left the hospital, and your leg hasn't recovered. Your wound will split open if you kneel!"</p></div>
