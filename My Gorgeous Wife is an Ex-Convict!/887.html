        <h1>Chapter 886</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason seemed intensely cold, but Hadwin was also unflinching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All the noise seemed to have cut off from them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence, who was standing behind Jason, felt a layer of cold sweat on his back. If Master Reed got into a fight with Hadwin, it would not end well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the Stephenson family was not based in Emerald City, both would lose if they really wanted to go against the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, Hadwin might look elegant and charming, but he was actually ruthless and cunning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, how would a b*stard become the Stephenson family's patriarch?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace, who was in Jason's arms, said to Lina, "Lina... Jay&rsquo;s here to pick me up... We'll watch again... next time..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright... We'll... We'll watch next time!" replied Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two drunk women helped ease the atmosphere. Jason quickly walked out of the bar, holding Grace in his arms with a cold face. Terrence immediately followed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Lina, Hadwin wanted to take her away, yet she was unwilling. "Why don't we watch together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What? She wants to continue watching? I'll be pissed off if I watch it with her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin wanted to give the girl's eyes a good washing. He wanted to wash away all those eye-pricking images!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin hoisted Lina onto his shoulder and carried her out of the bar before slamming her into the car's passenger seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I haven't watched enough. Why did you bring me out? Hadwin... You... You can't stop me from pursuing music..." Lina kept on mumbling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Good, she's not too drunk to recognize me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin glared at Lina, but his glaring did not affect her. Hadwin sighed and finally bent down. Like a caring mother, he helped her with the safety belt and fixed her clothes as well as hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was still holding the little vest that she had managed to grab.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was holding it like it was a treasure. If he tried to grab it by force, he would attract the attention of onlookers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin thought about it before returning to the driver's seat. He then started the car to leave. He planned to grab the vest from Lina and throw it away later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the rearview mirror, Hadwin watched as another black car drove in the opposite direction. It was Jason's car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could vaguely see Jason through the window as he sat in the back seat holding Grace in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why break up if he can't get over her?' Hadwin thought to himself, then his eyes fell on the heartless girl beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Anyway, Lina said she loves me, so... I'll never break up with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm the only man she can ever love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She can forget about liking other men!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence drove with a sense of dread, unable to figure out what his boss was thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the back seat, Jason looked at Grace who was leaning in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she drunk? She's probably drunk. If she isn't drunk, she wouldn't be lying so intimately in my arms. She would only be too eager to establish boundaries between us.'</p></div>
