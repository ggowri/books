        <h1>Chapter 177</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Jason has been backing Grace ever since then!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">-</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed Jason into a private room. Once Grace sat down, Jason asked the manager to bring in some appetizers first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Come on, eat a little to ease the hunger pangs first. The appetizers here taste quite nice.&rdquo; He took a piece of appetizer as he spoke and brought it in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the appetizer in front of her and hesitated for a moment before she received it and ate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason then personally placed the menu in front of Grace. He said, &ldquo;Sis, take a look and see if there is anything you want to try.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Never mind. You can order on my behalf. I don&rsquo;t have any particular requests.&rdquo; Even while she was eating such a delicately-made appetizer, it was as if her tongue had a layer of wax. She could not properly enjoy the taste of the food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason squinted his eyes and stared at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, the atmosphere abruptly became chilly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager who was still in the private room held his breath while his heart thumped rapidly. He was afraid that this master here would throw a temper right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, a smile surfaced on Jason&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Then I shall order for you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He proceeded to order a few dishes while the manager noted down every one of them before retreating from the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Outside, the manager finally heaved in relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would guess that Emerald City&rsquo;s emperor-like man would be so caring and gentle toward a woman? However, that woman seemed to not want to accept that care.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Manager, did Young Master Reed bring that woman here for a meal?&rdquo; One of the nosy waitresses approached the manager and asked curiously. &ldquo;What is their relationship?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager glared at the waitress. &ldquo;There are some things that you shouldn&rsquo;t ask about. Do you think Young Master Reed was joking when he forced that woman earlier to kneel and apologize? I think that woman won&rsquo;t have a peaceful life in Emerald City from now on!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The waitress immediately retracted her neck, but she still looked over at the direction of Jason&rsquo;s private room with curiosity in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same moment, Jason was happily smiling as he looked at Grace. &ldquo;Sis, you don&rsquo;t like these appetizers? I&rsquo;ll get them to change it, then.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No need,&rdquo; Grace said as she looked at this cheerful man. Once upon a time, she had loved to see that smile. She had found his smile to have the power to sweep away all her fatigue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at his smile now, she had a feeling of terror instead. &ldquo;Do you mean that I can go back once I finish this meal?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A flicker crossed his gaze. &ldquo;Are you in a hurry to go home?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I want to rest earlier.&rdquo; She created an excuse. The truth was, she did not want to look at him and interact with him anymore. For each second she had to be with him, it became more clear to her the difference between them both.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart would unknowingly miss the Jason she used to know. She knew that Jason was just an imaginary persona he had created and that Jason did not exist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she still would think of Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid of me,&rdquo; he stared at her as he said it. It was not a question, but a statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body stiffened as she pursed her lips tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why? Because I&rsquo;m Jason?&rdquo; His gaze seemed like they could penetrate her. &ldquo;Sis, do you still miss Jay?&rdquo;</p></div>
