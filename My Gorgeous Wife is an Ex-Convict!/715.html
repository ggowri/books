        <h1>Chapter 714</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian stood in front of her, Grace was in a light trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you looking at me like that?" His cold voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" She suddenly came back to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s as if you were looking for something in me." He leaned forward suddenly, his face zooming in before her eyes. "I thought you're only interested in Jason. Why, is there anything in me you&rsquo;re interested in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stepped back subconsciously, trying to avoid him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the heels she was wearing today were already high. The heels tilted as she stepped back, and the dress had now become a hindrance, causing her to fall backward without any time to react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only thing she could do was instinctively reach out and grab for something!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand grasped another hand as if she was someone who was about to fall from a cliff and had at last grasped a chance of survival. She gripped it tightly with her five fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, an arm encircled her waist and stopped her from falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you all right?" She heard Brian's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stood up in shock. Breathless, she stared blankly at the hand she was holding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was holding Brian's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was holding it so tightly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was how the little girl had held the little boy's hand so tightly in her dreams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her head... Hurt again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if a needle was stabbing at her head, and the broken images kept appearing in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The dress is torn. I like this dress very much. It's expensive, so Grandma told me to cherish it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about I get you a lot of dresses in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want that many. I like this one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about I get you a purple dress someday? I like purple best."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does the purple dress have as many little flowers as this one? I like these little flowers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, then I'll get you a purple dress with lots of little flowers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A conversation between two young voices kept ringing in her ear. These voices belonged to... The little girl and the little boy in her dreams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, what's come over you?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Whose... Whose voice is that? Who&rsquo;s speaking in my ear?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her headache got worse and worse, and the sharp pain seemed to make her head burst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It hurts..." The sound of her moans escaped from her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it a headache? What the hell is happening to you?" asked Brian. The woman in front of him was pale with beads of sweat pouring out of her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand clutched her temple, and she looked as if she was suffering from intense pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her like this, his heart could not help but tighten. A feeling called distress continued to spread throughout his body with its roots in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm taking you to the hospital right now," Brian said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, one of her hands was still holding on to his tightly, and her fingers almost looked as if they were pressing into his bones.</p></div>
