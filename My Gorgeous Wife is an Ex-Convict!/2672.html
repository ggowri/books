        <h1>Chapter 2670</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just because Barbara Schuman disliked her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was only lucky to keep her hands because campus security spotted them and came to her rescue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, she found out why Barbara Schuman targeted her that way. It was because her comic got published, and some classmates jokingly called her a comic artist. Barbara Schuman had also participated in a comic contest in high school but failed to win it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Barbara Schuman's opinion, it was already a sin that her comic was published!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze as every joint of her body seemingly stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman smiled wider as she picked up a box of mooncakes and walked up to Valda Theller. "By the way, try some of these mooncakes. I'll give you more if you like them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman said as she pretended to shove the mooncakes into Valda Theller's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller raised her hand to push the mooncake box in front of her, but it fell to the floor before she could do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman looked upset. "Valda, you don't have to throw it on the floor like this even if you don't like the mooncakes and think they're cheap."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were so close that no one could see how the box of mooncakes fell to the floor. They only thought Valda Theller threw it based on Barbara Schuman's statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way the surrounding crowd looked at Valda Theller changed instantly. Someone even taunted, "Oh, she already thinks she's superior before she's even popular. We regular folks find these mooncakes amazing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will she have her nose in the air when she gets popular?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't the netizens say she used to be a bully at school? Is she trying to intimidate Miss Li?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who does she think she is? Intimidate Miss Li? Who does she think Miss Li is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller heard the whispers around her, which gradually brought her back to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller crouched down, picked up the box of mooncakes, and handed it back to Barbara Schuman. "I think you misunderstood me. This box of mooncakes isn't cheap to me. I'm not rich. How could I find a box of mooncakes worth hundreds of dollars cheap? You know I'm an orphan. Mooncakes symbolize reunion. But I stopped eating mooncakes since my parents died to prevent myself from being reminded of it. Regardless, thank you for the mooncakes. It's better to give them to someone who can reunite with their family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was no longer the pathetic pushover that she used to be. She would fight back if Barbara Schuman were up to no good against her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile on Barbara Schuman's face froze. Then, she smiled as she took the mooncakes. "I'm so sorry. I'll give them to someone else, then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she looked past Valda Theller at the person coming over. "Raymond Bowman, why don't I give you this box of mooncakes since Valda doesn't eat them? Speaking of which, we haven't seen each other in ages."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Something complicated flickered in Raymond Bowman's eyes. "Yeah, it's been ages."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Valda Theller was the one he wanted to see the most, Barbara Schuman was the last person he wanted to see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought he loved this woman and had even done everything that he thought was despicable for her, only to realize that he loved nothing but his pride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he wanted was to conquer Barbara Schuman and prove that he could get any woman he wanted.</p></div>
