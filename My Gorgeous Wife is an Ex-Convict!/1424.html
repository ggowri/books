        <h1>Chapter 1423</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As she was thinking about it, the door of the president's office in front of her opened. Harold Atkinson walked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Harold Atkinson was standing sideways facing the office, so he did not notice that Grace was standing not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jason, if you really want to get justice for Grace, don't forget that you had a hand in what happened to her too!" Harold Atkinson said fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's heart gave a sudden jolt. She subconsciously took a few steps forward. Then, the familiar cold voice came through the half-opened door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Harold Atkinson, if you dare say one more word, I'll make sure the Atkinson family ceases to exist!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her eyes caught sight of the figure standing inside. However, the handsome face she was familiar with was now full of cold rage. Killing intent flashed across his beautiful peach blossom eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Killing intent... Am I seeing it wrongly?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Harold Atkinson, who was standing by the door, was frightened by Jason. He subconsciously turned his head to avoid his gaze but was stunned to see Grace standing on the other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, Harold Atkinson's expression changed. He glared at Grace with hatred before hurrying off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason spotted Grace as well. He instantly stiffened, and his rage quickly faded away. It was replaced by his usual gentle expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, there was a panic in his eyes that he could not suppress no matter what. His hands and feet turned cold in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Did she hear... what Harold Atkinson said?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Then... what will she think? Will she...' Jason only felt that even breathing had become a little difficult at the thought of a certain possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace entered the office with a frown on her face. "Jay, you and Harold Atkinson&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's just something about work..." he replied quickly, trying to look normal. However, his heart was beating so hard that he spoke with a slight gasp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You don't look very well. What's the matter?" She raised her hand and tried to touch his pale cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He suddenly reached out and grasped her hand. "I... Nothing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, his grasp made her exclaim, "Your hands are freezing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She pulled his hands over, held them in her palms, and habitually began to rub them for him. "Why are your hands so cold?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although the weather was colder now, they still had a heater indoors, so the temperature was appropriate. His hands should not be cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked down at Grace who was rubbing his hands. His hands were getting warmer bit by bit, but his heart seemed to be sinking...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, do you feel warmer now? If you still feel cold, you can turn up the heater..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before Grace could finish, Jason raised his other hand and suddenly grabbed her shoulder to pull her into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was shocked and heard his voice. "I won't feel cold... as long as you&rsquo;re by my side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her face was pressed against his chest, and she could almost hear his heartbeat thumping quickly. Besides, he was trembling a little now.</p></div>
