        <h1>Chapter 113</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking of this, Sean couldn't help but shiver. He looked at Lily next to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, the Stevens family and the Atkinson family were in the same boat. "Even if Jason was really interested in Grace, he wouldn't... take action against both families for a woman, right?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, Grace ending up in that state back then was all her own fault, right?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace felt that she had been having a very long dream.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In her dream, she felt like she had returned to prison. No matter how hard she tried to escape or plead for mercy, she could not escape the torture.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Bone-chillingly cold, filthy water, punches and kicks rained down on her as the people said with mocking tones, "Look, she was a great lawyer, an intellectual. But now, she is just like us. Actually, she's not even better than me right now. She can't even fight back!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">How long was she supposed to endure all this suffering? Why... Why did she have to suffer such pain when she hadn't done anything wrong?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, do you know what was your biggest mistake? Offending the lord of Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, anyone who offends Jason will not have a good ending."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, Mr. Reed is merciful. That's why he didn't kill you. Otherwise, you would have died in prison!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Merciful? She had been imprisoned for three years. She was wounded all over. She might not ever be able to have a child in her life. Could this be called being merciful?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt so much pain that it was as if her body was about to explode.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Who would save her from all this suffering?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't... don't..." She struggled desperately, but she didn't know what she was struggling for. Was it because she wanted to break free from the pain in her body, or was it because she wanted to break away from such a tragic fate?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Who could help her? Who could protect her?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, it's okay. I'm here. I'm right here. No one can hurt you." A familiar voice sounded by her ear.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Whose voice is this?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh, right, it's Jay! Jay!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace opened her eyes with some difficulty. What entered her view was a face that was as handsome as a deity's.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was... Jay! But... it seemed that there was something different about him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, you're finally awake. Are you still feeling unwell?" Jason's cold voice contained a hint of tenderness.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace shook her head. After she had sat up with his help, she realized that there was something different about him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His thick bangs were now combed back, revealing his full forehead. He was wearing a tailor-made suit with a tie around his neck and had a watch on his wrist. Grace recognized the watch's brand. If this watch was authentic, then it would have to be worth at least a few million dollars.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is this... Jay?" She blinked her eyes and felt that everything was a bit surreal.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, what's wrong?" he asked again because she looked to be in a trance.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are... are you really Jay?" she asked in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, I am," he replied.</p></div>
