        <h1>Chapter 4150 His Insecurity</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She added, "Of course, I used to think highly of your character, but now I realize that I was clearly mistaken!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her palm still tingled, reminding her of the slap she had just delivered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit raised his hand and touched the place where he had been slapped. The sensation of pain and Tina's gaze at that moment filled his chest with complex emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Furthermore, the resources I gave you weren't something I could casually obtain with just a few words! I had to beg my mother and promised that it would be a one-time thing for you. I believe that as long as you are given an opportunity, you can seize it with your own efforts and talent. That's why my mother agreed to talk to my father and why you have this opportunity!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a pause, Tina continued, "I said I'm your fan, so I want my idol to have a broader stage, to shine on a stage that belongs to him. But now I'm starting to doubt if I was wrong, if I shouldn't have liked an idol like you in the first place."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He fell into silence, feeling an even sharper pain in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you are more willing to exchange your body for resources, then you can refuse this opportunity, because from the beginning, I never intended to gain any benefits from you, let alone have you use your body in exchange! And the resources I can offer you, this is the only chance. If you have nothing else to say, then I'll leave!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing her words, Tina didn't look at Kit again and left directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit stood there dumbfounded, the pain on his face reminding him of what he had just experienced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he found out that Tina was the one who had provided him with the resources, his anger and insecurity merged into an indescribable emotion. In that instant, he felt like a beggar, accepting Tina's charity!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's why he came to see her and deliberately said those things, just to vent this feeling of inferiority in his heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But... she turned out to be more honest than he had imagined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And her honesty only highlighted his own filthiness!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After Kit's manager made several phone calls to reach Kit, he finally got through, but before he could ask where Kit was, Kit spoke first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Where are the leftover gifts from the charity event that the fans gave me? Where are they?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Huh?" The manager paused for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I mean the charity event I organized after I got injured and hospitalized!" Kit reminded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I think they are kept in the company warehouse." The manager replied uncertainly. After all, it had been over two years since then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I want to go to the warehouse, go get the keys." Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What? Now?" The manager asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, now. I'll be waiting for you at the entrance of the company warehouse!" Kit ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The manager stared at his phone for a while before putting it away and rushing to the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> What's going on! Finally, we landed a big opportunity out of the blue, and now Kit suddenly leaves, and wants to go to the warehouse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When the manager arrived at the warehouse, Kit was already there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, as soon as the manager saw the obvious palm print on Kit's face, he froze. "Your face..."</p></div>
