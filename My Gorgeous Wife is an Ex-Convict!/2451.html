        <h1>Chapter 2449</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George, it's not what you think. Didn't you read Sis' mental illness report back then? Besides, you also said it would be better for her to stay in the hospital for long-term treatment," Louise Mitchell said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I did say that at the time," muttered George Gregory as he stared blankly at his wife with dark emotionless eyes. "Tell me, was Amber Mitchell really mentally ill?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's heart thumped and almost burst out of her throat. The next moment, she replied in a calm voice, "Of course. How could it be fake?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" His lashes quivered slightly. He closed his eyes and rested his head on the seat of the car. "Get out of the car!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Louise Mitchell froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said, get out of the car now. I want some peace." The car stopped as he finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's eyes widened in disbelief. "You... You want me to get out of the car? But there's a lot of media following us. They'll write about me again if I get out of the car now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said... Get out of the car!" George Gregory slowly opened his eyes, but he was looking indifferently at Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell shuddered, and her blood seemed to freeze at his gaze. She opened the car door and got out of the car numbly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the car sped away, leaving her alone in the cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell had no choice but to stop the Mitchell family's car that was following from behind and get into it. She knew those gossipy reporters must have taken photos of that scene earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell would be in the headline of gossip news and become the joke of Deer City tomorrow!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell did not return to the Gregory family&rsquo;s house but went to the Mitchell family&rsquo;s house first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The look in George Gregory's eyes when he made her get out of the car just now made her afraid to face the man she loved deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the Mitchell family&rsquo;s house, Mr. Mitchell and Mrs. Mitchell had already dismissed the servants. When their daughter told her what had happened today, Mrs. Mitchell could not help cursing, "That little b*tch! I didn't expect her to be able to turn her fate around and find someone to help her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, the people helping her aren't simple. As far as I know, there are Jason from the Reed family of Emerald City and Brian, the crown prince of the entertainment industry. Besides that, the man standing next to the pregnant lady who claims to be Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s friend is no average Joe either," said Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Mitchell seemed increasingly uneasy. "What... What should we do, then? Are we really going to admit that we put a normal person in a mental hospital? If those doctors say anything about our deal..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Mitchell said solemnly, "They won&rsquo;t unless they're looking for trouble. Their lives will be ruined if they expose it. Once they admit to such a thing, they'll have to go to prison! Anyway, we have to distance ourselves from this. Just say that Amber Mitchell became mentally unstable after Herman Moss's death in the car accident. The doctors back then had diagnosed her to be mentally ill. We don't know how she was suddenly diagnosed as normal now. Those people should ask the doctors who diagnosed her back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In conclusion, Mr. Mitchell wanted the Mitchell family to stay out of it.</p></div>
