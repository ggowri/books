        <h1>Chapter 337</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," Grace said as she took the book.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm the one who should thank you," said Kyla Corbyn. "Nelson has had little communication with outsiders. Besides, he can&rsquo;t hear or speak, so others are less willing to communicate with him. I'm really happy that you&rsquo;re willing to learn sign language to talk to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson is lovable, and he seems to like me too. I guess it's just fate," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fate... Kyla Corbyn's lips moved, but at last, she only said, "Yes, perhaps... this is fate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I got to go now, Kyla," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, see you tomorrow." Kyla Corbyn waited until Grace left before closing the restaurant's door and going into the small room at the back of the restaurant. She looked at her son who was already asleep on his bed. Mrs. Corbyn was gently patting him on the body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is he asleep?" Kyla Corbyn asked softly, subconsciously lowering her voice even though she knew her son could not hear her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, he just fell asleep," said Mrs. Corbyn. "Is Grace going to learn sign language?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It must be true. She even thanked me when I gave her the sign language book," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Unexpectedly, she's quite a nice person. I can see she's kind to Nelson these days." Mrs. Corbyn sighed. She had changed her opinion of Grace during this period.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think there's something more to her imprisonment," Kyla Corbyn said as she sat down. "She seems cautious. I heard her talking to her friend on the phone before and they seemed to be talking about reversing her case. Maybe she was wronged and that's why she wants it reversed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She seems to have suffered as much as you had." Mrs. Corbyn's expression suddenly turned sinister. "If you hadn't been wronged, you wouldn't have been put in prison, or even..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Say no more, Mom," Kyla Corbyn said as she shook her head. "No matter what, I'm content that I can be with you and Nelson now. Once we get enough money for Nelson's cochlear implant, everything will get better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you really not going to find him?" Mrs. Corbyn hesitated before asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, I know you think that if I go to see him, maybe he&rsquo;ll remember that Nelson is his child and will make life easier for me and Nelson. However, don't you know that it was he who put me in jail when I was pregnant? Do you think he cares if Nelson is his child?" Kyla Corbyn said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been so miserable and so hopeless that now all that remained was calmness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn wiped her eyes sadly at this. "I'm just afraid that you'll be too tired and won't be able to handle all of this yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. I have you and Nelson. No matter what happens in the future, you can rest assured that I can handle it." Kyla Corbyn's gentle and beautiful face raised a smile. "All right, you should go to bed early. Let me clean up a little and prepare the ingredients for tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn nodded and lied down beside Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn turned around, but her smile had disappeared from her face. Her mother thought she might have a better life if she went back to that man, but what she feared now was that the man's revenge might never stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she was released from prison, she left the city with her mother and Nelson. They left their hometown and came to Emerald City to avoid the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only by avoiding this man would her life truly start over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just wanted to&hellip; never see that man again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the old man who was half-seated in bed. She never expected that Jason's grandfather, the man who once ruled Emerald City, would send someone to intercept her and take her to the hospital.</p></div>
