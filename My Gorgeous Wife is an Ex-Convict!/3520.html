        <h1>Chapter 3518</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why would I abandon you? Don't talk nonsense!" She said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And at this moment, thinking back to those conversations, it turns out...he had already hinted at her from the beginning!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at that time, she didn't think about it in any other way, thinking that those words were just him being clingy and saying things casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Will you feel disgusted?" Jason's voice suddenly sounded in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Disgusted? If it were before, she would have instinctively disliked this kind of behavior. Her whereabouts were known by someone else without her knowledge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at this moment, she suddenly understood why Mason would do such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was... afraid that one day she would disappear, afraid that one day she would abandon him. That's why he put such a tracking device in the pendant of the necklace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the subsequent facts also proved that if it weren't for the tracking device in the necklace, she might have encountered more unbearable things, and he would not have been able to come to her as soon as possible, know her whereabouts, and save her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not disgusted." Veronica sniffled and her nose felt extremely sour at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason looked at the girl in front of him with some surprise. Her reaction was much better than he had originally imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then, Uncle Reed, can you contact Mason? I have a lot to say to him!" Veronica said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure." Jason smiled slightly and took out his phone, dialing a number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica almost held her breath and waited anxiously. Finally, when the phone was answered and she heard Mason's voice, tears streamed down her face as if her eyes could no longer contain them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, it's me!" Veronica urgently took the phone from Jason's hand and spoke to Mason on the other end, "I tried calling you, but couldn't get through. Mason, I'm sorry for misunderstanding you. Can you come back to the country soon? I have a lot to say to you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so? So you finally realized it was a misunderstanding," Mason's voice calmly came through, sounding distant, "But...even if it was a misunderstanding, what does it matter? Veronica, to you, I will always just be your 'little brother'."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A little brother who could be discarded at any time, not someone truly important in her life, someone she couldn't bear to lose!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This misunderstanding only made him see the reality more clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." She choked up, wanting to say something else, but her throat felt like it was being blocked and she couldn't speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew what kind of answer Mason wanted, but could she give it to him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he said, to her, he was just a younger brother, and she only saw him as a younger brother, never considering anything else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her view, his change in feelings towards her was only because she had dated Daniel before, so he was like a child who had his toy taken away and wanted to take it back and occupy that position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she simply couldn't put him in that role.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Mason's indifferent voice continued to come from her phone, "So, don't contact me again in the future. I don't want to hear anything from you, Veronica. From now on, you are not the Veronica I know."</p></div>
