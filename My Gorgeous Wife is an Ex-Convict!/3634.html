        <h1>Chapter 3632</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what?" a cold voice said, "I've been on a plane for a long time and I'm tired. I'm going back to my room."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Mason, don't you greet your parents?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not too late to greet them after waking up," Mason said, then went upstairs and walked towards his own room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper and Mick were used to Mason's indifference.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps outsiders see Mason as cold, but they know very well that he is the kind of person who doesn't speak much but can surely take down anyone who harms his family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper muttered, "Big brother, do you think Mason really has no feelings for Veronica anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have no idea," Mick shrugged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But can feelings really be forgotten so easily? Can someone go from deep emotions to no emotions just by hypnosis?" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who knows, but it seems that not everyone can do this kind of hypnosis. Mason had to put in some effort to find that doctor," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard Trista say that Uncle Weiss also underwent this kind of hypnosis, but later, the hypnosis was broken, and Uncle Weiss regained all his feelings for Auntie Kyla," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person she referred to as Uncle Weiss and Auntie Kyla is Martin and Kyla, and Trista is their youngest daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Big brother, do you think Mason will ever regain his feelings for Veronica?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should ask Mason about that!" Mick replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did ask Mason, but he didn't say anything," Jasper frowned. She was afraid that he would just ignore her like he did before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It actually depends on whether he wants to or not," a voice suddenly interrupted their conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked up and saw William coming down the stairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, what do you mean? What do you mean by whether he wants to or not?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In cases like this, there is usually a passphrase to undo the hypnosis, and Mason should know it. If he truly wants to restore his feelings, he can use the passphrase to break the hypnosis. But if he doesn't want to, even if the feelings return accidentally, he can choose to be hypnotized again," William explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper blinked, deeply impressed by her boyfriend's words. She had never thought about it from that perspective.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that's the case, it really just comes down to whether Mason wants to or not.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, how did you guys start talking about Mason?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason is back," Jasper said. "But he's already gone to rest in his room. If you want to see him, you'll have to come back tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll come back tomorrow then. It's getting late, I should head home now," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll walk you out!" Jasper quickly got up from the couch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them walked out of the Reed family's living room and headed towards the parking area.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, if we were to have a fight in the future, what would you do? Would you do what Mason did to me?" Jasper suddenly asked on the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William raised an eyebrow slightly. "Are you referring to using hypnosis to forget our feelings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" he answered firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because, to me, no matter what happens between us in the future, these little moments and feelings we've shared are very important to me. I don't want to forget them. Even if there may be regrets and pain, I don't want to forget." If he were to truly forget these feelings, he wouldn't even know what he would have left.</span></p></div>
