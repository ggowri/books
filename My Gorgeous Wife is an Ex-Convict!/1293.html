        <h1>Chapter 1292</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He unknowingly fell into a trance as he looked at the large and small figures walking hand in hand. He did not immediately drive away. Instead, he slowly closed his eyes and leaned heavily against the back of the seat even after the two figures disappeared from his sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's going on with me?' He felt his heart turn warm at the sight of Kyla Corbyn and Nelson together. Did he think Kyla Corbyn was a good mother? He even hesitated a little when he thought about whether to fight for Nelson&rsquo;s custody.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Kyla Corbyn was a good mother to Nelson, his son must not be raised by someone with the last name Carbyn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all because Kyla Corbyn had such a father! Why did her father drive the Weiss family into a corner and almost destroyed them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After an unknown amount of time, Martin Weiss saw Kyla Corbyn riding her motorcycle that was attached to her stall out of the neighborhood. The thin figure riding the simple electric motorcycle looked as if the wind could blow her off it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the electric bicycle stopped. Kyla Corbyn lowered her head and covered the upper part of her right abdomen. Her body also seemed to be trembling slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned, opened the car door, and quickly walked to the bicycle. It was only then that he saw that Kyla Corbyn's face was full of pain, and she was biting her lower lip as if she was desperately suppressing the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened to you? Where does it hurt?" asked Martin Weiss. There was anxiety in his tone that he had not noticed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm... alright..." Kyla Corbyn said with difficulty. She did not expect the pain to come twice today, and it seemed to be more painful than the previous one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's thin lips were pressed into a straight line. The way she looked did not look like she was all right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take you to the hospital first!" he said and set out to lift her from the bicycle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said defiantly, "No! You... You needn't worry about me... Mr. Weiss. Besides, I have no... extra money to go to the doctor..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss almost said he would pay for the treatment, but he suddenly stopped when the words were about to escape his mouth! 'What am I doing? Am I going to pay for her to see a doctor?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more miserable she was, the happier he ought to be! Her father almost destroyed the Weiss family, and since her father died early, she would have to suffer on behalf of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't flatter yourself. How could I possibly bother with you? It's your business whether you live or die. The custody case hasn't started yet, so don't try anything funny!" Martin Weiss said coldly. He was telling her that but also to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was telling himself not to bother with the woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Kyla Corbyn was still in pain, she could not help laughing. Sure enough, in the man's opinion, it was a sin for her to live!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, the pain eased a little. She drew a heavy breath and looked at Martin Weiss as she said, "Mr. Weiss, don't worry. Even if I die one day, I won't die in front of you and become an eyesore. I only hope you'll separate the trial from this, but... don't hurt Nelson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Kyla Corbyn restarted the electric bicycle and drove past Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stared at the departing electric bicycle and the figure on it with a livid face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a throbbing pain in his heart just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she said the word &lsquo;die&rsquo;, he seemed to have been severely whipped by an invisible whip!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">... </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While having dinner that evening, the chopsticks in Grace's hand suddenly dropped to the ground and her expression changed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you feel unwell?" Jason immediately panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, there's just... a sudden pain in my knuckles. It's nothing serious,&rdquo; Grace said and asked the maid to give her another pair of clean chopsticks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, it was getting colder now. It had been rainy and humid for two days, so her knuckles were probably very sensitive to the change in temperature.</p></div>
