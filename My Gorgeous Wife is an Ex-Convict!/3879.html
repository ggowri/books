        <h1>Chapter 3877</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Veronica was a little speechless. Was she too early to come here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aren't you having morning sickness? The food here is said to be very good on the internet, with both taste and nutrition taken into account. And some pregnant women who are prone to morning sickness especially like the food here," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Internet reviews? When did you start paying attention to this kind of restaurant?" Veronica couldn't help but ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When you went to the bathroom after seeing the doctor," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was only a few minutes, and in that short time, he found this restaurant online and even read the reviews? That was too fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing her doubts, he said, "This restaurant was recommended to me by your friend, she probably found out about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You mean Shirley?" Veronica asked. After all, among her friends who knew she was pregnant, only Shirley would recommend this kind of restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm." Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A warm feeling rose in Veronica's heart. It was really nice to have a friend like Shirley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They entered the restaurant and Mason ordered a private room. After they sat down, Veronica had a hard time choosing from the wide variety of dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes having too many choices isn't necessarily a good thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Also, she was experiencing morning sickness and wasn't sure which foods would make her feel nauseous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can't decide?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...they all look appetizing to me," Veronica said. "And I'm not sure which foods will make me feel sick."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let's order everything," Mason said directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was startled, even the waiter next to them was stunned. "Everything...on the menu?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, order everything that can be ordered," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But...the price..." The waiter thought Mason was showing off or causing trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll pay first. You can order all the dishes on the menu," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now the waiter had nothing to say. Since Mason had already paid, even if they ordered everything, it was their own business!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica hesitated and asked, "Do you really want to order everything?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, it's hard to tell which ones you like. If you like the taste, then during your pregnancy, we can have the restaurant's chef take care of your meals," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Veronica didn't know what to say. This young master was so open about even wanting to poach people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, dishes started coming out one after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Knowing that they had ordered quite a lot, Veronica only tasted each dish and if she liked it, she would take a few more bites and make a note of which dish it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even so, by the time all the dishes were served, she was almost full.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, none of the dishes made her nauseous. She wasn't sure if it was because they tasted good or because she had already thrown up earlier that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How's the food here?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's pretty good," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let the restaurant prepare your three meals a day?" Mason suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, no need!" Veronica quickly declined. She didn't expect him to be serious about it. "If I want to eat, I'll just come here and eat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's fine too. Or we can see if there are other chefs who can make dishes that you like," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, in the following days, Veronica's meals were delivered by someone from the restaurant, and they were all dishes from that same restaurant.</p></div>
