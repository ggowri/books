        <h1>Chapter 2698</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked blankly at him. He had just saved her again. "It doesn't hurt," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone nearby said, "Brian, are you saving the damsel in distress to show your affection in public?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The place is covered with carpet. It won't hurt much even if you fall."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone joked to Valda Theller, "You must be somebody to have Brian save you like that. After all, Brian would just look on calmly and do nothing even if someone was trying to jump off the building!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian helped Valda Theller sit down and glanced at the carpet under them out of the corner of his eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Indeed, with the thickness of the carpet, Valda Theller would not have felt much pain even if she did fall to the floor. However, he acted without thinking much when he saw her falling backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Was I... scared that Valda Theller would get hurt?' Brian's eyes flash with thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, the game officially began. There were rounds and rounds of drawing. Some people chose truth, while some chose dare. Besides the usual punishment tasks like drinking alcohol and doing push-ups, it also included mimicking celebrities. Someone was even punished to kiss the person next to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Valda Theller saw two men kissing. Valda Theller gaped and turned to look at Brian, "Are you guys that wild?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You mean the kiss?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She nodded her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Think about it the other way. A kiss is only two people's skin touching. It's just like a handshake. Kissing is only kissing when it's with someone you love," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller dared not ask Brian if he would kiss someone so easily when playing such a game with his friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Another round began. They drew Brian this time, and the one asking the question was... Phoebe Cross.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll choose truth," Brian said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross was upset. She would rather he chose dare so that she could ask him to hold her or even do something more intimate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'd like to ask if you really love Valda Theller." Phoebe Cross asked as her eyes became fixed on Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, everyone focused on Brian. Valda Theller, who was sitting beside Brian, could not help stiffening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How... is Brian going to answer this question?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Brian's thin lips gently uttered the simple word. That handsome face seemed to be covered with the perfect mask, and no one knew whether he was telling the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if in disbelief, Phoebe Cross blurted out, "Kiss her if you love her. Kiss her in front of us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian gazed at Phoebe Cross coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone nearby also said, "Phoebe, what are you doing? Brian has answered your question. He didn't choose dare."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Phoebe Cross ignored them. She just stared at Brian and asked, "Will you do it? Will you prove it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The atmosphere instantly became depressive. Valda Theller could not help feeling nervous again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I love her. Why wouldn't I prove it?" replied Brian before turning sideways. His phoenix eyes looked at Valda Theller beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller bit her lip nervously. Watching Brian's face getting closer and closer, her heart beat faster and faster as if it would jump out of her throat at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Should I refuse him? Or let him... kiss me?'</p></div>
