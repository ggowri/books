        <h1>Chapter 3267</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence learned to play the piano by following Jasper, which led to the Abbott family receiving care from the Reed family. The Abbott couple got new jobs with higher income than before, and the Reed family took care of all Lawrence's tuition fees.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Abbott family is now considered wealthy in the eyes of ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona may have had a difficult past where she was constantly looked down upon and oppressed for a long time. As a result, now that her situation has turned around, she wants everyone to know that she is living a good life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She changed her attire from before and when she usually goes to pick up her children from school, she always boasts about her son and the Reed family's little princess being friends. Her son's piano skills have also been appreciated by the Reed family's little princess. She even mentions that her son will become a great pianist in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first, people naturally didn't believe Wilona's words, and some even mocked her. However, one time she showed a video of her son and Jasper playing the piano together at the Reed family's house, and finally, others believed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, people's perception of Lawrence naturally changed as they looked at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There is envy, there is jealousy, and there is mockery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence is still the same at school, not like his mother who likes to show off in a flashy way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Wilona always likes to buy branded new clothes for her son and makes him wear that expensive children's watch to school every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, Lawrence doesn't like wearing this watch because every time he wears it, it reminds him of the gap between himself and Mr. Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But his mother likes him to wear this watch and always likes to show off how much it costs to others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After school, Lawrence was surrounded by a group of older boys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He immediately became nervous. He knew these people - they were the school bullies. Many people were afraid to mess with them. He had also heard from classmates that they had extorted pocket money from them before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He instinctively wanted to leave, but he couldn't because the boys had blocked him off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you want from me?" he asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Give us the watch on your wrist!" one of the boys demanded, clearly used to taking things from others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence shook his head and nervously protected his wristwatch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he didn't like the watch, he knew it was expensive and a gift from Mr. Barlow. If it was taken away, not only would his parents be angry, but Jasper would also be upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because Jasper and Mr. Barlow were close, anything given by Mr. Barlow couldn't be lost!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you give it or not?" the leader of the boys asked impatiently. When Lawrence shook his head, they moved closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I can't give it to you! I can't!" Lawrence said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The leader of the boys snatched the watch, and the others joined in to help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boys were all older and stronger than Lawrence, and he couldn't protect the watch. In no time, they had taken it and left him with several injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Lawrence walked out of school, Wilona was shocked to see her son looking visibly beaten up. She asked, "What happened? How did this happen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mummy, my watch... my watch was stolen," Lawrence murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What? Your watch was stolen?" Wilona immediately grabbed her son's left hand and sure enough, the watch on his wrist was gone. "How could you let someone steal your watch? Do you know how much that watch cost?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona immediately scolded her son. She was about to take him to school to talk to the teacher when suddenly she stopped in her tracks. It seemed like she had just remembered something. She turned around and took her son with her on her electric scooter.</p></div>
