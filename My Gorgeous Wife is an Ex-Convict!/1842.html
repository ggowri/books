        <h1>Chapter 1840</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wanted to see her son and her two other biological grandchildren whom she had never met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her heart was filled with unspeakable bitterness from the moment she stepped into the Reed family&rsquo;s house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had once tried every means possible to join the Reed family but could only sneak into Reed Residence without Old master Reed's knowledge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She used Kim's feelings as a bargaining chip to enter Reed Residence. However, she underestimated the old master's cruelty, which eventually killed Kim and hurt her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He'll forgive you. If he loved you that much, he'd hate for you to be so miserable," said Old Lawyer Watts as he gently hugged his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had her right hamstring cut, and she was disfigured when he first met her, but he was strangely attracted to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They had been married for 20 years now. On the day he married her, she told him all about her past, but he still insisted on marrying her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew she felt indebted to two people&mdash;her ex-husband and her son. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she never revealed who her husband and son were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She only told him that her husband was Kim and her son was Jason when they came to Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Once we cure your leg, we'll go home. No matter how upset or remorseful you are, don't give yourself away in front of Jason. I want you to be safe, got it?" said Old Lawyer Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts looked at her husband of 20 years with tears in her eyes. "Milo, I'm sorry to make you worry so much about me. If Jason resents and hates me, I'm willing to take it. I won't involve you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We're married. You're making me a stranger by saying such things. They won't know if we don't tell them. Jason didn't recognize you when he met you, did he? Once you undergo the operation on your leg, we&rsquo;ll return to L City and never set foot in Emerald City again," said Old Lawyer Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The secret would forever remain a secret!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace told Jason about what had happened in the mourning hall at night. "Would you be upset if I let my mentor and his wife offer incense to your father and Old master Reed in the mourning hall?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason asked, "They're your mentor and your mentor's wife. Why would I be upset? But why did you take them there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I was taking them for a walk around the main house to help with digestion but we happened to walk past the mourning hall. Mrs. Watts said she would like to go in to see Dad and offer incense to him," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason frowned slightly, "Was it Mrs. Watts who offered to do so?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, Mrs. Watts's eyes were red when she offered the incense. She said she wasn&rsquo;t feeling well, so I arranged a driver to take them back to the hotel," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Your mentor's wife is so sensitive that she started tearing up when offering incense,&rdquo; Jason said thoughtfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said with a sigh, "It&rsquo;s probably because Dad died young. Speaking of which, Mrs. Watts has had a hard life too. Today, I learned that the reason she can't walk normally is that she had her hamstring cut before. It&rsquo;s not just because of the joint injury that was caused in the accident she was involved in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason instantly stiffened. "She had her hamstring... cut before."</p></div>
