        <h1>Chapter 2206</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was suddenly a little upset. "Kyla, you don't have to pretend in front of me. We both know each other's past. You got pregnant at such an age. Didn't you do it to tie the father down? I'm just telling you that only sons can tie them down. It's pointless to give birth to daughters!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As far as I'm concerned, both boys and girls are the same. I got pregnant because I like children, not because I want to tie someone down!" replied Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come on, you can only fool others with that kind of talk," replied Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stopped explaining. After all, some people would insist on believing their preconceived notions. It was pointless to say anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, it&rsquo;s rare that we run into each other. Why don't you give me your phone number? We can meet up for tea or something when we're free!" With that said, Jacqueline Bowman took out her phone and asked, "What's your phone number?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated slightly before giving her phone number. Though they had different worldviews now, Jacqueline Bowman had indeed helped her in prison. It would be rude not to give her her phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After exchanging phone numbers, Kyla left, while Jacqueline Bowman went to the dispensary to get her medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was traditional medicine to nourish her health. The doctor said it was because she had undergone too many abortions. Therefore, it was difficult for her to get pregnant again now that she wanted to. She was 32 years old now. She would have a miserable future if she could not bear a son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was released from prison, a businessman who had always pursued her kept her as his mistress. Speaking of which, the man was nice to her, but he was married and she was just a mistress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had thought of tying the man down, but he had told her that she could have anything she wanted as long as she did not get pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she repeatedly had abortions! Now, she realized that she had no leverage without a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only get more money by having a child. It was why she was so eager to have herself checked. She only hoped she would have a chance to get pregnant. Once she got pregnant, she would have the means to make sure the baby was born!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Jacqueline Bowman collected her medicine and was about to get into her car, she happened to see a man speaking respectfully to Kyla before opening the car door. Kyla got into the backseat of the car while the man sat in the driver's seat. It seemed he was a chauffeur.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman frowned when she saw the logo on the back of the car as it drove away from the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A Bentley!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she did not know much about the car and could not figure out the specific model, she knew it was not cheap. The starting price might be millions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla is sitting in a luxury car that costs millions of dollars and has a chauffeur?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is going on here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla wasn&rsquo;t wearing any branded goods earlier, but the car... It seems my former prison mate is leading a pretty good life!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman's eyes glimmered as she began to cook up a scheme.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Jacqueline Bowman called Kyla and insisted on visiting her. She also said she had bought some stationery for Nelson and wanted to come over as she was now outside.</p></div>
