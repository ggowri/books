        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To him, there seems to be no possibility of failure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, prepare the operating room," Brian instructed the attending physician.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes!" The doctor agreed, as the Hart family had given their consent, there was no reason for him to object.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After about an hour, Samir's team arrived. During this time, Samir had been focused on reviewing Harley's medical records.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once the team arrived, they had an intense discussion for an hour. By the time they were ready for surgery, it was already dawn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How about taking a break before the surgery?" the attending physician suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This attending physician was also an authoritative figure in the medical field. However, after several hours of conversation with Samir, he was greatly impressed by him. Even some of Samir's surgical viewpoints left him in awe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The attending physician raised some questions, and Samir explained each one with his own perspective. Although they differed from traditional medical viewpoints, they helped the attending physician gain new insights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, the attending physician fully agreed with Samir. He even thought that if Samir couldn't wake Harley up, it might just be up to Harley's luck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, this luck was too slim and almost impossible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, it's essentially Harley's last chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need to rest, let's proceed with the surgery," said Samir.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the group finished preparing for the surgery, they entered the operating room, and Harley was also wheeled in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside the operating room, Lornell watched as Harley passed by him, feeling an indescribable emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since his father said he could save her, then he definitely can.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least, he has never seen his father fail before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she wakes up, he can finally tell her his name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside the operating room, Brian and Valda nervously waited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The surgery would take four hours, but neither of them had any intention of leaving to take a break.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler also stayed with them outside the operating room, and Lornell glanced at Chandler and suddenly asked, "Why did you come to me to save Harley?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until now that Lornell began to think about this question. After all, Chandler didn't seem like someone who had a good relationship with the little guy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tina," Chandler directly gave the answer, "this amusement park was suggested by Tina to Harley."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Lornell blinked his eyes. So it was for Tina! "Is engagement fun?" he suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler looked at Lornell, "What do you think engagement is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's finding a girl who can have children with you in the future," that's his understanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Lornell's concept, his own parents were like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Engagement is not just that," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What else is there?" Lornell asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler looked at the 7-year-old Lornell. Even if the other party was mature for his age, there were some things that were far beyond his age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't need to know now. You'll know when you grow up," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about the future?" Lornell sneered, "Are we just going to wait until we grow up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There are always adults who say things like "you'll understand when you're older," but Chandler never expected to hear those words from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yep, you'll have to wait until you grow up," said Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell may have agreed to an engagement with Harley due to their shared experience during the explosion, which created a bond between them, or perhaps out of sympathy as they were both children at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the end... he and Harley don't have much of a relationship, and no one knows how long this engagement can last.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only after growing up can one know whether Lornell will develop feelings for Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're not much older than me!" said Lornell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler smiled rarely, "Maybe you'll understand when you get to my age."</p></div>
