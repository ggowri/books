        <h1>Chapter 1787</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although she was reluctant to part with the baby, if she gave birth to them, she not only had to face all kinds of criticisms but her parents would have to face the judgment of others too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It seemed that she was only left with two options&mdash;abort the baby without anyone else knowing or&hellip; marry Hadwin Stephenson. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Marry? Hadwin Stephenson and I...' Lina could not help smiling bitterly. She did not expect to find herself faced with this dilemma five years after breaking up. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But if we marry for the baby, will we be happy in such a marriage?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina gently stroked her belly while she was lost in thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On the other hand, Grace, who was in the hospital ward, was somewhat surprised when she learned that Jason intended to let William stay with the Reed family and accompany Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But his relationship with the Reed family..." Grace hesitated. Although she had never wanted to let her feud with Lily impact the child, what would the child think since his mother was in prison now and likely to receive a heavier sentence? Would he hold a grudge against the Reed family?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was not afraid of the kid hating her, but she was scared that William would hurt Jasper, Mick, and... Mason, who would be joining the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As a mother, she wanted to protect her children!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "I'll have someone keep an eye on him, of course! Jasper seems to like him. If we forcefully separate him from Jasper, maybe it'll just make her care more about him! Don't kids like to play with toys that have to be fought over? But if the toy is in front of her, then maybe she won't care about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But William isn't a toy," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So what? Just take it as we&rsquo;re finding Jasper a playmate. If Jasper continues to like him, then I have a way to keep the boy from hurting Jasper. If Jasper doesn't care about the boy anymore, then I'll send him away from the Reed family,&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A child was not a big deal to him. Besides, William must have heard what he had said to Jasper the other night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace hesitated for a moment. It was all they could do now. What she was most worried about was whether Mason would acknowledge her and Jay, as well as... the operation she had to undergo for her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Speaking of which, she was not as worried about her hands. It was just that she would feel guilty and be full of remorse if the operation failed. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next day, Jason went to talk to Dr. Russell about the surgery tomorrow while Grace took a walk in the hospital's small park to get some air. She was accompanied by a caretaker Jason had hired for her, while some bodyguards were standing farther away, protecting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, a figure approached Grace but the bodyguards stopped him before he got close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, I just want to have a word with you before your operation," Brian said slowly as he looked at the person not far away from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said to the bodyguards, "You don't have to stop him. Mr. Hart won't hurt me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She then said to the caretaker beside her, "I want you to stand a little farther away too. I want to have a word with Mr. Hart alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The caretaker looked hesitant, but at Grace's insistence, she walked 20 or 30 meters away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian walked up to Grace. "How are your hands recently?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"They're alright. I&rsquo;m ready for the operation," answered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian glanced at her bandaged hands. "Do you ever regret holding onto me that day? If you had let go, maybe they wouldn't be in such a bad state now."</p></div>
