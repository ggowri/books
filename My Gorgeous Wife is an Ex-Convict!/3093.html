        <h1>Chapter 3091</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;And you, do you really only treat me as a friend? Look at me now and answer me,&quot; he said.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Valda stared at the man who was so close to her. At that moment, his handsome face was not as cold and distant as usual. And she found it hard to take her eyes off it.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;I know you still love me. So,</span></span></span> <span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">are you planning to deceive me or deceive yourself? Are you sure this is really what you want? Just being a friend to me?&quot; Brian sounded quite seductive as he uttered.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;I...I just wanted to...&quot; </span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">She almost used her last bit of willpower to say something that went against her heart when his lips landed on hers, cutting her off.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Suddenly, Valda felt her mind go blank. His kiss seemed to take away all her senses, and she actually quite enjoyed it.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">That night, when they were making love, Valda kept telling herself that it would just be a one-night stand.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Also, she told herself that Brian was drunk, which was why he said these things and did these things to her.</span></span></span> <span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">And she took it as a stolen moment of happiness.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">The next day, when Valda woke up and saw Brian lying next to her with his eyes closed, she suddenly didn’t want to let him go.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">The truth was, she had always been deeply in love with him. But sadly, she didn’t know if she still deserved him.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">She gently lifted her hand and slowly reached out towards the face that was so close to her.</span></span></span> <span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">In fact, he was the person she was most reluctant to part with in her heart.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Her fingers lightly brushed his cheek, feeling his warmth.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Brian, thank you,&quot; she whispered, thanking him for the night they had.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">But just as she was about to pull her hand away, his other hand quickly grabbed her wrist, and Brian slowly opened his eyes. </span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;What do you want to thank me for?&quot; He asked calmly.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Valda&#x27;s face immediately turned red. &quot;You...you heard me?&quot; </span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Mm, I heard you thanking me earlier. So, tell me, what do you want to thank me for?&quot; he asked with a smirk.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Her face grew even redder as she felt embarrassed.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Well, ummm... I just wanna thank you for not giving up looking for me,&quot; She finally managed to explain after a while.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;But you deliberately avoided me even though you returned to Emerald City!&quot; he said, pulling her hand to his lips and kissing it. &quot;From now on, you&#x27;re not allowed to hide from me anymore. If you don&#x27;t wanna move to my place, then I&#x27;ll move in here with you. How about that?&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Valda widened her eyes in shock. &quot;You...you want to move in with me?&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Yes. Anything wrong with it? Don&#x27;t tell me you only wanted to sleep with me,&quot; Brian said.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Valda was stunned as Brian had seldom said stuff like that.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Last night, we both acted on impulse. So, just let it slide.&quot; She stammered.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;But what if I tell you that I wasn&#x27;t acting on impulse? Would you still want to let it slide?&quot; Brian asked.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;But you were clearly drunk yesterday...&quot;</span></span></span></p></div>
