        <h1>Chapter 3699</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she had only taken two steps when her arm was already caught by his hand. "Are you always so decisive? Do you treat other things the same way, just throw them away?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't understand what you mean," she said, twisting her arm, trying to break free from his grip, but she couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just like how you treated me back then, didn't you say you could just throw me away?" he said, "If it was destined to be thrown away, then why did you pick me up in the first place? Why bother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He seemed to be talking about this dress, but it was more like he was talking about himself back then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's body trembled. "I... I didn't throw you away. In my heart, you have always been my most important family member."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyes stared into his, "It was you who hypnotized and made me forget all the emotions about our past, wasn't it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did I choose to hypnotize? Don't you know?" Mason said, "Family, you only treat me as family, but I don't lack family at all!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body shrank a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, you can rest assured," he sneered at her, "I don't love you at all, so you don't have to be afraid that your 'little brother' will violate you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of embarrassment flashed across Veronica's face. "I...I'm not..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And another thing!" He interrupted her, "Don't say anything about treating me like a relative. You and I are not relatives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he let go of her and went straight back to the car. The silver-gray sedan drove into the Reed House.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica stood there blankly, feeling the wind passing over her body, which was so cold that it was bone-chilling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica almost exhaustedly returned to her residence. As soon as she walked into the room, she saw her father and stepmother sitting there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Veronica felt uneasy. Every time her father and stepmother came to see her, </span><span>it was never for anything good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This year, due to her falling out with Mason, the Barlow family's business has plummeted. Her father is no longer as vigorous as he used to be, and all the luxury brands he used to wear are gone. Maybe he sold them or mortgaged them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there something you need?" Veronica asked calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this how you talk to your father? What, can't I come here if I'm not in trouble?" Archer said unkindly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica shrugged indifferently, "If you weren't in trouble, you wouldn't be here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer's expression stiffened, "There's a dinner party in a few days. Dress up and come with me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have to work, I don't have time to attend any dinner parties," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Working, how much money can you earn?" Archer sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least I can earn my own tuition and living expenses," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's just foolish of you!" Archer was getting angrier, "The Reed family has already said they will provide you with living expenses and tuition, but you insist on earning it yourself. Do you think money is that easy to earn?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just don't want to be a parasite anymore!" Veronica said, "For so many years, we've been living off the Reed family like parasites. But once we're no longer with the Reed family, what do we have left that we've earned ourselves?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer couldn't bear to be spoken to like this by his daughter. "Being a parasite is not something ordinary people can do!"</span></p></div>
