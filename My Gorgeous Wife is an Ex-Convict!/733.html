        <h1>Chapter 732</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was dressed in a suit and tie, and his hair was as scrupulously combed as she remembered. His face was cold and handsome. Even his side profile made her heart throb with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Time had been kind to him. Years had passed, and he was as handsome as ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was already covered with wounds and was no longer the same person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if sensing her gaze, Martin Weiss turned his head in her direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost subconsciously, Kyla immediately picked up her son and ran for the exit passageway in the other direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey! Miss, what happened?" the sales assistant shouted at Kyla for her sudden change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss, who was standing on the escalator, saw nothing but a figure running away, flitting across his sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, just for a moment, his face paled. Then, all the people who were following him saw President Weiss, who was known for his calm and composed manner, running speedily down the escalator and toward the exit passageway as if he was crazy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's two bodyguards naturally followed suit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the people still on the escalator, they looked at each other, unable to understand what had just happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss ran almost recklessly. Everything around him seemed to have become unreal, and the only thing in his eyes was the direction in which the figure was running.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's her! It must be her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The figure wore dark clothes while their hair was hastily tied up. It was completely different from the figure he remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, at the sight of their back, his heart started beating so fast as if his body's instinct was reminding him that it was her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over the years, he could not stop thinking about the name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought about her tears and her resolute words!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The funny thing is, what makes her think that it&rsquo;s all over after she was imprisoned?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, it's far from over between her and me! I want to get back what she owes me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after she was released from prison, it was as if she had disappeared from the world. Even though he had sent someone to look for her whereabouts, nothing was found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not expect her to be in Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss ran from the exit passageway to the first floor, he still did not see the figure he was looking for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he saw was the bustling crowd on the first floor of the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's thin lips were pressed into a straight line, and his face looked as though it was covered with ice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, he punched hard at the wall beside him, prompting the bodyguards who caught up with him to scream with shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"President Weiss, your hand is still hurt from before..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scar on Martin Weiss's hand, which he got from breaking the glass at the fair, had only begun to heal over the past two days. However, as he punched the wall, the wound began to open again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The red blood gushed from his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two bodyguards rushed forward to deal with the wound, but Martin Weiss did not seem to feel any pain as he merely frowned deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Since she's in Emerald City, I'll find her even if I have to turn Emerald City over!'</p></div>
