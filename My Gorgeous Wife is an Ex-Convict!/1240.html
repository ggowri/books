        <h1>Chapter 1239</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she wanted to avoid hurting him, it still turned out like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry..." Brian scoffed. "All I got from years of insistence is only sorry! Haha... Haha..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He laughed, but tears fell from his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at Brian's tears until her eyes were covered by a pair of hands. "Stop looking. You've said what you had to say. Let's get back to the car."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Jason's voice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pretty much blindfolded, Grace followed Jason back to the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The black car pulled away slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then did Patrick finally come back to his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was surprised by everything that had happened today. Not only had Jason married Grace, but what was even more surprising was that Grace turned out to be the little girl who Brian had been looking for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It might sound crazy, but it was true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing the way Brian looked right now, Patrick sighed in his heart. Growing up, he rarely saw Brian cry, but Grace had now made Brian cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed it was true that beautiful women were fatal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, let me take you home," said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Home?" Brian sneered. His pale face looked like a mess with those tears. "Yes, I have to go home. There are things I have to do. But Patrick, why do you think I&rsquo;ve persisted for so many years? I met her first. It was me! But all she gave me was a word of sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick kept quiet, not knowing how to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, there were some things in the world that did not bother about who came first and who did not!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Jason returned to Reed Residence. Jason said, "Accompany me to the mourning hall. Since we got married today, I want to tell my father about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," she answered, knowing his father was a pain in his heart and the family he missed the most. He indeed needed to tell his father about a day like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed Jason to the mourning hall, but she came in a very different mood this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Reed's memorial tablet was placed quietly under the lamplight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason put the two marriage licenses in front of the tablet and said nothing. He just quietly stared at the tablet with his father's name engraved on it. It was as if what he wanted to say was already on the two marriage licenses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked up to the memorial tablet and respectfully bowed three times before saying, "Dad, although we've never met, I've become Jay&rsquo;s wife and the daughter-in-law of the Reed family today. Besides, Jay and I have three babies. This family will be bustling with noise and excitement again once the babies are born."</p></div>
