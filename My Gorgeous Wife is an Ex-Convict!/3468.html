        <h1>Chapter 3466</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she found his words a bit strange, she still said, "No matter what happens, I will always feel this way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A smile appeared on his lips, and she couldn't help but stare at him in amazement. His smile was so beautiful that it left her stunned!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Daniel returned home, he was in an extremely bad mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, a play has ended as he finally broke up with Veronica, using such a ridiculous and laughable reason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica asked him if there were any other reasons, his answer of "no" was essentially a death sentence for his own emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was in his first serious relationship with a girl, but unfortunately, he ended up hurting her deeply. What's worse, she was the girl he loved the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he watched Veronica leave, his heart was almost screaming, wanting to tell her all the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... I can't!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that's said, then the Cross family is finished!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, he was just a despicable person who used Veronica's feelings as a bargaining chip for the Cross family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he returned home, his parents immediately asked, "So, did Veronica agree to break up with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Naturally, the old Mr. and Mrs. Cross knew about Mason's request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel looked at his expectant parents and said bitterly, "She agreed, so we've broken up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's good, that's good!" The old Mr. Cross was relieved. As long as his son and Veronica broke up, it meant that he was saved from being charged with corruption and going to jail!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old Mr. Cross's face showed obvious joy, but it made Daniel feel even worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had hurt the girl he loved the most, but his father was so happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The old Mrs. Cross looked apologetic at her son's gloomy expression. "Daniel, your father and I are sorry for what we did. In the future, no matter who you fall in love with, we will support you and won't oppose it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, we will support you!" The old Mr. Cross also echoed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel suddenly had an urge to laugh! Could he still fall in love with someone else in the future? This guilt of using someone else would probably haunt him forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After school started, Daniel and Veronica broke up, which caused a lot of discussion in their class. Veronica also avoided certain situations at school where she might run into Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, if we really met, it would probably be even more awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite her efforts to avoid anything related to Daniel, information about him still reached her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, Veronica, did you know? Daniel is transferring to another school," a classmate whispered gossip into her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Transfer schools?" Veronica was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, isn't it strange? Suddenly saying he wants to transfer schools! Do you think Daniel knew he was going to transfer and used this as an excuse to break up with you? After all, we haven't seen that girl from the photo around Daniel lately! And in those comics and TV shows, isn't it common for the main character to intentionally break up with their partner for some reason, so as not to hurt them with the truth? They'd rather have their partner hate them, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The classmate was sharing their own speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was taken aback. She had seen similar scenes in books or movies before, but... could it be possible? Did Daniel break up with her because of some unavoidable reason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, on the day of the breakup, she had asked Daniel if there was any unavoidable reason for it! Daniel's answer was - there wasn't!</p></div>
