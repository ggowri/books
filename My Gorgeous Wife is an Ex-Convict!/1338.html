        <h1>Chapter 1337</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla Corbyn, once I become the Weiss family's young madam, I won't let you and that b*stard child of yours go! I'll raise that child to be a useless blockhead and leave no room for you to turn things around!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Jason accompanied Kyla Corbyn to the hospital to have her injuries examined. Fortunately, Kyla Corbyn only suffered some skin injuries and did not hurt any bones or muscles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After sending Kyla Corbyn home, Grace was still upset with Paisley Daniels for such a despicable act.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me, does Kyla really trust Martin Weiss to take care of Nelson? Once Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels are married, that woman will become Nelson's stepmother!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "She naturally has her reasons. Alright, calm down. It's not good for pregnant women to be angry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I just find it unfair for Kyla. Can't Martin Weiss see that Paisley Daniels was pretending?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Perhaps he could but he tolerated it. As far as I know, Martin Weiss got together with Paisley Daniels because he got a disease and needed a bone marrow transplant when the Weiss family was at their lowest. Then, they found a suitable bone marrow candidate in the bone marrow bank," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It happened to be Paisley Daniels?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Jason nodded. "Paisley Daniels donated her bone marrow to Martin Weiss, so that's how they met."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But aren't these usually anonymous? How did they meet?" Grace asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Paisley Daniels had a boyfriend who was a doctor in the hospital where Martin Weiss was in. I think Paisley Daniels met Martin Weiss through that boyfriend. But I only made a passing inquiry while looking up the whereabouts of the attending doctor you're looking for. I didn't look into it in detail," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Any word on the attending doctor?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We have some clues. I think we'll find them soon," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good." Grace's frown relaxed. She had finally heard some good news. "I hope we can find out the truth soon and clear Kyla's name."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is the truth so important?" Jason asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said with great certainty, "Of course, it is! If you're blinded all your life and don't know the truth, won&rsquo;t you become just like Martin Weiss who doesn&rsquo;t know right from wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But sometimes, knowing the truth isn't necessarily a good thing," he said, looking at her thoughtfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But if it were me, I would rather live my life knowing the truth instead of being kept in the dark and deceived by facades," she said. It was why she studied law and chose to become a lawyer in the first place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pursed his thin lips slightly as he gently looked down. He seemed to be enveloped by a layer of desolation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you think it's not a good idea for Martin Weiss to know the truth that Paisley Daniels framed Kyla?" asked Grace as she took Jason's face in her hands, making them look at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's a good idea." The corners of Jason's lips raised slightly, and he smiled faintly as he said, "If Martin Weiss knows the truth, then there's a chance to turn the custody case around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there were some truths he wished he could hide forever and never let them see the light of day!</p></div>
