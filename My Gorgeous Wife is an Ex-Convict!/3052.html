        <h1>Chapter 3050</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I understand," Valda gently patted Grace's shoulder. "You don't need to say anything. If I were in this situation, I think you would help me too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace let out a "wow" and hugged Valda, crying in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda kept comforting Grace in a gentle voice, saying "Grace, don't worry. I will definitely bring Jasmine back safely tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope you stay safe and sound. If anything unexpected happens to you, then I...I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'm safe and sound too. We'll all be safe and sound!" Valda said, hoping that this storm would pass quickly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she brings Jasmine back safely, Grace will be happy and Brian won't be tormented by guilt and pain. Everything will be okay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason watched his weeping wife and Valda, who was comforting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt that Valda in front of him had impressed him. Many people desire the Reed family's favor, but this woman could refuse so decisively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I have to say, Grace has a good eye for making friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Brian stood by with a worried expression in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because Valda needs to pick up her child tomorrow, she is going back to her room to rest first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the Barlow family's side, they have been arranging rooms in the house for Valda and Brian over the past few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon entering the room, Brian said, "I'm sorry, Valda. Tomorrow I'll have to ask you to take such a risk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda shook her head and said, "You don't need to apologize to me. As I said before, this is not your fault at all. And... I'm glad I can help with this matter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tomorrow, no matter what, you must pay attention to your safety. Get a good night's sleep, and Jason and I will work with the police to come up with the best plan to protect you," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." Valda sweetly smiled, showing full trust towards the other person in her smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Brian looked at her smiling face, he felt a heavy weight in his heart. She shouldn't have had to face such danger in the first place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And he, repeatedly promising a future where she would not encounter any danger again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now, she still has to face danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? Why do you have that expression? Go pick up Jasmine, I'm not forcing you at all!" said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm afraid you might encounter danger!" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I believe I will be safe!" she said, pulling out a safety charm from her pocket. It was the one he had bought for her at the booth on the high tower. "Look, this is the safety charm you gave me. I will keep it with me. Tomorrow, I will also wear this safety charm, and it will protect both me and Jasmine, keeping us safe and sound."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After speaking, she carefully put the amulet back into her pocket, then hugged him. "Brian, I don't want you to be upset. If you're upset, I'll be upset too. So, don't be sad. At least have some confidence in me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'm not sad," he murmured, "I believe that you will definitely come back safely with Jasmine tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mmm, that's right!" She laughed again, then stood on her tiptoes and kissed him on the lips. "I love you!" Because she loved him, she had the courage to face unknown dangers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Valda fell asleep, Brian looked at her sleeping face on the bed. He gently opened his thin lips and said, "Valda, no matter what happens, you must be safe and sound!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In response to him, there was the sound of her steady breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian finally turned off the light for her, then turned around and left the room.</p></div>
