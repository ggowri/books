        <h1>Chapter 904</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I don't know," Paisley Daniels said awkwardly. 'Who on earth was that phone call from? Who is Martin going to stop?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who... exactly was he referring to?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do we do? Does&hellip; Martin not want to marry Paisley? Is that why he left?" Mrs. Daniels said anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the Daniels family was originally just the owner of a third-rate small company, but it got into high society because of the Weiss family's help all these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who did not know that the Daniels family depended on the Weiss family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people even secretly compared the Daniels family to a parasite that fed off the Weiss family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the Weiss family and the Daniels family failed to associate themselves through this marriage, then the Daniels family would go back to square one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How is that possible? The Weiss family has already accepted the wedding date. How could anything go wrong?" Mr. Daniels snapped at his wife and whispered, "Alright, there are so many people here today. Try to act like nothing has happened!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Daniels could only muster a smile as she faced the guests around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her red lips pressed tightly together, Paisley Daniels looked toward the exit of the banquet hall where Martin Weiss had disappeared to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had called out to Martin so loudly just now, but he did not look back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he had forgotten all about her and everything around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who was able to make him leave on such an important occasion?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A strong sense of uneasiness welled up in Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla watched as the movers loaded the truck with all the luggage they could not carry with them before turning to her mother and son. "Alright, Mom. Let's eat before going to the train station."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson asked with his beautiful eyes wide open, "Mommy, are we never coming back to Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We..." Kyla was in a trance. She did not even know how long they were going to hide from Martin Weiss. "When you're older, we can live wherever we like, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I like it here. Aunty Grace is here," said Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled. Getting to know Grace in Emerald City was probably her greatest luck. If it were not for Grace, Nelson would not have been equipped with one of the best hearing aids so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not help Grace with her heartbreak at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let's go." Kyla took her son's hand as they left the house they had briefly rented.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a simple meal nearby, the three took the subway to the train station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was still early as it was only 2.30 PM, and there was still more than an hour left before the train&rsquo;s departure time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla and her mother found a place to sit down in the station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unlike her son who was looking around curiously, Kyla looked worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" asked Mrs. Corbyn when she saw her daughter's worried look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I don't know. I keep feeling like something's going to happen," said Kyla. Her heart was beating hard for no reason. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're leaving Emerald City soon. What can happen? Besides, Martin Weiss's not in Emerald City either. I learned from the news that he's attending a banquet with Paisley Daniels in S City today. The two families are getting married soon."</p></div>
