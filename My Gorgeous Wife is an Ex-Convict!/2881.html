        <h1>Chapter 2879</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because I'll only make you love me more," he said before suddenly bending over and kissing her lips heavily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss was domineering and forceful, not allowing her to reject him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried to push him away, but he pressed her hands behind her back so that her body had no choice but to press closer to him and accept the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss reminded her of the night he had gotten drunk. He was also this forceful, not allowing her to refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had gotten away that night, would they not have been entangled with each other like this? However, she could not help longing for his touch and half-willingly spent the night with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was furious at his forcefulness but more furious at herself for submitting without putting up a fight. Even then, she still loved him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her tears ran down her cheeks and fell on her lips as well as Brian's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The slightly salty taste made him freeze and stop the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She... was crying!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian suddenly felt helpless. He raised his hand and wiped away the tears on her face. "Don't cry. I won't force you like this anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his words made her cry even harder. "Boo0hoo... Brian, you don't keep your word. You said we could break up any time I wanted, but look at what y-you're doing now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just..." He paused. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Just what? I just don't want to break up with her and become strangers?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he told her she could decide when they broke up, he had no idea he would be reluctant one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sobbed. "Just what? Do you think I'm a pushover? Brian... I... I love you, but so what? I... I have the right to choose. I can choose what path I want to take in the future, what kind of life I want to lead, and whether I want to have children! You... You have no right to choose for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stammered as she sobbed. Her every word was like a sharp needle stabbing at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, Valda. I'm sorry..." He held her in his arms like a treasure he did not want to let go of. "I just don't want us to end like this. Give me one more chance, okay? You said you would make me fall for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no way she could do it! She was silent. When he left the comic fiesta without looking back, she knew she did not stand a chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loved Grace so much that his fondness for her was nothing in front of that love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller had no idea how long she cried. She fell asleep when she was exhausted from crying. When she woke up the next day, Brian was already gone, and the two female bodyguards were looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller sighed. It seemed Brian had not changed his mind. If she was really pregnant, everything would be a mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even with the morning-after pill, it was too late. Valda Theller could only go with the flow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After turning on her laptop, she started working.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the hospital ward, Brian sat in a chair while the three members of the Theller family stood in front of Brian. On either side of the three were several burly men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked through the information in his hand, and his handsome face was full of indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three members of the Theller family looked uneasy and afraid. Especially Wynne, who was even trembling.</p></div>
