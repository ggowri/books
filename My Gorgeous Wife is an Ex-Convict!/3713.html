        <h1>Chapter 3711</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what's the secret phrase..." she asked, but halfway through her sentence, she realized it was a silly question. How could he tell her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about you? Do you want to try that possibility?" he asked, staring at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt her heart pounding, her intuition telling her that if she missed this chance, he and she might really become strangers from now on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She missed the old times and wanted to be with him again, even if they weren't siblings but had a different relationship. She...wanted to give it a try!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do." The word came out of her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled imperceptibly, his gaze becoming even deeper. "Then prove it. Prove that you really want it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prove it? How?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was puzzled, looking at Mason's eyes, suddenly understanding something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Prove it? Prove that she really wanted to try a different kind of relationship with him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze shifted from his eyes to his lips, and then, as if gathering all her courage, she lowered her head and kissed him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never thought she would take the initiative to kiss him like this before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now she had done it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Were they really just like siblings? They had no blood relation, and her feelings for him, were they really just sisterly? Or was she afraid that if she broke the sibling relationship, their previous intimacy would be lost forever?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would they fight and argue like lovers, and eventually break up... and in the end, all their feelings would be gone?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But between them, it had already become like this. What else did she have to be afraid of losing?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nothing, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips left a warm imprint on his, mixed with the taste of tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He passively accepted the kiss, slowly closing his eyes, as if feeling the specialness of this kiss for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After so many years, it seemed like everything had returned to the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had been willing to try this back then, he thought he would have been happy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, he wanted to try it to see if the hypnosis had really made him completely forget his feelings for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if that was the case, why did he save her, stay overnight at her house, and even feel heartbroken when he saw her tears?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or was it because the hypnosis was wearing off?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or was it because of something else...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wanted to figure out what Veronica meant to him now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer and Rosalind had thought that Crispin had left the banquet hall with Veronica and hadn't returned because the deal with the Clark family had been sealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were happy, but the next morning they received a call from the Clark family saying that the deal was off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hurriedly looked for Crispin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Ward, we didn't understand what you said on the phone... We had a good deal before, didn't we?" Archer said.</span></p></div>
