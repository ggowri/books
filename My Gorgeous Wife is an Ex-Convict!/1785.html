        <h1>Chapter 1783</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'No, I can't let him find out. Otherwise, we'll probably get more entangled with each other.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Why do you look so uneasy sitting beside me? Am I that scary?" Hadwin Stephenson's voice suddenly rang in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I'm just worried about the compensation for the damages!" Lina said guiltily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Were you never going to ride in my car again if you hadn&rsquo;t scratched my car?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She bit her lip. For a moment, she had no idea how to answer him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson did not wait for her answer either. He turned and looked out of the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car stopped at a restaurant, which was quite famous in Emerald City. Hadwin Stephenson had brought her here when they were dating back then. She enjoyed many of the dishes here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, when Lina looked at the dishes on the table before her, she had no appetite even though Hadwin Stephenson had ordered her favorite dishes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at Lina and asked, "Why aren't you eating? Or is eating at the same table with me unbearable?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina laughed dryly. "You're overthinking. We... We&rsquo;re only broken up. We're not mortal enemies. I... I don't find having a meal with you unbearable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She picked up a piece of sweet and sour prawn from the table and began to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had only taken a few mouthfuls when the familiar feeling of nausea came surging up her throat. Lina was only glad that the private room Hadwin Stephenson had chosen had its own bathroom, so she did not have to go outside to throw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She ran into the bathroom, locked the door, leaned over the sink, and threw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Blaargh... Blaargh..." Lina felt her stomach emptying as she threw up. She had thrown up until there was nothing else left in her stomach. Then, she gargled her mouth. She looked up at her pale face in the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She previously thought morning sickness was common after reading about it in novels and watching it happen on TV dramas. She never thought it was a big deal. However, now that she was experiencing it herself, she realized how uncomfortable it was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What was she going to do with the baby?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina straightened her clothes and walked out of the bathroom. She suddenly stopped, and her face that was pale from vomiting turned even paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because Hadwin Stephenson was looking at a test report in his hand while sitting on a chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was her... pregnancy test report!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was shocked. She immediately rushed over, wanting to grab the report in his hand. She hoped that he did not understand what the data meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before her hand could touch the report, he raised his hand and made her miss her aim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, he turned his head. There was a rare look of shock in his beautiful, deep eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had become more introverted over the years. Few things could shock him, but the report he was holding had set off waves in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're... pregnant?" Hadwin Stephenson asked Lina in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How... How could I be pregnant? Give me back my report," said Lina. There was only some data on the report. The word &lsquo;pregnant&rsquo; was not on it. Anyway, she was just going to deny it no matter what.</p></div>
