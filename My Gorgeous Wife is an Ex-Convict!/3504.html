        <h1>Chapter 3502</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing his son's expression, Jason knew the answer, "So when do you plan to let her know? Once the trial begins, your appearance will inevitably require a reasonable explanation to the judge, and she will eventually find out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason remained silent, naturally understanding what his father had said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So when do you plan to tell her? You can't possibly wait until the day of the trial for her to find out," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll tell her at the right time," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then do it as soon as possible," Jason said. "From my experience, the longer you keep something hidden, the bigger the reaction might be when the other person finds out. It's better to be honest from the beginning, rather than having the other person find out from someone else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's eyes flickered slightly. "Experience? Did father also keep something from mother before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason was blunt. "Yes, when your mother and I were together, I also deliberately kept some things from her. I thought I could keep it hidden forever, that she would never find out. But in the end, when she found out from someone else, I realized that all my assumptions were just my own wishful thinking. If I had told her myself, maybe the damage to her would have been smaller."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking back to what happened back then, Jason still felt a sense of fear, but also a sense of gratitude. He was grateful that when Grace found out the truth, her love for him was deep enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand," Mason said. He wouldn't hurt Veronica, so even if he didn't want to talk to her about it, he would still do it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the next few days, Veronica recuperated at the Reed family's home, and Mason was almost always by her side. Even at night, when Veronica went to sleep, Mason stayed with her until she fell asleep before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Jasper couldn't help but envy Veronica a little and said, "Veronica, Mason is so good to you. If Mason were ever that good to me, I would be so happy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt a little embarrassed, after all, Jasper was Mason's blood-related sister. "Well... should I talk to Mason and ask him to be nicer to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, if you did that, then Mason would only be nice to me because of our relationship, not because of me," Jasper quickly waved her hand and said, "But now Mason is treating me pretty well too. He's much better than when we were kids, so I'm actually quite satisfied."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While speaking, Jasper noticed the necklace hanging on Veronica's neck. "Hey, isn't that the necklace you used to attack the kidnapper back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, Mason took the necklace back, cleaned it, and gave it back to me," Veronica said. "That necklace really came in handy back then." She lifted her hand and gently touched the necklace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Veronica's expression, Jasper suddenly leaned in and whispered, "Veronica, do you have a little crush on my brother Mason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Veronica was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper quickly added, "I mean like-like, not brother-sister kind of like. You don't have a boyfriend right now, so... would you consider my brother Mason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Jasper hasn't developed her own feelings yet, it doesn't mean she can't see other people's emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, there are many classmates in her own class who are in relationships, so she can understand some of Mason's feelings. Moreover, if it weren't for Veronica, she wouldn't even be able to imagine who Mason would date in the future.</p></div>
