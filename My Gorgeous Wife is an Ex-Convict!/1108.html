        <h1>Chapter 1107</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What happened?' Before Grace knew it, another cold voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Today, no one can leave if I don't want them to leave!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a second, Grace felt as if her blood was about to freeze. It was... Jason's voice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked up and saw nothing but a tall figure standing only a few dozen meters away from them. There was a row of people standing behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if... they had been waiting there for a long time. They were now inviting them into the trap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that I was careless." Brian looked coldly at Jason who was not far away. "Did you do this on purpose? Just to lure me here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were not for Dr. Russell, he would not have found this place so easily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason did not answer but only looked at Grace who was standing behind Brian. "What about you? Are you still going to follow Brian even though I'm willing to give my all?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace watched as Jason walked over step by step. His beautiful face was now icy, while the eyes that had looked at her gently this morning were now gloomy and exuding a sense of danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you believe me if I told you I wasn't going to leave?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sneered, "You were already walking out of the mansion with him. You even..." Jason walked to Grace and Brian, putting his hand on their intertwined hands. "...did this. How am I supposed to believe you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's heart sank, and bitterness spread across her chest. "You don't believe me, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want me to believe you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, it was her turn to laugh. She previously thought they might have another possibility, but she had overestimated themselves after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, you told me you'd believe and listen to every word I say without doubt or suspicion," she said bitterly. His words were still in her ears, but now, it was clear he did not believe her at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you hadn't chosen to leave with Brian today, then I would believe you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what's this... A test?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well&hellip; Do you love me?" he asked suddenly while his eyes stared at her darkly. "If you say you love me now, then I'll believe you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... the so-called belief was just a self-deceiving belief. The belief she wanted was never this kind of belief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her silence made the gloom in his eyes grow stronger. "Say it. I'll believe you as long as you say you love me. I'll believe what you said earlier, that you didn't want to leave with Brian!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a lunge, Brian came between Jason and Grace. "I'm the one who wanted to take Grace away. Whatever you want to do, come at me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's words seemed to provoke Jason. He suddenly smiled coldly. "Yes, of course, I'll come at you. It seems that just breaking one of your hands wasn't enough. the Hart family and the Reed family have always minded their own business. Brian, are you really going to make me an enemy?"</p></div>
