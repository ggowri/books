        <h1>Chapter 445</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loosened his hold slightly but continued to hug her. &ldquo;Sis, don&rsquo;t ever tell me that you want to break up, okay?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lowered his head. There was a growing sense of distress in his glittering eyes that she had never seen before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if her telling him she wanted a breakup was something so devastating that he would become lost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she... that important to him? So important that he could not even accept a hypothetical scenario?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt as if something was stuck in her heart. It made her feel uncomfortable. She could not hold herself back from raising her hands and returning the hug to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Okay, Jay. I&rsquo;ll never say the word &lsquo;breakup&rsquo;.&rdquo; This promise was pledged by her just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, she did not think further about the meaning and price behind this promise. Right now, she just did not want to see him looking like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That would just make her feel horrible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the afternoon, Grace and Jason returned to the hospital. Her check-up reports were ready to be collected. Her main issues were from her old injuries. Although those injuries had been healed, whenever the weather turned cold and humid, some of her joints would still ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, according to the doctor, she just needed a long time to recuperate. Her condition would improve. It was not a major problem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The big headache was the injury suffered by her uterus back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The gynecologist told her during the consultation that she needed to go through a series of recuperative care to a certain extent before they could proceed with an operation. Perhaps then they could improve the prognosis of her uterus and she might get a chance to conceive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I still have a chance to have a baby?&rdquo; Grace was excited by that prospect because that was a wish that she had suppressed deep within her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, there was hope for that wish to come to fruition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to see later depending on how well your body recuperates. As of now, you have about a 30% chance,&rdquo; the specialist told her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">30% was probably low for a normal person, but for Grace, it was a good number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then, let&rsquo;s start the process.&rdquo; Jason was the one to make the decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After they collected the medication, Grace and Jason finally left the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Jason, thank you!&rdquo; Grace said with reddened eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why are you thanking me again? There&rsquo;s no need for thanks between us.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t brought me over for a check-up, I wouldn&rsquo;t have found out that I still have a chance to be a mother in the future,&rdquo; Grace mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, there was hope for her to be a mother. She could have someone who had blood relations with her. It was as if she suddenly felt less lonely!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason quietly looked at Grace who had some excitement in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This seemed to be the first time she was excited not because of her family or friends whom she cared for but for herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, she seemed to have accepted fate&rsquo;s cruel arrangement for her. More accurately, her heart had given up on life. She had given up on her future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yet right now, she seemed to have some hope for her future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re planning to have a child that belongs to you and me, right?&rdquo; he asked.</p></div>
