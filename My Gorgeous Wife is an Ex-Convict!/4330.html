        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at Tina and said, "Do you know? When I have a bug attack, there is a possibility of losing my sanity. Although you can help me relieve the pain, in the process, I may also hurt you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No! "She said with great certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He </span><span>frowned,</span><span> how could she be so certain about something he couldn't even be certain of himself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because when you had a bug attack before, you never hurt me! "Tina said. At that time, even though he felt extreme pain, he had to desperately push her away and refused to approach her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he possibly hurt her like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled wryly and said, "Tina, don't trust me too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are my husband, why don't I believe you? "Tina asked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fixed his gaze on her for a long time before slowly saying, "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This is their promise to each other!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina smiled happily, like a big stone that had been in her heart for a long time, finally let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days later, Chandler placed a bottle of medicine in front of Lornell and said, "Here you are."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell looked at the medicine bottle and raised his eyebrows, "Tina told you that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She didn't say it, I guessed it, but based on your reaction, it should be from you, "Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell smiled wryly and said, "I can't hide it from you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What terms did she use in exchange for you bringing her into the Quentin family? "Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you give birth in the future, leave some samples of umbilical cord blood and placenta for me to study, and at the same time, she will provide a certain amount of blood samples for me to study! "Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's face became serious, his gaze fixed coldly on Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell shrugged: "Alright, I'll be careful. As long as she has a small blood sample, she won't need any more. It's also beneficial for you to study this for the Quentin family. After all, this curse will continue to your descendants. Perhaps you and Tina's children, or your descendants, will have someone inherit the curse and have insects in their bodies? Perhaps the Quentin family will develop a special medicine for this, and then it will also be beneficial for you It's a good thing."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler tightly pursed his thin lips and said after a long time, "Don't give Tina this potion again in the future, otherwise don't blame me for not showing mercy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell withdrew the potion and said to Chandler, "Alright, I see. It's your Hunter family who needs to think about how to fulfill your previous promise to my grandfather."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there was a transaction between the Hunter family and the Quentin family before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm. "Chandler responded lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Lornell was about to leave, Chandler suddenly asked, "How's it going between you and Harley?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you suddenly mention this? "Lornell exclaimed, after all, Chandler has never liked to meddle in others' affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back then, you got engaged to Harley because you were curious about Tina and I being unmarried. Although you saved her life, you also bound her in the form of a marriage agreement. I also hope that there will be a good outcome between you and her, but over the years, you don't seem to have much affection for her, "Chandler said.</span></p></div>
