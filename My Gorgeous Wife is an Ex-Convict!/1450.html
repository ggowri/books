        <h1>Chapter 1449</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was sad when she thought of Lina's resilience, but she was more proud than anything to have such a strong friend. She knew Lina would not be defeated so easily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though Lina had broken up with Hadwin Stephenson, she did not give up on herself but chose to cooperate with the treatment to recover. She had even jokingly said to her, "Isn't it only a breakup? How big of a deal is it? Few people get married after dating their first loves these days. At best, I'm just following the crowd. Maybe Mr. Right will come to me once I leave the hospital!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's optimism made Grace believe that Lina would be happy in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's good." Kyla Corbyn was also slightly relieved. "Grace, you and Lina shouldn't end up like me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She would never fall in love again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two of them did not notice that the ward&rsquo;s door was not closed. A figure flashed faintly outside the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace and Jason returned to Reed Residence. Grace was about to go upstairs, but Jason pulled her into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter?" she could not help asking. The sudden embrace seemed a little unusual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On their way home today, he had spoken very little and would only look at her while in a daze. However, he had said it was alright when she asked him what was bothering him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I just wanted to give you a hug," muttered Jason. He recalled her and Kyla Corbyn's conversation through the crack of the door when he accompanied Martin Weiss to Kyla Corbyn's ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Kyla Corbyn said she could not accept someone who had hurt her, Martin Weiss had staggered and needed to put his fist in his mouth to silence his sobs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, it seemed that even crying had become a luxury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't you hug me every day? Haven&rsquo;t you had enough?" Grace laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's not enough." It might never be enough for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at the hands that were gently wrapped around her protruding belly... Those were his hands. They were so beautiful and clean as if they were otherworldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, things between Kyla and Martin Weiss are probably over now," Grace said out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stiffened slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I had a chat with Kyla today. Kyla said that she will never again accept someone who has hurt her. She can&rsquo;t accept them no matter how much she used to love that person. People's feelings change. No matter how much they love someone, that love will eventually be devoured by time and pain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace muttered. She could relate to her conversation with Kyla Corbyn today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was like how she had once loved Sean. Even though she had not loved Sean to the extent that she could sacrifice everything for him, she could still say that he was her first love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, after Sean hurt her, that love was eventually gone and vanished into smoke!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's breathing seemed to be getting a little hurried. He heard Grace's voice saying, "I think Kyla's right. After all, I wouldn't accept someone who has hurt me too."</p></div>
