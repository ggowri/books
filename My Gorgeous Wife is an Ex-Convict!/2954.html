        <h1>Chapter 2952</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment just now, he had an impulse to hide her away, to a place where only he could see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How much does he really like her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Brian Hart suggested, could it be that he has already fallen in love with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One morning, Valda was busy with work, as she had previously been delayed due to taking care of Brian in the hospital because of his injury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the afternoon, she received a call from the police station asking her to come over to verify her previous statement. The police informed her that the woman who drugged Camille at the bar and took her away has been detained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the call from the police station ended, Camille Strickland also called and said that the police asked her to go to the station in the afternoon to identify someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So the two of them agreed on a time and went to the police station together in the afternoon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the police station, the authorities asked Camille to identify the woman. Once she confirmed without a doubt, they had both of them redo the statement again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two also learned from the police that the woman had colluded with the hotel landlady to specifically target women who were alone in the bar, finding ways to drug them and then take them back to the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And these women, upon waking up, found themselves violated. In addition, videos and photos were taken of them, so naturally they dared not report to the police. Moreover, many of them were even blackmailed or forced to comply with the perpetrators' demands in order to prevent the videos and photos from being leaked. As a result, they were trapped in a vicious cycle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was stunned to hear that there were underground dealings like this in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you all for your help in enabling us to successfully dismantle this criminal organization," expressed the police with gratitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where... where..." Valda repeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille felt a wave of fear. If Valda hadn't found her in time, her fate would have been unimaginable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they walked out of the police station, Camille said, "Valda, you're like my guardian angel! Without you, I might have been done for!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I hadn't gone to the bathroom, you wouldn't have encountered this situation," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's none of your business. It was my own carelessness. I didn't guard myself properly and the bad guys took advantage of it," said Camille. "By the way, how is the prince's injury?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have been discharged from the hospital," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good. I'm safe this time, and I should thank the Crown Prince properly. But how should I thank him?" Camille was having trouble deciding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sending a banner or a thank-you letter? I doubt the prince would even accept them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Alternatively, she could invite the Crown Prince to a meal. However, many people have already extended such invitations to him. Even if she were to invite him, there is no guarantee that he would accept.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Alternatively, should we give a gift or money? I reckon if we present it to the prince, it would be a joke!</p></div>
