        <h1>Chapter 3834</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Jasper and William left the hospital, Jasper suddenly stopped in his tracks. "Did Daniel really say that Lawrence encouraged him to do all this?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," William replied. "But the police have already questioned Lawrence, and he didn't admit to anything. At the same time, Daniel's testimony is just one-sided, and </span><span>there is no evidence to prove that it was really Lawrence who encouraged him. It could be that Daniel deliberately implicated someone else to reduce his own guilt."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If he really wanted to implicate someone else to reduce his guilt, why would he implicate Lawrence? Daniel and Lawrence don't even know each other, and he probably doesn't even know Lawrence exists!" Jasper exclaimed loudly, his face filled with a painful contradiction.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she learned that Daniel's testimony mentioned Lawrence, the feeling was like being heavily cut by a sharp blade, it was extremely painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence? How could it be Lawrence?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Lawrence be involved with Daniel? Even if Lawrence hated the Reed family, hated her, but the revenge she imagined did not include the death of her family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel's actions almost caused Mason and Veronica to lose their lives.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't believe that Lawrence was the mastermind behind all this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if it wasn't Lawrence, why did Daniel mention him in his testimony?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her mind was filled with all kinds of contradictions, constantly debating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know you don't want it to be Lawrence. The police will eventually find out the truth. If it's not Lawrence, he won't be falsely accused, and Daniel won't get a reduced sentence because of it," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what if it is Lawrence?!" Jasper's voice trembled as her hands clenched tightly at her side. The mere possibility made her feel physically ill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it is him, then I will help you in the way you want," William replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's eyes widened suddenly. "What...do you mean?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I mean, if it really is him, and you want him to go to jail, we don't have to do anything. We can just wait for the legal system to take its course. After all, your parents won't let the person who almost killed Mason get away, even if it's Lawrence."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William paused for a moment. "But if you don't want him to go to jail, then I will find a way to clear his name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Jasper looked shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's simple statement of "finding a way to clear his name" would likely involve a lot of resources and connections, and might even lead to him committing a crime himself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?" William reached out to touch Jasper's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...don't have to do something like this for Lawrence," Jasper murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not for him. I just don't want you to regret anything related to Lawrence in the future," William said. "If he really did commit a crime, and you didn't help him, you might feel guilty and regretful. That's the last thing I want to see."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even so, I don't want you to commit a crime for Lawrence's sake," Jasper said. "If we let a criminal go free by making an innocent person commit a crime, what's the point? We'll just end up with another criminal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." William began.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper interrupted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Like you said, if Lawrence really did commit the crime and ends up in jail, I'll feel </span><span>guilty and regretful. But if you commit a crime to protect him, won't I feel guilty and miserable too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William pursed his thin lips, seeming unsure of what to say.</span></p></div>
