        <h1>Chapter 3955</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her lips touched his, and the cool sensation spread from his lips to hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it wasn't the first time she had kissed him, every kiss made her nervous, afraid that he would push her away, afraid of seeing disgust in his eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She tentatively touched his lips with her tongue, and when she was sure he didn't want to push her away, she became bolder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy deepened the kiss, and her tongue entered Mick's mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to make sure of his interest in her, and her body was her bargaining chip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The touch of lips and teeth, the entanglement of tongues...at first, she took the initiative, but later, he took control.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was almost out of breath from the kiss. When it finally ended, she gasped for air and blushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stay by my side from now on, and maybe my liking for you will grow." She heard him say this in her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Mick and Nancy left the restaurant, several people walked out of another private room in the restaurant, and some of them happened to see Mick and Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, that's Mick. He's dining here today too," one of the women said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These people were all second or third-generation wealthy people in Emerald City, and some of them had been trying to curry favor with the Reed family. Naturally, they recognized Mick at a glance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who is the woman next to him? Is she from the Reed family? It's rare to see him dining with a woman," someone asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not his sister... Oh, Clarissa, that woman seems to be your sister," another person said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa had already noticed that the person walking with Mick to the restaurant and about to get into the car was Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa's sister? Oh, the one brought in by her stepmother, right? I remember Clarissa used to boss her sister around and treat her like a servant," someone said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hehe, she used to be a servant, but now that her sister has hooked up with Mick, she's going to be someone important. Who knows who will be the servant then!" another person joked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's friends teased her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa's face turned extremely ugly, and she almost bit her teeth off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she possibly suck up to that bitch Nancy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, while Nancy was working at the hotel, she suddenly received a call from the Schultz family, saying that her mother had left something at the Schultz family's place and asked her to come and get it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Nancy arrived at the Schultz family's place, she found Clarissa and her former stepfather Francis Schultz waiting for her in the living room, and the atmosphere was clearly not friendly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are my mother's things?" Nancy asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No rush, you'll get them later," Francis Schultz said. "I heard you've been getting close to Mick from the Reed family lately?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy looked at Francis warily. It seemed that today was not just about getting her mother's things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't look at me like that. After all, we're still family. Now that you're close to Mick, it's a good thing. If you need any help from the Schultz family, just ask," Francis said, pretending to be a kind father.</span></p></div>
