        <h1>Chapter 1561</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the following days, Jasper's kindergarten enrollment procedures were all completed. She and Mick would be attending the same kindergarten and were also arranged to be in the same class.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper could not be happier after knowing she could be in the same kindergarten as her brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed solemnly promised his parents that he would take good care of his sister in kindergarten and never let others bully her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at her son's solemn appearance, Grace found him pretty adorable. Her son was also a little kid. If anything happened, he would probably need others to protect him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Grace was happy that the siblings were getting along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Can Daddy go with me on my first day of kindergarten?" Jasper Reed's eyes stared intently at Jason with an obvious longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason seemingly raised his eyebrows with slight surprise. "Do you want me to accompany you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Because a lot of kids' dads go to kindergarten with them on the first day of school!" said Jasper Reed. Although it was not her first day of school, it was her first day of kindergarten!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She previously only had her mother to accompany her. Now, she finally had a father as well... She wanted her father and mother to accompany her like everyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one could not wait to experience what it was like to have her father accompany her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Let's go to the kindergarten together tomorrow," said Jason. Jasper was instantly delighted and opened her arms, wanting her father to hug her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together tightly. He was a little uncomfortable with his daughter's initiative. After all, his son was not clingy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, facing his daughter's almond-shaped eyes that were similar to Grace's, Jason still bent down and picked her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one put her arms around Jason's neck and kissed him on the cheek. "Thank you, Daddy. Daddy's the best."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her soft and young voice seemed to touch the tender part at the bottom of his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace knew that she had been raising her daughter as a single mother all this while. Her daughter grew up without a father, so she naturally longed for him more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her eyes fell on her son nearby. 'Does Mick also long for his mother? Does he want his mother standing by his side on special occasions as well?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mick." Grace opened her arms to her son. "Do you want me to hug you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one said somewhat uneasily, "I'm not my sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, there was a longing in the little one's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace smiled, picked up her son, and kissed him on the cheek. "I'll send you and your sister to kindergarten every day from now on, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one blinked and asked suddenly, "Is it because she's going to kindergarten?" 'Is Mommy just sending me too because she's sending her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, it's because of both of you. Even if Jasper isn&rsquo;t going to kindergarten, I&rsquo;ll still send you all the same.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had too many things to deal with as soon as she came back. Although she had finished some work on hand before coming here, there were still some follow-up problems to deal with.</p></div>
