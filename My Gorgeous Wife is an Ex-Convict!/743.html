        <h1>Chapter 742</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had also figured it out these days. If it was doomed that she and Martin Weiss would be entangled with each other again and if it was doomed that Martin Weiss would find her, then when the day came, she would just let him take his revenge to his heart's content.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However..." Grace wanted to say more, but Kyla gently took her hand and said, "I know you want to help me. I'm really happy to have a friend like you. It's just... This is something between Martin Weiss and me. It&rsquo;ll have to be settled eventually."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, Kyla added, "Grace, I have only one thing to ask of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's expression was solemn and serious, which made Grace's heart tremble suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just hope that if... Martin Weiss does find me, then maybe I won't be able to visit my mother and Nelson for a while. I hope you can take care of them when the time comes. After all, one is old, one is young, and both are incapable," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had left all her money to her mother, but... She was still worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to Martin Weiss, her friends had all distanced themselves from her. Now, the only person she could trust was Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said immediately, "I'll take care of them." When she first came looking for a job, Kyla saved her from despair by letting her work in the restaurant despite having been in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she wanted to repay Kyla for her kindness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Mrs. Corbyn and Nelson were also very kind to her, especially Nelson. He had clung to her when he first saw her, and she really liked Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla finally smiled with relief. "Grace, thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I hope that if you really get in trouble, you would come to me too and not suffer all by yourself," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it. If I really... Can't take it, I'll come to you." However, she knew in her heart that if one day she really could not take Martin Weiss's revenge, then it would be useless to find Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Grace had Jason backing her up and even if Jason ruled Emerald City, Martin Weiss... Was definitely no slouch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been with Martin Weiss for years and knew this man all too well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was cruel enough, heartless enough, and cold enough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had once tried to warm his heart with her sincerity. She thought that constant effort brought success and that perseverance would prevail, but in the end, she was only deceiving herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she ran into Martin Weiss at the mall, she had been on edge these days, feeling as if something was going to happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe... Some things would still happen no matter how she hid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the calm Kyla right now, Grace could only feel a heavy weight on her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After coming out of the small restaurant, Grace was about to get in the car and return to Reed Residence when a voice suddenly rang behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, can you give me a minute?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened. This voice&hellip; Had once been so familiar to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The voice once said, "Grace, you're the only woman I want to marry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The voice also said, "Grace, I'll make you happy. Even if my family opposes it, I&rsquo;ve decided that you're the one I want to spend my life with."</p></div>
