        <h1>Chapter 4086</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, on the occasion of Hunter's ancestor's wedding, that woman suddenly appeared at the wedding and pointed at Hunter's ancestor and the bride, saying, "I curse your descendants, who will never have a good ending, who will welcome death in pain, and who will become monsters feared by all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The woman was later driven away by Hunter's people, and her so-called curse was not taken seriously at the time, as everyone thought it was just the ramblings of a crazy woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But later on, when strange things began to happen one after another to Hunter's people, no one thought it was just ramblings anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was...a poisonous curse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That woman was a bug master who used insect breeding to cast spells.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Afterwards, Hunter spent a long time searching for a way to break the curse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the generations passed, Hunter's wealth accumulated more and more, but his direct descendants became fewer and fewer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, when it was almost too late, he found a way to break the curse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And this church was built at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every year during Qingming and Winter Solstice, a worship service is held in this church.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the church, an old man stands in front of a portrait.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The portrait is of a woman in ancient costume, bright and beautiful, and it is the portrait of the woman who cursed Hunter all those years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A woman like this can love someone to the bone, but when she hates someone, she can be viciously poisonous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're back," Mr. Hunter turned around and looked at Chandler standing behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Chandler replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How's your health been during this time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's still the same, although I occasionally have some painful episodes, I can still bear it," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The medicinal bath is ready. After Tina graduates, you and she should get married as soon as possible and have a child soon. You should know that only the child you have with her can save you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler lowered his eyes slightly, "I understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, you may go now," Mr. Hunter said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tone was formal, like that of a superior and subordinate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And for this type of conversation, Chandler was already quite familiar with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Hunter, it seemed that everyone wore a restrained mask. The so-called family affection and warmth seemed to be nonexistent in Hunter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or perhaps it should be said that even if there was family affection in Hunter, it was faint, as if everything done was just for the continuation of the family's bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he was just a tool for continuing the bloodline.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After leaving the church, Chandler came to the medicinal bath pool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The servants had already arranged everything inside the room, and as soon as he entered, there was a strong smell of medicinal herbs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler looked at the blood-like pool with a heavy gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was all too familiar with this scent, having had to soak in this type of medicinal bath every so often since he was young.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only this type of medicinal bath could calm the poison in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, poison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The woman who poisoned Hunter used a special kind of poison that can be passed down through bloodlines to future generations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It could be passed down to the next generation or even several generations later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only known treatment is a medicinal bath, but it only treats the symptoms and not the root cause.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To truly cure the poison, a specific person needs to have a child with someone who has the poison in their bloodline. The placenta of the child born from this union has the power to cure the poison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The placenta needs to be processed into medicine and ingested to truly cure the poison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, anyone in the Hunter family who has inherited this poison will go to great lengths to find the specific person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those in the Hunter family who have the poison in their blood will have a special connection to the specific person.</p></div>
