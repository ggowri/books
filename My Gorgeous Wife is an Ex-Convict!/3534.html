        <h1>Chapter 3532</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William, this child, grew up watching Jasper. Although his biological mother was Lily, the person who framed Grace back then, this child has good talent and learns things quickly. More importantly, he really cares about Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After so many years, this care seems to have been increasing with the passage of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, since we both hope that Jasper can be happy, you also have to promise me that you won't mention this matter to anyone, especially Jasper, until we really find Lawrence and investigate his situation," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand," William replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he had a feeling that sooner or later, Lawrence would appear in front of him and Jasper. And when that day comes, it will probably be a stormy one!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's been three days since school started, but Mason hasn't shown up for class. Veronica felt a pang of sadness as she looked at the empty seat next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since the day she learned about hypnosis from Mason, she has been researching a lot of information about it. She even consulted doctors about whether hypnosis can be reversed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had planned to wait until school started to talk to Mason, but now she can't even see him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Veronica suddenly heard a classmate say to her, "Veronica, why is Mason transferring? Are you transferring with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Transfer?" Veronica was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't you know?" The other person was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's face showed a hint of embarrassment, as many people in the class still didn't know what had happened between her and Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did you know he was transferring?" Veronica asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I passed by the principal's office earlier and overheard someone say that Jasper came today to handle his withdrawal procedures..." Before the other person could finish their sentence, Veronica had already stood up abruptly and rushed out of the classroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is Mason currently at school?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to find him, even though she knew that the current her was no longer Veronica, no longer the person he cared about, but she still couldn't give up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to see him again, to ask him if he could really forget the feelings they once had together so easily, or even... did he not want to find them again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica ran all the way to the principal's office and pushed open the door abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound of the door opening startled the people inside, and suddenly everyone's gaze turned towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And among them, there was Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica gasped for breath as she looked at Mason, who was sitting on a chair not far away, holding a pen in his hand and a document in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica hurried over and saw that it was a transfer notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you transferring?" she asked Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people around them didn't stop Veronica from approaching, as the teachers at school were aware of Veronica's relationship with Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm, I'm transferring schools," Mason said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lifted his eyelashes and looked at her. "No reason, just no need to stay here anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt a sudden pang. He had only enrolled in this high school because of her. If it weren't for her, he could have gone to a better one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now that his feelings for her were gone, there was no reason for him to stay here, was there?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just thinking about these things made Veronica feel a tightness in her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suddenly grabbed Mason's wrist and said, "I need to talk to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't resist and let her lead him out of the office.</p></div>
