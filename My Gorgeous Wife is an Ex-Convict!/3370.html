        <h1>Chapter 3368</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lonny is saying this right now to both assert his dominance and to strengthen his relationship with the other person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As expected, upon hearing these words, the staff's expression immediately changed. They turned to Chandler and Tina and said, "I'm sorry, but this set of stamps has already been reserved by another customer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could Chandler not see that the so-called pre-order was just a cover-up? "When I asked for this set of stamps before, I never heard you say it was a pre-order."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's something we forgot to mention, sorry," said the staff member.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Laura looked smugly at Tina and even lifted her chin, which made Tina so angry that her cheeks puffed up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lonny watched Chandler and Tina calmly. The Stephenson family's White Maple Group has many businesses that often overlap with Mond Group. The two companies frequently compete for business in the entire industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Simply put, most of White Maple Group's business was not in Emerald City before. Therefore, even though there were some conflicts, they were not too severe. However, in recent years, White Maple Group has shifted many of its businesses to Emerald City, making the competition with Mond Group even more intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The master is aware of the tension between Laura and Tina, but has never considered resolving it. He intends to let it be and not interfere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, Laura wants to compete for the seal. Although it's just a small thing, getting it would make Laura happy and put pressure on the Stephenson family. Surely, the master would also approve!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However...the Mond family has never been able to figure out the background of the young man beside Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Mond family sees the Stephenson family as their competitors and they have naturally gathered information about the people and events related to the Stephenson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Lonny knows that the boy in front of him is named Chandler and has a close relationship with the Stephenson family. He has been with the Stephenson family since Tina was born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Chandler and Tina are very close. He even heard a rumor that Tina is Chandler's stepdaughter, but he doesn't know if it's true or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But thinking about a family like the Stephenson family, would they really give away their only treasure to be someone else's child bride? It seems highly unlikely!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The staff is now packing up the seal to give to Laura.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Tina was angry, she could only reluctantly accept it. She hung her head low, like a defeated little animal, and pulled Chandler away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler glanced at Tina and then looked up at Lonny. "So, if it's pre-booked, it's all good, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course!" Lonny replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler said to the staff, "So, can you ask your Vice President Gary to come over and clarify whether this set of stamps has been reserved or not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the staff heard this, they were immediately overwhelmed. Bring Vice President Gary over? Who is this boy to summon Vice President Gary with just one word?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Lonny was taken aback for a moment, but then couldn't help but burst out laughing, his eyes full of mockery. "Young man, you really don't know your place!" he said, and then prepared to take the seal handed to him by the staff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait a minute," said Chandler. "I said, let's wait for Vice President Gary to come over and tell us whether this box of seals has been reserved or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Joke, do you think just because you said Vice President Gary will come, he will actually come?" Lonny scolded, reaching out to grab the stamp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the next moment, a stranger suddenly appeared and directly stopped Lonny's hand.</p></div>
