        <h1>Chapter 659</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian kept asking himself, 'What am I looking at? Isn't it clear that Stella Lindsay is the one I&rsquo;ve been looking for?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person who saved his life was Stella, and his investigation showed that Stella had led a miserable life these years. What he needed to do was to treat Stella as well as he could and let Stella live a good life in return for saving his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after finding Stella, he felt empty as if he had lost something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you looking at, Brian?" Stella Lindsay's voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned his head to look at Stella Lindsay who was walking this way. Then, he walked up to her and said, "Nothing, I'm going home. You can call me if anything comes up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going home now?" Stella Lindsay was obviously reluctant. "It's late now. Why don't you spend the night here and leave tomorrow? There are rooms available here for you to rest in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. I have urgent business in the office tomorrow, so I'd better go back," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay could not say anything, so she simply agreed when he said so. Then, she and Brian walked to where he parked his car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian... Well, my ex-husband told me that he's going back on the divorce agreement. If we want him to sign it, we&rsquo;ll have to give him another ten million dollars," said Stella Lindsay. Technically speaking, although she told everyone that she was divorced, she was not legally divorced yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you really think it's miserable to be married to him, then I'll help you. You don't have to worry about the divorce. He'll agree to the divorce when the trial begins in a couple of days," Brian said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay was reassured, and she looked at Brian with admiration. It was as if all the problems were nothing to the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only such a man was her prince!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she was going to muddle through for the rest of her life. However, the crown prince of the entertainment industry unexpectedly appeared in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had read gossip about him when she surfed the internet, and she thought a man like him could only be seen from a distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unexpectedly, he was now so close at hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to divorce him," Stella Lindsay said firmly. Only a divorce would allow her to be with him openly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well then, I'll have him sign it. Besides, you told me you want to study at a university in Emerald City. I've already helped you apply to the university. After your grandmother's funeral, I'll send someone to fetch you to Emerald City. It's up to you whether you want to live in the university dormitory or buy a house and live alone," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay was delighted. After all, her educational background was a disgrace to her. Therefore, she could not wait to improve her education so that she would be worthy of being with him in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're so nice to me, Brian!" Stella Lindsay gave him a sweet smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at her smile but felt nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought he would be happy to find the little girl and that her smile was all he wanted to see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was no sense of joy, only a sense of disappointment which he could not even figure out himself. Even now, the smile on her face made him feel strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's wrong with me? This is obviously what I asked for!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You saved my life, so of course, I'm nice to you," answered Brian.</p></div>
