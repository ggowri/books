        <h1>Chapter 2679</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack frowned. It was... Raymond Bowman. It was said that they went to university together. Besides that, Raymond Bowman was also one of the film's investors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman rushed to Valda Theller's side and said, "Forget about this scene. I'll talk to the director." He rushed over after hearing she was forced to be a stand-in for a scene with beatings and abuse at the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's pointless even if you do that," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How do you know it's pointless if I don't try?" Raymond Bowman asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "Because tMason Swansonrcumstances won't allow it. Queenie Mack is the one who forced me to do it. The director and producer dare not offend Queenie Mack." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or rather, they dare not offend Queenie Mack's backer.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had no idea who Queenie Mack's backer was. She only saw from online gossip that Queenie Mack had good resources because she had a powerful backer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The film was also a stepping stone for Queenie Mack. It was said that there was a drama where she could be the female lead waiting for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After thinking for a moment, Raymond Bowman said, "Wait for me!" Then, he left in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, someone stopped Raymond Bowman when he was about to reach the director.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Barbara Schuman, get out of the way!" Raymond Bowman snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman said, "I'm trying to help you. Are you going to the director and ask him to call off Valda Theller's stand-in scene?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what if I am?" Raymond Bowman asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then your efforts will only be in vain. Not only that, but you&rsquo;ll also offend Queenie Mack," said Barbara Schuman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman ignored her and went straight to the director.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Queenie Mack's backer is the Weiss family!" Barbara Schuman said meaningfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Weiss family? Which one?" Raymond Bowman stopped and looked at Barbara Schuman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Weiss family of Emerald City. The Weiss family is considered one of the top families in Emerald City. Do you think it's worth it to offend the Weiss family for Valda Theller? Besides, even if you're an investor, you're only 'one' of them. The director and producer won't risk offending the Weiss family for you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman approached Raymond Bowman and said in a voice only audible to each other, "Valda Theller is just acting as a double. It's just a scene that&rsquo;ll be over soon. But your future will be greatly affected if you offend the Weiss family, won't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, they heard a crew member shouting at Valda Theller and those extras to take their positions. The camera crew was ready and about to start filming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at the camera and smiled bitterly. 'What am I expecting? Did I really think something would happen because Raymond Bowman asked me to wait for him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nothing would happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stood in a dark corner and took a deep breath to clear her mind. 'Don't overthink it. It's just acting! It's all just acting!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the sound of &lsquo;action&rsquo;, her body was suddenly pulled into the bushes. She struggled according to the script.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda Theller soon sensed that something was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was fake when they were rehearsing, but now... those extras... were not faking it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The punches came down on her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop it... Stop..." she shouted, but the camera continued filing and no one approached. Everyone thought it was just an act.</p></div>
