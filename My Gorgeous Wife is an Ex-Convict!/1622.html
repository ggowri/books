        <h1>Chapter 1620</h1>
        <div><p>Hadwin Stephenson&#x27;s figure suddenly flashed through Lina&#x27;s mind.</p><p>She shook her head hard. &#x27;What&#x27;s wrong with me? Why am I thinking of Hadwin Stephenson when I’m supposed to get over him?!&#x27;</p><p>When the two chose their cakes and returned to Grace and Jason&#x27;s table, Lina saw that her best friend was blushing slightly. Jason was feeding her cake one bite at a time.</p><p>This public display of affection is...&#x27; However, Lina was glad to see her best friend so happy now. Even if she could never have a perfect romance herself, it was good enough that Grace could have a happy ending.</p><p>During their chat, Lina learned that her best friend planned to start a law firm in Emerald City and immediately showed her support. &quot;I&#x27;ll be there to support you when you open for business.&quot;</p><p>Grace smiled and replied, &quot;Okay. Mr. <span style="color:#222222"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="background-color:#ffffff">Sherman</span></span></span>, you can come as well if you’re free.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure,&quot; answered Anthony Sherman.</p><p>During their conversation, Grace learned that Anthony Sherman held a middle management position in a big enterprise. Being able to be a part of middle management in a big company at his age meant he had certain capabilities.</p><p>Jason did not talk much. He just kept on feeding Grace cake, making her feel so embarrassed!</p><p>After finishing the cake, Grace bought two more slices for her children when she picked them up later.</p><p>The four of them walked out of the cake shop. Just then, a voice suddenly shouted, &quot;Here! That damn lawyer is right here!&quot;</p><p>The next moment, several people rushed toward Grace. Before Grace could react, something was already coming their way.</p><p>Grace found herself in a warm embrace and heard the familiar voice. &quot;Grace, don&#x27;t be afraid!&quot;</p><p>Lina and Anthony Sherman looked dumbfounded. They watched as those people hit the couple with broken eggs and rotten vegetables, as well as fistfuls of joss paper. </p><p>Anthony Sherman reacted before Lina. He was about to pull Lina away but another figure was faster than him. They pulled Lina behind their back while they let themselves get hit by those filthy things.</p><p>It was... Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p>Anthony Sherman was surprised to see the man who showed up so suddenly. How could it be such a coincidence that Hadwin Stephenson would show up at this time? Maybe...</p><p>Just then, the crowd that rushed over was subdued by several men. One of them came over to Jason and said, &quot;Young master Reed! Are you okay? All the troublemakers have been subdued.&quot;</p><p>Only then did Jason slowly release his tight grip on Grace.</p><p>It was now when Grace saw the messy state the man in front of her was in.</p><p>His body and hair were covered with those filthy things and joss paper. His face was dripping with eggs.</p><p>Compared to him, she was doing much better.</p><p>&quot;Jay, are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?&quot; Grace asked nervously, her voice shaking.</p><p>He had held her in his arms. No matter how she shouted at him to let go of her and not shield her with himself, his hands would not let go of her.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m fine. They just hit me with some small things,&quot; Jason said nonchalantly.</p><p>Grace breathed a sigh of relief after confirming that Jason was indeed unharmed, but her heart still trembled.</p></div>
