        <h1>Chapter 913</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. 'Booked?' In Emerald City, even if those rich and powerful families wanted to book such a top restaurant, the restaurant would not agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only a handful of people in Emerald City could actually do that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not understand why Jason would go to the trouble of booking the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she followed Terrence to the third floor, there was only one table left in the large hall. Jason was sitting on one side of the table, looking through the menu in his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he heard footsteps, he raised his head and looked in Grace's direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark eyes shone brightly while his thin lips smiled brightly. This image of him seemed to imprint deeply into one&rsquo;s heart, making it unforgettable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is that what they meant by an eternity in one glance?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then took a deep breath and walked over to Jason. "Here I am. I&rsquo;d like you to help me save Kyla and Nelson from Martin Weiss. Is that alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason gently smiled. "Sit down first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pursed her lips as Terrence helped Grace pull out her chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hesitated but sat down anyway. Then, Jason handed her the menu and said, "Take a look and see if there's anything you&rsquo;d like."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't come here to eat!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm here to eat though." He nonchalantly looked at her and said, "Do you remember what I told you before? I said I would treat you to a nice dinner if I made money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened. That was... That was a long time ago. It was when they lived in that little rental house. Back then, he had called her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; and she had a family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just don't know if you approve of the venue?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew she had to finish the meal if she wanted to talk to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can order whatever you like. I've never been here before, so I don't know what's good," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright." Jason nodded and turned to the restaurant manager standing nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, the restaurant manager and Terrence left. Then, Jason seemed to say nonchalantly, "Do you want to help Kyla that much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes.&rdquo; She gave an affirmative answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla isn't Lina. Is she worth it?" he continued asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." It was because Kyla had helped her when she was in trouble! Maybe it was hard for someone like him to realize how important it was for someone to give you a hand and help you out when you thought you were alone and helpless!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pursed his thin lips as he had already expected her to say that. Even after she begged him to help her find Kyla, everything was under his control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more she cared about Kyla, the better it would be for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he heard her answer, he felt uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Lina is important to her, and now Kyla too. Even... the little boy is important!'</p></div>
