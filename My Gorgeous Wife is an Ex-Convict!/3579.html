        <h1>Chapter 3577</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, Mabel became even angrier and vented her anger on the small assistant in front of her. However, in this situation, she naturally couldn't take action herself. So she immediately gave a signal, and the people around her understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, a waiter came with a tray full of food. However, when the waiter approached the small assistant, it seemed as if he accidentally slipped and all the food on the tray spilled all over the assistant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems that you, as an assistant, really attract trouble. You always seem to get in people's way," Mabel said. "Maybe someone intentionally instructed her to get in the way, and the person behind her can be easily guessed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What did you say?" Angelica's face changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, who knows what tomorrow's news will bring? Will we see Assistant Angelica getting hit and ruining a million-dollar dress, with some unknown conspiracy behind it?" Mabel sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as we bribe the reporters, they can write the news however we want!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two actresses were clearly using this assistant as a pawn in their feud. Even Jasper, who was standing nearby, frowned and felt uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wasn't someone who liked to meddle in other people's business, but at this moment, she lifted her foot and walked towards the assistant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William, who was standing next to her, followed suit when he saw what was happening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two female stars who were previously bickering, as well as the people around them, also noticed Jasper and William approaching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They naturally recognized the two as the eldest princess of the Reed family and the son of the Barlow family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So the two female stars quickly stopped their argument and put on a smiling face to greet Jasper and William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Reed, Mr. Barlow, what a coincidence that you are also attending this charity event, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've been wanting to meet you two for a long time. Would it be possible to have the honor of making friends?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Jasper completely ignored the two people and only looked at his disheveled assistant in shock, blurting out, "Veronica!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was originally looking down and tidying up her messy clothes. When she heard Jasper's voice, she looked up and a wolfish smile flashed across her face. "Jasper."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll have someone bring you some clothes right away. For now, let's find a place to clean up." Jasper said as he hurriedly brushed off the food and pastries that had fallen on Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I can do it myself. I don't want to dirty your clothes." Veronica quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Jasper didn't seem to care about getting his clothes dirty and kept apologizing, "Sorry, Veronica, I should have stood up earlier!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that way, Veronica could have been spared some humiliation!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, Jasper took Veronica's hand and led her towards the VIP lounge prepared by the charity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two female stars were stunned, wondering what was going on... Did this little assistant actually know the esteemed princess of the Reed family?</p></div>
