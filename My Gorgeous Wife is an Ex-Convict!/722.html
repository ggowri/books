        <h1>Chapter 721</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you trying to avoid Martin Weiss?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, if the case was to be reversed, she would probably have to meet Martin Weiss again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can't take the risk. I can't let him know of Nelson's existence. If he finds out, even if it's a one in a million chance that... He wants Nelson, I'll go crazy. Grace, Nelson is my life!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Grace could understand Kyla's feelings for Nelson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she had never been a mother, she thought that if she was in the same position as Kyla now, she might have made the same choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was better to keep the child than to clear their name!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I saw Martin Weiss again yesterday," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes immediately widened as she looked at Grace in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was at a trade fair. Martin Weiss remembered Nelson and wanted to see him again," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's body could not help but tremble. 'He... Wants to see Nelson again? The baby he said he wouldn't want if I got pregnant&hellip; He wants to see him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How ironic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, you listen to me well. You're not even qualified to bear my child. If you&rsquo;re really pregnant, then this child wouldn't have the life to be given birth by you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Both his cruel words and his handsome face were indifferent and contemptuous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words were like a sharp sword, cutting her self-esteem, pride, and love to pieces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you..." Kyla, with a pale face and quivering lips, looked at Grace with great tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't agree with it. I said Nelson and his family don't like to be disturbed, so I refused his request," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, the fair will be held in Emerald City for three days, Kyla. Perhaps Martin Weiss will remain in Emerald City these days. If you really want to avoid him, be careful these days and try not to go out." Grace reminded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla nodded. "Got it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She escaped the last time Martin Weiss came to Emerald City. Could she be so lucky this time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Mrs. Corbyn came back from the park with Nelson, Kyla looked at her son's young face with a restless heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She kept feeling like something was going to happen and destroy the quiet life she finally managed to have.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... She took a deep breath and picked her son up. "Nelson, whatever happens, Mommy is going to be with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter what, she could not lose Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the small restaurant, Grace hesitated before taking out a sticky note with a name and a string of numbers from her bag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she took out her phone and dialed the number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment or two, someone picked it up at the other end. "Who is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is this Dr. Leng? I was introduced by Dr. Guzman and I&rsquo;d like you to help me study my situation to see if hypnosis is necessary," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been hesitating, but yesterday, there was a risk that her headache and the disorderly images in her mind would lead to a misunderstanding.</p></div>
