        <h1>Chapter 2037</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," replied Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the Sweeney family's living room, Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney looked at the exquisite letter Hadwin Stephenson's subordinate had brought over. After opening it, they could only see a list inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The contents on the list stunned the two honest and ordinary citizens, Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The bride price was hundreds of millions of dollars, and there were all sorts of gold items, mansions...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What are these?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"They're the betrothal gifts Mr. Stephenson prepared. If there's anything else you'd like to add, feel free to tell us," they said respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Add?" Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney looked at each other. There were already so many things that they had nothing to add!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There were so many that they were at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day, Grace accompanied Kyla and Nelson to the hospital to collect the hearing aid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">While Nelson was putting on and adjusting the hearing aid, Grace saw that Kyla was a little distracted as they waited outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, what's the matter? Are you worried about Nelson's hearing aid?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Huh?" Kyla came to her senses, shook her head, and said, "No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then what are you worried about? You look worried," asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla touched her cheek, smiled sadly, and said, "Nothing, it's just Paisley Daniels is out of prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She's out of prison?" Grace froze. Then, she remembered that yesterday was the day Paisley Daniels was released from prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With the pressure from the Weiss family, Paisley Daniels did not get a sentence reduction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, she got out on the same date as what was initially sentenced to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why don't I send someone to protect you and Nelson?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks." Kyla smiled. "Many years have passed, and the Kong family is no longer as glamorous as they used to be. Even if Paisley Daniels hates me, she might not be able to do anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, a voice suddenly rang beside them. "Grace, Kyla, it&rsquo;s... It's you guys."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They looked up in the direction of the voice as it was familiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was Chase, Chase Harper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze. She did not expect to run into Chase here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The once shy and honest man now looked older than his actual age. He was dressed in casual clothes and had some faint gray hair at the temples. He was also holding a cute little girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Chase, it's been so long since we last met," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "Chase, what a coincidence. This child is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh, this is my daughter. She's three," said Chase Harper before turning to the little girl beside him and saying, "Juliet, this is aunt Cummins and aunt Corbyn. Say hello to them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
