        <h1>Chapter 3236</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" Martin met her gaze and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just feel like what you did earlier isn't something you would normally do," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, coming to watch a movie today isn't something I would normally do either, right?" Martin replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the movie's start time approached, the two checked their tickets and walked into the theater.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the dim environment, Kyla watched the movie and felt an unusual sense of calm. The two of them could sit quietly and watch the movie like this, which was really nice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It reminded her of the early days of their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The time they wasted between them could not be regained, but what about this feeling? Could it be regained?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A complete feeling, whether it's love or hate, should at least be complete, not incomplete and forgotten!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a month's time, they would be taking wedding photos, and after the shoot, she would choose to break his hypnosis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wants him to regain the forgotten feelings. If he had chosen to leave her at that time, she would have done everything possible to win him back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Valda said, be thick-skinned and don't give up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps they both loved each other at the beginning, but they gave up too easily, which led to one mistake after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The movie was still playing, and Martin and Kyla's hands were still holding each other tightly...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's recent source of happiness is learning to play the piano with Lawrence. Their teacher is also fond of Lawrence and constantly praises his high aptitude and natural talent for playing the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever Lawrence receives praise, his face turns red like a red apple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And every time this happens, Jasper can't help but raise his hand and touch the other person's cheek to confirm if they are really blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her opinion, Lawrence blushes easily, which is really amusing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And when she touched him like that, it actually made him blush even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Lawrence felt embarrassed, he didn't stop Jasper's actions. In fact, when her hand touched his cheek, he felt a flutter in his heart that he couldn't explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, do you...do you like touching other people's faces?" Lawrence asked hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," she shook her head, "I just like touching your face because you're cute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although children at this age have a strong sense of gender, Jasper's awareness in this area is still relatively naive due to her twin brothers being male and her relationship with William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, William is very cute and I like him too," Jasper added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William?" Lawrence was surprised. This was the first time he had heard the name "William" from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, he's my best friend. I visit Deer Capital every summer and winter break, and William comes to Emerald City too," Jasper explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The words "best friend" stirred a sour feeling in Lawrence's heart that he couldn't explain.</p></div>
