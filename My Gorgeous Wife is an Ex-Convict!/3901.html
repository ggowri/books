        <h1>Chapter 3899</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Mick and his group came to toast, they didn't toast everyone at the table. They only toasted the one with the deepest background at the table, and then raised their glasses to the others at the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In just two or three minutes, they were done with the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching Mick and his group walk towards another table, Clarissa couldn't help muttering, "What kind of toast is this? It's so short."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had been daydreaming about drinking with Mick, but her dream was shattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lower your voice!" Francis quickly whispered to his daughter, afraid that her words would be heard by others and cause criticism.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't say anything wrong," Clarissa muttered, "Isn't it customary to toast each person at the table?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't forget who they are," Francis said. If it weren't for their business dealings with the Reed family's company, they wouldn't have been invited to this wedding. "Besides, if they really toasted each person at the table, with so many people at the wedding, when would they finish?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I..." Clarissa bit her lip and looked towards Mick again, the words stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But how could Francis, as a father, not see through his daughter's thoughts? "Don't be too proud, my dear. Some people are just for looking, not for getting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's face suddenly turned red. Her father's words seemed to have seen through all her thoughts, making her feel embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Can I only look at it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa lowered her eyes, her gaze flickering. So what if she had a high status? It didn't mean that Mick couldn't be interested in her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, she could feel that when Mick came to their table, his gaze lingered on her for a while!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So maybe Mick was also interested in her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Clarissa felt secretly dissatisfied. She felt that her father underestimated her. Why couldn't she get a man like Mick?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as she could seize the opportunity, she would naturally have a chance to get such a man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the toast, Mick could finally take a break.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the best man, he was deeply exhausted at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If his own wedding was going to be this tiring in the future, he would rather keep it simple!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this thought passed through his mind and he laughed at himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was he thinking! He was actually thinking about his future wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the future... would he have a wedding? Would he even have a woman he wanted to spend his life with?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had a younger brother and sister. Mason was already married, and Jasper and William had good relationships. Even if he remained unmarried for his whole life, there would still be someone to inherit everything from the Reed family. He didn't have to worry about being forced into marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, given the family's atmosphere, even if he really had no interest in women for his whole life, his parents wouldn't force him to do anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But inexplicably, at this moment, Nancy's face flashed through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a figure stumbled towards him and collided with him. When he caught a glimpse of the figure from the corner of his eye and tried to avoid it, he only managed to dodge the person's body, but not the drink in their hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, some of the drink spilled onto Mick's suit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The black suit didn't show the drink stains too much, but the white shirt underneath now had a light yellow stain because of the drink.</p></div>
