        <h1>Chapter 2349</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman had always been so humble for others. Had she ever lived well for herself?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he felt no pleasure in her humble pleasing. Instead, he was angry and in pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The baby you're carrying isn't just yours. The baby is mine too. I'll save them at all costs!" Martin Weiss said grimly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Chairman Weiss, we just ran a red light and the police are now coming after us," said Mallory Malcom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Keep driving!" said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla suddenly felt something on the back of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After freezing for a moment, she realized that it was Martin Weiss's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand was now wrapped around hers. "The baby will be alright. I promise!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked blankly at Martin Weiss. She knew nothing was absolute in this world, but his words were reassuring to her. It was as if their baby... would really be safe now that he had given his word!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car stopped at the hospital&rsquo;s entrance, Martin Weiss picked up Kyla and got out while telling Mallory Malcom, "Explain the situation to the police." With that said, he hurried to the emergency room with Kyla in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Soon, the doctor and nurse quickly examined Kyla. They inquired about her medical history.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was going to tell them about it while enduring the pain, but Martin Weiss, who followed her into the emergency room, beat her to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He told them how far along she was in her pregnancy, her medical history, the last pregnancy check-up she went for... in detail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was surprised, not expecting Martin Weiss to remember everything so clearly. He even... knew the results from her latest pregnancy check-up after they separated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, had he been privy to her pregnancy check-ups the whole time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How are you related to the patient?" the doctor asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm her husband," said Martin Weiss. He spoke so matter-of-factly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor arranged for Kyla to be given oxygen before going for an ultrasound scan!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla was pushed into the ultrasound room, she heard the nurse say, "Your husband is so attentive. He remembers all the results from your pregnancy check-ups. There aren't many husbands like that nowadays. Many husbands don't even know how many weeks pregnant their wives are. Your husband must love you very much. Your baby will be safe with loving parents like you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Will the baby be safe?' Kyla hoped what the nurse said was true!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Martin Weiss... loved me. Yeah, he used to love me, but he doesn't love me anymore.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a thorough examination, the doctor kept Kyla on oxygen for half an hour and gave her two injections. Kyla finally felt the baby stop kicking, and her belly stopped hurting so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was relieved to know that the child was stable and not in any immediate danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But what on earth is going on?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It probably has something to do with your liver transplant. Pregnancy is too much for your liver right now. Your doctor must have mentioned it, right? The pain will increase as you're further along."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor's statement made Kyla's heart sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, the doctor who treated her at Municipal Women's Hospital had warned her that her body could only take it until her baby was seven months old.</p></div>
