        <h1>Chapter 2549</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Gregory? Mr. Gregory?" The two doctors at his side immediately shouted after seeing George Gregory's stunned appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory let out a breath with difficulty and stared at Dr. Larson with his dark eyes. "Can you guarantee that your test result shows that Simon is really Amber Mitchell's child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Larson said sternly, "Of course, I can guarantee it. I even tested it several times for fear of getting it wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory took a deep breath. "Alright. I hope you'll keep it between us for now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course," the attending doctor and Dr. Larson quickly promised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory then dashed out of the hospital and drove in the direction of the prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Louise Mitchell's the one who can give me an answer now! How did Louise Mitchell do it? She took Amber Mitchell's child as her own.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would not have married Louise Mitchell had it not been for the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he married Louise Mitchell, only to find out that she was not the child's biological mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so ironic he found it ridiculous! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He rushed to the prison. After half an hour, George Gregory finally met Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Louise Mitchell saw George Gregory, she immediately snapped. "George Gregory, what are you doing here? You&rsquo;ve never thought of me as your wife. Are you just gonna let me get a life sentence? Do you want Simon to have a criminal mother? He&rsquo;ll never be able to hold his head up!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her words seemed to trigger George Gregory. He stared intently at Louise Mitchell and asked through clenched teeth, "Whose child is Simon's?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell froze before shouting, "Simon's your child. The Gregory family did the DNA test yourself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm asking you whose child Simon is!" George Gregory's voice grew louder. His dark and deep eyes were bloody and fierce when they stared at Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's heart seemed to miss a beat at this instant. She seemed to be intimidated by George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fear ran through her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did he... find out something?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, no. There's no way he found out. He spent so many years in the dark. How could he have found out about it now? Besides, even Amber Mitchell doesn&rsquo;t know about it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Amber Mitchell thinks her baby died during childbirth!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the short moment of hesitation in Louise Mitchell's eyes made George Gregory understand that the woman in front of him knew full well what he was asking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, you knew that Simon is Amber Mitchell's child, but you deliberately pretended to be his mother just to marry into the Gregory family?" George Gregory asked sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A look of confusion appeared on Amber Mitchell's face as she tried to suppress the shock in her heart. "I... I don't know what you&rsquo;re talking about. Simon's my child. What does he have to do with Amber Mitchell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your child?" George Gregory sneered. "Simon isn't related to you at all. Amber Mitchell's the one related to him by DNA! Do you want me to slap the DNA report in your face before you admit it?"</p></div>
