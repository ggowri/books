        <h1>Chapter 791</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was struggling with hunger, he was probably eating all sorts of delicacies while he held his beloved woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you let go? I think we've said everything we needed to say in court. I went to prison just like how you wanted me to. Do you have anything else to teach me, Mr. Weiss?" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss could not help narrowing his eyes. The woman in front of him was not as gentle as before. Instead, she seemed to have prickles all over her to keep people away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, the words &lsquo;let go&rsquo; from her mouth struck him harshly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, do you think that after a few years in prison, you&rsquo;ve paid all that you owe?" Martin Weiss said coldly. His long fingers squeezed her arm a little tighter, bringing her closer to him. "You're really naive if you think so!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla suddenly laughed. 'Naive... He said that I'm naive!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had destroyed her innocence completely!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, I never owed you anything." She raised her chin and for once, did not escape his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter if she was a small woman in dire straits and no matter how embarrassed she was, she owed him nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't owe me anything?" He laughed angrily. "You owe me a life! If it wasn't for you, how would Zoen have lost the baby in her belly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she laughed even louder until tears came to her eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Didn't I go to jail for this? He testified that I pushed Paisley Daniels down the stairs, causing her to have the miscarriage and lose her child.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was sentenced to three years and six months in prison for wounding with intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Three and a half years in prison and he still said that she owed him a life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, how many years do you want me to stay in prison for? Five years? Ten years? Or 20 years... Or life imprisonment?" Kyla said to him sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face darkened. "Enough!" He did not like her laughter and sarcasm. It was as if he was the one in the wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, this was no place for conversation, and there was something about her he wanted to find out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of this, Martin Weiss led Kyla to a car not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla immediately struggled. "Martin Weiss, let go! What are you trying to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't let go!" he said coldly. All her struggling seemed so useless to him. "Kyla, it took me a long time to find you. Tell me, do you think I&rsquo;ll let go of you so easily?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt a pang in her heart, and her eyes fell on his handsome profile. It was so cold and heartless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she was somewhat flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What kind of price does this man want me to pay again? Can I really take Nelson and escape from this man safely?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was taken by Martin Weiss to his hotel room in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the top presidential suite in Emerald City. If it was in the past, she might not even be qualified to enter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was calm now and no longer struggled as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that he had found her, her resistance would have been no more than throwing an egg against a rock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If he feels that his revenge was not enough and would like to continue with his revenge, then I&rsquo;ll just endure it. However, no matter what, I mustn't let him find out about Nelson's existence. I mustn't let him take Nelson away from me!'</p></div>
