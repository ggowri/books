        <h1>Chapter 3896</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy watched Mick's back and lowered her eyes gently after a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was a boy from a completely different world than hers, a true prodigy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Clarissa Schultz, who had no blood relation to him and was arrogant and domineering, would always talk about this prodigy from the Reed family with a face full of admiration and infatuation, praising his talent, good looks, and strong family background.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially for this wedding, Clarissa attached great importance to leaving a good impression on Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... it was ridiculous that Mick didn't even know who Clarissa was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she was slapped by Clarissa and saw Mick, it was impossible not to be shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for why she didn't ask for Mick's help when she was being hit, it was just a result of weighing the pros and cons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she had called for Mick at that time, it would only have made Clarissa more embarrassed. Then, when they returned to the Schultz family after the wedding, Clarissa would have vented her anger on her and her mother even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't mind, but her mother...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of her mother's compromises in the Schultz family, Nancy felt a pain in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that her mother's many sacrifices in the Schultz family were mostly for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she doesn't have the ability to protect her mother right now, so all she can do is endure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I really wish I could grow up quickly so that I can protect my mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick returned to the wedding venue, and the wedding was about to begin soon. William walked up to him and asked, "Where did you go just now? I was about to call you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just wandered around." Mick replied casually, glancing at the wedding venue. His eyes showed a hint of surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not far away, a girl was staring straight at him. She was wearing the same clothes as the girl who hit him in the courtyard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So this girl is the one who slapped him earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The middle-aged man and woman standing next to the girl must be her parents, or should he say... her stepmother and father?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's gaze fell on the face of the middle-aged woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked a bit like Nancy, especially her eyes. However, this woman had a gentle feeling, while Nancy's face was stubborn and cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was surprised that he could remember the name of the girl he met earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, he only heard the name once from the girl who hit him, but he remembered it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in school, he couldn't even remember the names of many girls in his class.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Clarissa saw Mick's gaze turn towards her, she couldn't help but feel happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is he looking at her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Clarissa's face turned slightly red, and her smile became even brighter. She wanted to present her best side to the other person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was the school's beauty, and many boys pursued her, but she didn't like any of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only someone like Mick, who had a perfect appearance and family background, could make her heart beat. If she could really develop a relationship with someone like Mick, and even marry into the Reed family in the future if she was lucky...</p></div>
