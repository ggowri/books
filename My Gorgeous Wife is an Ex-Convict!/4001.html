        <h1>Chapter 3999</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If those self-talk recordings that Nancy had recorded with a listening device were really exposed... the Schultz family might take advantage of it to appeal Clarissa's case again, and... what worried her the most was that it might have a negative impact on Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you have something to say, why not say it directly on the phone!" Nancy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I want to meet in person. After all, some things are more sincere when discussed face to face," Irene said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, where do you want to meet?" Nancy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She left Emerald City by train at 7 pm, and the time she arranged to meet Irene was 3 pm in the afternoon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So after the appointment was made, she rushed to the train station, which should have been enough time-wise!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy arrived on time at the small park where she arranged to meet Irene at 3 pm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Nancy saw Irene, she noticed that Irene had many scratches on her face, and her overall mental state was completely different from before, haggard and thin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened to Irene after she resigned?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy secretly speculated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of her resignation, she hardly went to the hotel to inquire about it, and naturally did not know about Irene's drugging and embarrassing behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's take a walk. This place is quite close to where I live. If you agree to my request, I can give you the original recordings, and I won't keep any backups on my end," Irene said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can I trust you?" Nancy asked seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene smirked, "You don't seem to have any other choice but to trust me. Otherwise, I'll make the recordings public, and you'll be done for. At most, I'll be detained for a few days for the crime of eavesdropping."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy remained silent. The initiative was indeed on Irene's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We don't need to take a walk. I just want to know what your request is. I have to catch a train at 7 pm today," Nancy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We still have a few hours. That's enough," Irene said, then walked towards the park exit on her own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy could only follow her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the park was a dilapidated street, with many potholes on the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was considered the "slums" of Emerald City, where the poorest people lived.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's dirty and messy here," Irene suddenly spoke up. "But I've been living here for over ten years. Do you know what kind of mentality I have to live here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can change your life by yourself. If you really want to improve your life, you can work hard and naturally move away from here," Nancy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's easy for you to say. If you had been the Reed family's young lady, enjoying such glory and wealth, could you still say it's all up to yourself?" Irene said fiercely. "If you really did it all by yourself, you wouldn't have used Mick!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy smiled self-deprecatingly. On this point, she really had nothing to say to the other party.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, Irene kept telling Nancy about her time in the Reed family, where she was respected as a young lady and could go in and out with Mick every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clothes, food, toys - anything she wanted, she would have.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That is a life that many people envy.</span></p></div>
