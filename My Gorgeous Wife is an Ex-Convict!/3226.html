        <h1>Chapter 3224</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, a van suddenly appeared and screeched to a halt in front of her. Two young men wearing masks and caps, dressed in black, rushed towards her and reached out to grab her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was suddenly confused and before she could react, some people appeared from the side and stopped the two young men. With just a few moves, they subdued the two young men. The driver of the van saw this and immediately stepped on the gas, trying to quickly leave the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, right after that, something even more confusing happened to Valda. Several cars surrounded the van, forcing it to crash into the green belt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What is happening here?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was shocked and widened her eyes. Among the people who subdued two young men in front of her, she recognized one of them as a bodyguard she often saw around Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Madam, I apologize for startling you," the other person said respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Startled... It's not so much that I was startled, but rather that I was too stunned to even have the chance to be startled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Brian hurried over and looked at Valda with a nervous expression. He asked, "Valda, did anything happen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda shook her head with a sigh, as if she thought he was the one who had more important matters to attend to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, his face was pale and his forehead was covered in a thin layer of sweat. The hand that was holding hers was trembling with nervousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda grabbed Brian's hand with her other hand and said, "I'm okay, nothing happened to me. Your bodyguard acted quickly and these two people didn't even touch my clothes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, his facial expression improved slightly. However, immediately after, he suddenly hugged her tightly and said, "As long as you're okay, everything is fine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He cannot bear any more accidents happening to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That tight embrace made Valda feel a bit sore in her bones. But she knew that the tightness of the embrace was a reflection of how much he cared and worried about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hand lifted gently and stroked his hand back, tapping it lightly and rhythmically. "I'm okay, Brian. I'm fine now. You're here to protect me, and I'm doing well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice, her warmth, and even her breath were all easing his unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Brian muttered, "Hmm, you're okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, the two subdued individuals and the driver of the van were all taken back to the police station. Valda and Brian also went to the police station to give their statements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda learned from the police that these three individuals are unemployed youths who enjoy gambling and have a lot of debt. Today, at the anime convention, they learned about Brian's identity from others when he went on stage to compete. They became greedy and followed Brian and Valda out of the venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After seeing Valda alone, they wanted to kidnap her. However, their plan was foiled as they were quickly caught and subdued, resulting in them not obtaining anything and getting into trouble with the authorities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing the record, Valda and Brian left the police station. Curiously, Valda asked Brian, "How did you know that we might encounter danger today when we came to the anime exhibition?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the police station, she found out that the cars that had forced the van to stop were also driven by his subordinates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, he must have arranged for many people and vehicles to follow her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know," Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Valda blinked in surprise. "But how did they plan to kidnap me when your bodyguards and those cars were there to appear so timely?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It has always been there, not just today," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She widened her eyes and said, "It's been there all along. So you mean, on the first day we arrived here, you already arranged for them to follow us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In fact, it's not just the first day I've felt this way, it was the same over in Emerald City," Brian said. "Valda, I've lost you once before, so I won't allow myself to make the same mistake again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of this kind of mistake, he can't afford it.</p></div>
