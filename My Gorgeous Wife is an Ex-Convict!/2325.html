        <h1>Chapter 2323</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yesterday, you only said you didn&rsquo;t have feelings for me anymore. That doesn't mean my request isn't negotiable," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Negotiable?" He raised his brow slightly. "How do you think this is negotiable? What can you offer me in exchange for letting go of someone who nearly killed me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can be your insurance," she said after taking a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He narrowed his eyes slightly as he heard her hoarse voice saying, "You once suffered from leukemia and needed a bone marrow transplant. You've recovered, but... Uh, in case you have a relapse in the future..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more she spoke, the softer her voice became. After all, it was quite a taboo topic, and Martin Weiss had not relapsed in so many years. The possibility of it was small.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had to say it anyway!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You still need a suitable bone marrow donor if you ever relapse. Mine fits you the best, so I can be your insurance and keep you safe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The air seemed silent when she was done speaking, and his eyes seemed to pierce through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he said in a cold voice, "Kyla, are you here to take credit? Are you trying to make sure I don't forget that you donated me your bone marrow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not here to take credit. I'm just... telling you what I can offer," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You donated me your bone marrow, but I also gave you my liver. We're even. Whether I have a relapse or not is none of your concern!" he said as he headed toward his parked car nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla grabbed him. "Yes, we're even. But Martin Weiss, I&rsquo;ll pay whatever price I can pay. You can ask for my bone marrow, blood, or anything else. We have the same blood type. I can be your organ bank, can't I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the best price she could think of after thinking all night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had nothing that could be useful to him now except that she shared his rare blood type.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his face immediately darkened as soon as she said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What happened back then flashed across his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just because his feelings for her were subdued by hypnosis, it did not mean he did not remember what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he not plan to be her organ bank back then just she could be safe?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, the tables were turned and she was pleading so humbly in front of him. He should be happy, but he was in a terrible mood instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? You'll pay whatever price you can pay?" His voice grew colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she gave him an affirmative answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, then I want you to give Nelson and the baby in your belly to the Weiss family. They'll live with the Weiss family from now on. You can never see them again!" he said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him with wide eyes and turned ghastly pale as if she was struck by lightning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her lips quivered as if she wanted to say something, but nothing came out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Give the kids to the Weiss family? I'm never going to be able to see the kids?' The thought of it made her feel as if the sky was falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her children were her everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were even... something more precious than her own life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked so fragile as if she might fall at any moment.</p></div>
