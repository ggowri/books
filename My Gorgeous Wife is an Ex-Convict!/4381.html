        <h1>Chapter 4379 His Loss</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she leaned in closer, his face instantly turned even redder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her fair skin, highlighted by a vibrant blush, looked soft and tender, just like the cheeks of a baby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Harley felt an urge. She really wanted to reach out and touch those rosy cheeks, to see if they were truly as soft as they looked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley..." It wasn't until Calvert's stuttering voice rose that Harley suddenly snapped back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she realized, it seemed that she wasn't just thinking about it, but her fingers were actually touching his cheek, gently pinching that blush spot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was quite soft and felt even better than she had imagined when she touched it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Calvert looked utterly lost. His white teeth gently bit his lower lip, and his beautiful black eyes seemed to be glistening with a hint of moisture as he looked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That look... The word "captivating" flashed through Harley's mind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she could finally understand why, in movies and TV shows, men were so fascinated when women displayed such delicate and flustered expressions. She had initially thought it was a bit exaggerated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had realized that TV and film productions were still rooted in reality, regardless of whether the characters were male or female.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you hate it when I touch you like this?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't dislike it." His cheeks turned even </span><span>redder,</span><span> you could even say he really liked it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, if he didn't hate it, did that mean she could continue? Although her rational mind told her that such actions might not have been quite appropriate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her hand, just couldn't leave Calvert's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right, what exactly are you sorry for?" She remembered her previous question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because there's a kissing scene, so..." Calvert said awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I see, what's the big deal!" Harley said generously, finally withdrawing his hand reluctantly. "If you do well in the future and venture into the film and television industry, you won't be able to avoid kissing scenes. In fact, you might have more and more of them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Keep it up," Harley said, chuckling as she patted Calvert on the shoulder. "I noticed you had a few interruptions during your kissing scene today. You might want to practice more in private and get the feel of it. If you ever need it, I can introduce you to some acting coaches. You could learn a lot from them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only intended to ease his embarrassment and make him feel relaxed. However, she never expected that upon hearing Harley's words, Calvert's heart would continue to sink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Turns out, he was the only one she ever cared about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really didn't care whether he had any kissing scenes or not. Even if she saw them, it wouldn't bother her at all. Because from the start, she never liked him in that way, she only saw him as a friend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How ridiculous it was. The fact that he could become friends with her was already a huge blessing for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, he had inevitably become more and more greedy. He even started to wonder if she might have had some feelings for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The words she spoke today were undoubtedly shattering his delusions, warning him not to continue down this path of greed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll work hard to go even further on this path," Calvert said, a smile spreading across his face. His earlier expression of shy helplessness was gone, replaced by a calm smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though it was a beautiful smile, for some reason, it made her feel somewhat distant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he had put on a mask at that very moment.</span></p></div>
