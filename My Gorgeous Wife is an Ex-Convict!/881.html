        <h1>Chapter 880</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uncle Harper lets me ride on his shoulders and brings me to have fun!" The little one began to enumerate the fun activities with his fingers and most of these were a boy&rsquo;s favorite sports that were usually played together by father and son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla listened as a touch of sadness appeared in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how much she tried to take over the role of a father, it was a fact that Nelson grew up without a father. She had seen the envy in her son's eyes every time he saw other children with their fathers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But... Martin Weiss wouldn't be a good father. As far as Martin Weiss is concerned&hellip; Nelson should have never existed.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace saw the sadness in Kyla's eyes, so she quickly changed the subject. As she was leaving, she looked at Kyla and asked, "How's your injury?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing serious. It doesn't hurt much when I walk now," Kyla said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did Martin Weiss ever come looking for you again?" Grace asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook her head. Since the day she hurt herself in front of him, he had never appeared in front of her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just let me know if there's anything I can do for you. I may not be able to do much now, but... Many hands make light work," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled. "Alright, got it. How about you? How are you lately? That Uncle Harper Nelson mentioned, you and him..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're only friends. Maybe we're not even friends. He's just a former colleague at the Sanitation Service Center." Grace interrupted Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That man probably likes you." Otherwise, how could he have the patience to accompany them to the amusement park?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I don't want to think about romance anymore. It's too much of a luxury for me," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was too much of a luxury that she dared not expect to find someone and be with them forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After experiencing all this, what was once a girlish romance had been shattered by reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Kyla said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, love was also a luxury for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, it was easy to persuade people, but it was difficult when it came to yourself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella came to Brian's mansion to find him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she walked into Brian's bedroom, she did not see Brian but a purple dress on his bed. The skirt of the dress was lined with tiny flowers made of crushed diamonds and lace, which looked very beautiful. It gave off a feminine and romantic feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella might not be a girl anymore, but she had a love for beautiful things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but pick up the dress to see how it would look like on her in front of the mirror next to the wardrobe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it... a dress that Brian wants to give me? Is it a surprise?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This dress looks like it's worth a lot of money. If I put it on, it&rsquo;d probably raise my social class. Won't I be like one of those socialites in the city?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking in the mirror, Stella no longer saw herself as the blacksmith's wife from a small town who was bullied by her husband but as a socialite in Emerald City and the future Mrs. Gu.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the bathroom door behind her opened and Brian stepped out, his hair slightly damp.</p></div>
