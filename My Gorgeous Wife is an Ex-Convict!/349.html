        <h1>Chapter 348</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The call was finally over and Grace said, "What did your mother say to you? You look so miserable that you even mentioned kneeling on a keyboard."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else can it be? Blind dates," Lina said as she rolled her eyes. "My mother said that this man is a good catch. She managed to grab him from the other aunts so that I can have a go first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was speechless with her mother's thinking, </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mother seemed to think that if she could not get married in these two years, she might never get married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then go and meet him. Think of it as an opportunity," said Grace after thinking about it for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I'm frustrated enough. I might go crazy if I go on another blind date." Lina wanted to vomit blood every time she thought of how her mother pestered her to go on blind dates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why? Is there something else?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked at her best friend before saying, "Will it surprise you if I tell you I'm dating Hadwin?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace almost choked on her own spit. "You're dating Hadwin? Didn't you say that he was going to get even with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, get even." Lina nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then how..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He probably wants us to date first, and after I fall in love with him, he'll kick me aside and give me a taste of falling into hell from heaven. Isn't that what they do on TV dramas?" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the question was would Hadwin take his revenge in such a childish way? Grace was highly skeptical about this. She heard Jason mention that Hadwin was cruel. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him, a bastard, to inherit the Stephenson family and become the Stephenson family's patriarch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even the lawful mistress of the Stephenson family and her two sons were at Hadwin's disposal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think so?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else can it be?" Lina shrugged. "Anyway, I've decided that it's all right if he wants to take his revenge this way. I'll date him for a few months, then pretend to fall in love with him. When he dumps me, I'll act like I'm heartbroken or something. That way, he'll probably feel better and let me go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Grace was impressed with her best friend's thinking. Could she fool a man like Hadwin by pretending?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man had probably experienced all the cheating and dirty tricks since childhood and should have a pair of eyes that could read through people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't it occur to you that he might still be&hellip; in love with you?" Grace hesitated a little before saying. She thought of the first time she saw Hadwin staring at her best friend through the glass window and of the time she and Jason went to the Stephenson mansion to save her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Hadwin had &lsquo;kidnapped&rsquo; Lina to his mansion, Lina was unharmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Hadwin wanted revenge, then Lina's fate now would have been a lot worse.</p></div>
