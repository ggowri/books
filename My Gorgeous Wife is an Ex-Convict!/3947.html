        <h1>Chapter 3945</h1>
        <div>.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was a little surprised to see Nancy so focused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He walked up and looked at the interface of Nancy's phone, which was a clearance game.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was no stranger to games, as he was in charge of the game company under Reed Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The game Nancy was playing was a casual game developed by the group's game company a few years ago, which Mick had played before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was precisely because he had played it before and had enough understanding of the game that Mick was stunned when he saw the game clearance points on the phone interface.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There are definitely not many people who can reach this score.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The further you go, the more the game tests the player's hand speed and logical thinking ability.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Nancy was obviously good at both.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing another round, Nancy finally stopped and stretched her long body with a yawn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the middle of her stretch, her body suddenly stiffened, and the corner of her eye caught a glimpse of Mick standing next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When did he stand here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You play the game well," Mick said with a slight smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When did you come back?" Nancy asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"About fifteen minutes ago," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her expression changed, "Then why didn't you call me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't want to interrupt you since you're so focused on the game," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"...," she didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, are you planning on maintaining that posture while talking to me?" Mick asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy suddenly realized that she had been stretching while talking to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt embarrassed and quickly put her hands down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The meeting today lasted longer than I expected. Are you hungry? There's still some time before dinner. I can have my secretary bring you some snacks," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, thank you. I just had a cup of coffee and I'm not hungry," Nancy replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I have some documents to work on. Will you continue?" he said, walking back to his desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Continue? Nancy wondered if he meant for her to continue playing the game.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Holding her phone, Nancy lost interest in the game and found herself glancing at Mick sitting at his desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was the first time she had seen him in his office attire, a suit and tie with his hair combed back, revealing his full forehead. He looked more mature and serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was the man she had spent the night with?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although they didn't actually "sleep together" that night, in a way, they did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to Mick's later explanation, it was because she insisted on sleeping with him that they ended up sharing a bed that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was just sleeping, nothing more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, even so, it shocked her immensely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, her memory was fragmented, and she couldn't remember what it was like lying in bed with Mick.</p></div>
