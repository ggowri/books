        <h1>Chapter 4239 Rely on</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmond didn't pay much attention to Kit's attitude.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my son, don't you think I want you to live well? The way you are now, someone is interested in you. You should be grateful. If you serve that woman well, it will benefit both of us. Isn't that a good deal?" Edmond said without a trace of guilt.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Serve her?" Kit suddenly laughed. "Unfortunately, I don't want to serve anyone anymore."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, he had sacrificed his pride and dignity to climb up the social ladder. He thought that as long as he could earn enough money, he wouldn't have to fear anything and wouldn't have to worry about returning to a life of nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he had some money, a house to live in, and could eat well every day. Compared to his days in the orphanage, life was much better.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But ironically, he still felt like he had nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a void in his heart, a terrifying emptiness. He didn't even know why he continued living every day.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't want to serve anyone anymore? Are you still thinking about that woman from the Stephenson family?" Edmond mocked. "Unfortunately, no matter how well you serve her, what good does it do? She still abandoned you, and now what have you gained? Nothing. She's living well, while you're disabled."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's my own business, and it's none of your concern!" Kit responded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, it's none of my concern, huh? Well, I've said everything I wanted to say today. You better serve that woman obediently, or else you never know when your other hand might end up like your right hand," Edmond threatened.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit knew his father was trying to intimidate him. Perhaps for both him and his father, serving that woman would maximize their interests and make them wealthier in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't want to live like he did before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We don't need to discuss this anymore. I also hope to never see you again," Kit coldly refused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, so you won't listen to me at all, huh? Well, don't think I can't control you anymore," Edmond said, raising his hand as if to strike Kit's face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Instinctively, Kit closed his eyes, prepared to endure the blow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was already accustomed to this kind of thing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as he endured, his father would eventually leave after venting his anger.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the expected slap never came.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit heard his father gasping for breath beside him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slowly, he opened his eyes and saw a figure standing in front of him. It was hard for him to believe his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Tina!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina had suddenly appeared before him and had even grabbed hold of Edmond's hand, preventing him from striking.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss. Stephenson!" Edmond exclaimed, surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never expected Mr. Ingram to show me something like this. To what extent can a father go to harm his own son?" Tina said coldly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmond frowned, with the Stephenson family and the Hunter family behind Tina, he naturally couldn't easily offend them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, after thinking for a moment, a smile appeared on Edmond's face: "I think Miss. Stephenson may have misunderstood. I just wanted to find someone for Kit to rely on, considering his disability."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Tina sneered, "Then Mr. Ingram, you don't have to worry about this. Even if he is disabled, he doesn't have to worry about his livelihood. The Stephenson family can naturally be his support in the future!"</span></p></div>
