        <h1>Chapter 1136</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, from another point of view, her best friend had just ended things with Jason and was suffering heartbreak. Would making Grace the maid of honor make her sad? Would it make things even worse?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In three months?" Grace was stunned, not expecting her best friend to drop such a huge bomb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, Hadwin said he'll use three months to resolve the Stephenson family's internal conflict, and we'll get married after that," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although it seemed too fast to her at first, she was at ease once she had made up her mind to get married in three months. She even began to look forward to the moment when she would become Hadwin Stephenson's wife!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If so, congratulations!" Grace said with a smile and sincerely gave her best wishes to her best friend. "Of course, I'll be the maid of honor for your wedding! I'll be upset if you didn&rsquo;t ask me to be your maid of honor!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter if you feel reluctant..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, Grace reached out her arms and embraced Lina. "Lina, I'm not at all reluctant. I know you're worried about me. You're worried that I'll think of my relationship and be upset, aren't you? But if so, you think too little of our friendship."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned. Grace knew all about her thoughts and concerns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm really happy that you can have a happy ending with Hadwin Stephenson. Even though I may never wear a wedding dress, more than anyone else, I hope that you get to wear it. Therefore, I must accompany you and see you happy on your wedding day!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Little by little, Grace's voice crept into Lina's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina embraced Grace back and said with a sore nose, "What do you mean you'll never wear a wedding dress? You'll get to wear a wedding dress too! I'm sure of it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not want Lina to worry too much about her, so she replied with a smile, "Okay, I'll try my best to let myself wear a wedding dress one day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the two got out of the car, Grace asked, "You're going to marry Hadwin Stephenson in three months. What did your parents say about this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They don't know yet. Hadwin will return to Emerald City in a few days and visit my parents at my house," said Lina. She had no idea how her parents would react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two walked up the steps along the hillside toward the temple as they chatted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The temple was built on a hill, so it was a little tiring to walk up, but it was also a good opportunity to have a look at the scenery along the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she walked up the steps and looked at the scenery, Grace felt as if her worries had been alleviated by a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that walking like this was pretty good!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they reached the temple, Lina cried out a "huh" before saying, "There seem to be a lot more security guards here today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Security guards?" Grace looked around, and indeed, there were several men in uniform standing at the temple&rsquo;s entrance. Every pilgrim going in and out was checked with metal detectors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When did temples become so strict?" Grace asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have no idea. There were at most two security guards at the entrance when I came here with my mother." Lina was also puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After being checked with metal detectors, the two entered the temple.</p></div>
