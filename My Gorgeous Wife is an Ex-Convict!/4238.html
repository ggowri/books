        <h1>Chapter 4236 Unexpected News</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler, do you really love me?" Tina thought and asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, I love you," he answered without hesitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why can you easily let go? Can you easily decide to divorce me? Or do you think that divorcing me doesn't matter to you, that you'll only feel a little sad and then move on?" Tina asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more she understood this man's emotions, the more she felt like she couldn't understand them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler chuckled self-deprecatingly. How could it be easy?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could it only be a little sad?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It</span><span> wa</span><span>s </span><span>just that this time, he didn't want her </span><span>to make her choice</span><span> out of sympathy or a sense of responsibility towards him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the previous Tina made that choice because she loved him, then this time, he hoped for the same.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once a person has experienced something good, they won't easily accept something slightly worse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This </span><span>wa</span><span>s </span><span>also his last bit of pride and self-esteem.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be fine. If you don't love me, but still stay bound to me by marriage, then you'll feel miserable, and I don't want to have a wife who doesn't love me. So if you still can't love me in the end, let's get a divorce," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina frowned at Chandler, feeling that something was off, but she couldn't pinpoint it.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, Tina and Chandler spent their days together. It couldn't be denied that Chandler treated her really well and understood her well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she had lost her memory, her body's preferences hadn't changed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What she liked to eat, drink, how she liked to dress, and what movies or songs she liked, Chandler knew them well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The feeling of being with Chandler was comfortable and familiar...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, it was familiar!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like a natural blending, a habit formed over a long time at a subconscious level.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, he would casually feed her fruits from the fruit bowl, and she would naturally eat them as if they were only natural.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way of getting along also strengthened her attachment to him unconsciously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe falling in love with this kind of man really </span><span>happen</span><span>ed</span><span> </span><span>quickly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps a year, or even half a year or a few months, </span><span>wa</span><span>s </span><span>enough.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina thought this way.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After having a good meal with Chandler at a restaurant, Tina went to the restroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her body was gradually recovering, and there was also good news from the hospital. In a few more days, Quinn would be able to be discharged.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of her daughter, </span><span>Tina</span><span> felt her</span><span> </span><span>heart surge with strong emotions. In her most difficult days, it was this child who accompanied her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When</span><span> she had always been trying to protect </span><span>her</span><span> </span><span>child, it was also this child who supported her, allowing her to have some kind of belief in her heart even when she lost all her memories, without giving up on herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for this child, she wouldn't have made up her mind to escape from the village.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she wouldn't have been saved by Kit...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When this name flashed through Tina's mind, a pain still struck her heart, just as intense as before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, have you seen the news? It says Kit seems to be disabled."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw a former idol star, who used to be so glamorous, but I never expected that </span><span>he</span><span> </span><span>would </span><span>become disabled after retiring. It's really sad."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The conversation between the two women reached Tina's ears.</span></p></div>
