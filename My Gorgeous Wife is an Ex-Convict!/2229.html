        <h1>Chapter 2227</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was happy about the way she looked. After all, women liked looking beautiful no matter how old they were!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The triplets were at the residence, and so was Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper looked at Nelson Corbyn, who was wearing a small suit. She immediately approached him, "Nelson, you look so good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn smiled. "Jasper, you&rsquo;re beautiful too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Indeed, Jasper was wearing a light purple tutu dress and a bow of the same color on her head. With her adorable face, she looked just like a fairy who had descended to the mortal world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper instantly beamed when she was praised for how beautiful she looked. She liked today's dress. Her mother had dressed her up so beautifully that she wanted to take photos and show them to William later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a pity that William was not here. Otherwise, she could see Tina with William today! Jasper Reed's smile could not help being tinted with disappointment at the thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, we're leaving in a minute." Grace began to arrange their transportation, while Jason looked on with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Reed family&rsquo;s house was no longer as cold and quiet as it was when there were only him and Old master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His house now had Grace and the kids. It was lively!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the old master saw this, would he regret what he had instructed Secretary Wang to do before he died?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Old master Reed had not planned all that, Grace and he would have suffered much less.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd arrived at the party&rsquo;s venue. It was at the largest five-star hotel in Emerald City, and Hadwin Stephenson had booked the entire floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The decorations were extremely luxurious, which also showed how important the full moon celebration was to Hadwin Stephenson. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides the relatives of the Stephenson family and the Sweeney family, most of the people who attended the party were socialites. One could even see many famous people one usually saw on TV.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After entering the party, Grace brought Nelson Corbyn, the triplets, and Veronica Barlow to see Tina Stephenson. Kyla said hello to Lina before giving her the present and red packet. "A little something for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina did not refuse. After putting them away, she said to Kyla, "Kyla... Hadwin also invited Martin Weiss to the party today." She was afraid Kyla would mind Martin Weiss, so she mentioned it to give her best friend a heads-up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled. "It's okay. We're not enemies. If he&rsquo;s here at the party, Nelson can get to meet him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's great. I was afraid you'd be mad," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't. Martin Weiss and I will be meeting each other in the future too because of the children," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was normal for Hadwin Stephenson to invite Martin Weiss. After all, Martin Weiss had helped him out when Lina was in a coma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina breathed a sigh of relief. Then, she said with a smile, "Kyla, you're so beautiful today. People will think you're a celebrity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Lina said was true. Kyla had always been pretty. She had moderate height and good body proportions. She was also slightly thin, making her look good in any clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla just did little to dress up, and she would often wear dark-colored clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the pale blue dress and elaborate makeup today made her look exceptionally beautiful.</p></div>
