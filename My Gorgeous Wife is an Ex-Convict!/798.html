        <h1>Chapter 797</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence looked at his boss who was silent in the car. He gave off an icy aura, so much so that the temperature in the car seemed to be much lower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove to the company building, and Jason got out of the car. Suddenly, someone darted out from the side and tried to rush toward Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next moment, the security guards at the building's entrance had easily subdued the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a man of about 30 years old, dressed in ordinary clothes. After he was overpowered, he shouted at Jason, "It's you, isn't it? I heard that you're the one who blacklisted our goddess Lily! Who are you to blacklist her? What has she done to you? Isn't her sister your ex-fianc&eacute;e?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as he was going to get justice for the goddess in his heart and wanted to argue with Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence was secretly frightened when he listened. Well... Grace had something to do with Lily's blacklisting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that Young Master Reed and Grace had broken up, anything related to Grace was a taboo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was someone who dared to ask for trouble here of all places.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Reed, let the police deal with him," said Terrence. Then, he instructed the security guards nearby to call the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the man kept on shouting, "Sure, call the police. I'm not afraid. I'm getting justice for my goddess Lily. You're powerful, Jason. No one is speaking up for the goddess Lily, so I will speak up for her. Jason, people like you have never really loved anyone. You don't know it's possible to sacrifice everything for the one you love. I can sacrifice everything for my goddess Lily!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man was apparently a big fan of Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of the employees who were going in and out of the building as well as the staff at the front desk looked this way because of the disturbance he caused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Standing next to Jason, Terrence could clearly feel that Young Master Reed's aura... had changed after the man said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? You love Lily so much that you can sacrifice everything for her?" The cold voice escaped Jason's mouth with some solemnity that made people shudder uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of... Of course!" the man replied stubbornly, but fear could not help but rise in his heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell! What do I have to be afraid of? I came here today to stand up for my goddess Lily! If someone here sees this incident and posts it online, I can leave my goddess Lily a good impression!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason suddenly put a hand on the man's head. Then, he bent down and looked down at him. "Then, let's see how much you can sacrifice for her..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does he mean?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man had not figured it out yet. Then, a sharp pain almost made him faint!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face was pressed down on the concrete floor, and punches kept falling on him. His mouth smelled of blood...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence saw this scene and it immediately gave him goosebumps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Young Master Reed's furious! Otherwise, with such a minor character, Young Master Reed wouldn't have done it himself. Once Young Master Reed gets angry, everything... would only end badly!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man was still able to yell at the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Toward the end, it was clear that he did not even have the strength to speak. Terrence hurriedly asked the security guards to keep other people away from them to avoid any negative press. Then, he said hurriedly, "Young Master Reed, the police are going to be here in a minute. Just let the police deal with people like him. You mustn't get your hands dirty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence said this as a desperate measure, hoping to persuade Jason.</p></div>
