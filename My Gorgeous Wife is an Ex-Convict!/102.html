        <h1>Chapter 101</h1>
        <div><p>After Grace left, Jason looked around the small rental apartment and felt empty inside.</p><p>He picked up the scarf she had placed on the table and wrapped it around his neck. The corner of his lips curled into a slight smile.</p><p>When Jason walked out of the rental apartment, Terrence had already been waiting outside for a long time. When he saw his boss, he was stunned. The president had never liked wearing a plain scarf, but then... he was wearing one.</p><p>And when Jason walked closer to him, Terrence studied the threads on the scarf and the knitting method. He was almost sure that it was a hand-made scarf.</p><p>There seemed to be only one answer to Mr. Reed&#x27;s hand-woven scarf.</p><p>This scarf was probably knitted by Grace!</p><p>&quot;Mr. Reed, we&#x27;re going to...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let&#x27;s go to the hospital. Today, I probably should have dinner with the Old Master.&quot; Jason ordered.</p><p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Terrence responded. He started the car and headed for the hospital.</p><p>The bus stopped at a place not far from the southern entrance of the town where Grace got off. It had already been three years, and this town seemed to have changed a lot. Some of the muddy roads had been rebuilt with cement.</p><p>On the way, she met some of the neighbors who used to live close to her grandmother&#x27;s house. They all pointed at her and whispered to each other. Grace was already used to this.</p><p>Ever since she was released from prison, those who knew her in the past could not help but talk about her when they saw her.</p><p>When she arrived at her grandmother&#x27;s house, she found it to be crowded with her relatives.</p><p>Seeing her, her second uncle forced a smile and said, &quot;Grace! Come on in and have a seat. We&#x27;ve been waiting for you for a long time.&quot;</p><p>Grace was a little surprised. After all, after what had happened to her, her second uncle had even sent someone to tell her to not implicate them at the courthouse.</p><p>&quot;Come, come, sit down!&quot; Her third aunt walked over with a warm expression and pulled Grace down to the chair. Then, her uncle-in-law, aunt-in-law, second uncle-in-law, and third uncle... All these relatives surrounded her and asked her about her well-being.</p><p>Grace had a flash of doubt in her eyes. &quot;Where&#x27;s grandma?&quot; she asked.</p><p>&quot;Grandma is taking a nap right now. You can go see her when she wakes up,&quot; her third aunt said.</p><p>Her uncle then said, &quot;Grace, now that you are out of prison, you have to be a decent person. You&#x27;re not with anyone now, right? Women should always find a man to rely on. I will introduce you to a good partner later.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uncle, I don&#x27;t want to find anyone to get together with right now.&quot; Grace refused.</p><p>&quot;Sigh, child, what&#x27;s wrong with you...&quot; Her uncle seemed to want to say something else, but her third aunt winked at him, and he didn&#x27;t say anything more.</p><p>At this moment, Grace&#x27;s grandmother, Susie, was in an intense argument with her husband.</p><p>&quot;I disagree. I absolutely don&#x27;t agree to marry her off to that fool. She&#x27;s going to ruin her whole life!&quot; Susie shouted.</p><p>Mr. Kelleigh snorted and said, &quot;She has already been ruined for a lifetime. What do you think Grace can do now that she is out of prison? I have asked around about it. She&#x27;s a street cleaner now. It&#x27;s better for her to get married while she is still young. The Miller family said that as long as Grace gives birth to a baby for the Miller family, they will support her for a lifetime. I am doing this for her sake.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What do you mean you&#x27;re doing it for her sake? You are simply greedy for the Miller family&#x27;s money!&quot; Susie said with hatred, &quot;You are selling Grace off!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mom, what do you mean we are selling her off?&quot; The third aunt came over and said, &quot;Dad is doing this for our whole family. My nephews are going to get married soon. Now, with the 300,000 dollars of the Miller family, they can at least get a down payment if they buy a house in the town. Mom, you can&#x27;t let your grandson fail to get a wife.&quot;</p><p></p></div>
