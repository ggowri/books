        <h1>Chapter 281</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Something was going on! Grace looked at her best friend curiously. "Is there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I guess so." Lina laughed. "I had a crush on someone back then, but he looked so young. With him, I felt like an old cow eating young grass. It was kind of an encounter, hmm... It was nice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." An old cow eating young grass? Grace was a bit speechless. Her best friend was only 27 years old. "Is he very young?" She asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I guess? He&rsquo;s quite young." She shrugged and said, "I met him abroad... Then, oh, never mind, he probably doesn't even remember what I look like now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, a handsome boy like him had a lot of girls around him. Would he remember her, someone he had only been with for a few days?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina thought to herself, 'It&rsquo;s enough to just have an experience like that sometimes.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face changed slightly when she heard her best friend say &lsquo;abroad&rsquo;. She remembered that Lina went abroad only once. That was before her accident. Lina was going to apply for further study at a foreign school, so she went for an interview at the school she was applying for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only later because of her accident that Lina did not even go for the interview and went straight back home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, it was her fault that Lina lost an opportunity to further her studies. It was also fair to say that she had changed Lina's fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No wonder Lina's parents were still upset. Even Grace herself felt a lump in her throat every time she thought about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her best friend's expression right now, Lina knew that she was probably thinking of how she did not get to study abroad back then and was feeling guilty. Therefore, she immediately said, "Don't make a fool of yourself. It's none of your business that I didn't go abroad. My grades were just so-so. Even if I went for the interview, the school wouldn't pick me either!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, thank you. Some day, if you need me, I'll go through fire and water for you!" Grace said seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You fool." Lina patted her best friend on the shoulder. "Why did you say that? It's disgusting. You might as well thank me in the future when your case is reversed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." Grace smiled, but there was a layer of worry in her heart. Even though she was obsessed with reversing her case, but... Could she really reverse it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If there was such a thing as a man behind the scenes, could they still find him after three years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace went back to the Reed Residence at night, Jason was sitting in the living room and was staring at something in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace approached him, it turned out that what he had in his hand was the picture he took from her today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that she was back, Jason put away the photo and smiled at her. "You're back. How was your meeting with your friend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It went quite well," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is the clue your friend gave you about the case useful?" he seemed to ask casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It should be useful, but I don't know why the witness lied. I'm afraid that he will avoid me when I go looking for him, so I want to collect more information about him before making any further plans," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then she looked at Jason as if something was wrong. "Do you believe that I&rsquo;m not the one who killed your fianc&eacute;e in that car accident?"</p></div>
