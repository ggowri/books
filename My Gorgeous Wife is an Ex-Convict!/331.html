        <h1>Chapter 330</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the lunch box and quickly began to eat with her head down. All she wanted now was to finish it quickly and leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you eating so fast because you're eager to leave?" Jason's voice rang softly in the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ahem..." Grace choked, nearly spitting out her food. All she could do was hold her hands and cough with difficulty. Soon, her face became extremely red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, she stopped coughing, but the palm of her hand, which was over her mouth earlier, had some grains of rice on it. Thus, she decided to take a tissue and wipe her palms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could take the tissue, his fingers grabbed her hand and drew it toward himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She uncomfortably twisted her wrist but did not break free. "My hand is dirty, I need to wipe it," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Dirty?" He chuckled with amusement. "I don't find it dirty at all." As he spoke, he lowered his head. His lips clung to her palm while the tip of his tongue licked the grains of rice off her palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened. Her palms felt terribly hot, and his licks seemed to touch the nerves in her palms and spread it through her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The burning sensation of her palm seemed to follow her blood flow and caused her body temperature to rise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right." His voice rang, seemingly reluctant to part with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. Then, she came to herself and found that he had licked all the grains of rice on her palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he held on to her hand while his beautiful, amorous eyes gazed at her. "The grains of rice on your palm are sweet. I wish you had more." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt as if her heart skipped a beat. It was almost as if he was implying something, and his eyes were full of desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly lowered her eyes and did not look directly at him. His gaze seemed to have some magic power that haunted her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a good thing he did not plan to hold her hand all the time. His fingers loosened, and her hand was free at last.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly continued to eat the rest of her meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A moment later, his voice rang in her ear. "Dining with you makes me feel like I've gone back in time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Go back in time. They could no longer &lsquo;go back in time&rsquo;, which seemed like a dream, and everything belonging to &lsquo;Jay&rsquo; was buried deep in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time Grace got back to the small restaurant, it was almost one o'clock. Kyla Corbyn did not seem suspicious that it took her nearly an hour to deliver the order, but Grace said, "Sorry it took so long."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing. You probably had to make several trips to deliver so much food by yourself. Thank you for your hard work," said Kyla Corbyn. "They didn't say anything, did they?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the proprietor, of course she was most worried about receiving complaints after delivering the food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." Grace felt a strange sense of guilt.</p></div>
