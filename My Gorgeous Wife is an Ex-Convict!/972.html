        <h1>Chapter 971</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella, who was standing next to Brian, was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian... didn't even hear what I said. He's only thinking about Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even his blatant murderous intent and indifference right now is because of Grace!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella had a hunch that if Elise Dean was still unwilling to say anything, Brian would really kill someone. He would kill for Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace! Why her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian thinks I'm the one who saved him when he was a child! It's me he needs to care about, not Grace!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elise Dean trembled even more now, and the fear of death almost enveloped her. It was not like she had not filmed a chokehold scene before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no matter how fierce the men who co-acted with her looked and no matter how heavy-handed they were when they choked her, she had never felt such fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those dark, cold phoenix eyes were staring at her without any hesitation. The hand on her neck was so tight that the man&rsquo;s fingers felt like steel. She could not break free no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was too overwhelming for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">An intense fear welled up in Elise Dean's heart. 'If I had known that Grace knows Young Master Gu, then I&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, she felt the fingers on her neck loosen and heard the cold voice in her ears saying, "I'm giving you one last chance. Where the hell is Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I don't know. I've only mentioned her... to one of my fans... I don't know what happened after that..." stammered Elise Dean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where and when did you last see this fan? Man or woman?" Brian asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Over&hellip; Over in the bathroom. About... 15 minutes ago. A man..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, she felt the hand choking her neck loosen suddenly. She immediately fell to the ground coughing, looking like a complete mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without giving her another glance, Brian hastily took out his phone and ordered the people at the other end of the line, "Find all the film studio's surveillance footage. I need you to check all the footage in the last 30 minutes. Look for the man Elise Dean met and talked to 15 minutes ago in the bathroom in Section 3-B..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian finished, he stared at Elise Dean. "You'd better pray Grace is alright, or I'll make your life a living hell!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he sprinted off in the direction of the film studio's security room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella hurriedly followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elise Dean lay limp on the ground, her face shockingly pale. She was a glorious actress, but now, everyone was looking at her with sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone knew that even if Grace was fine, Elise Dean's career in the entertainment industry was over! Her years of hard work were over in one night!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who the hell is&hellip; Grace? Isn't there a rumor that a woman named Stella might be the crown prince's new girlfriend?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But the crown prince didn&rsquo;t even glance at Stella who was next to him and only cared about Grace's safety!'</p></div>
