        <h1>Chapter 1400</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that Grace was about to turn and leave, he suddenly wanted to rush forward to grab her so he could ask her questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had only taken two steps before Jason's bodyguards stopped him. He could not get near Grace at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait!" he cried out, his voice almost shaking. "What do you mean by that? What do you mean she saved my life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stopped, and her eyes fell on Martin Weiss's pale face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man who had been cold and solemn now showed a look of fear as if he was afraid that the answer he would hear might break him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace glared at him, still unable to hide her fury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sneered. "What do I mean? Martin Weiss, you're standing here alive and kicking because Kyla donated you her bone marrow. If Kyla hadn't been so selfless, you'd be nothing but ashes now. Knowing this now, can you still force her to kneel to her enemy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss only felt his blood freezing instantly. He could not help but tremble. He felt as if he was overwhelmed by the fear surging in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He understood every word Grace said but did not seem to understand the meaning of the words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Wasn't it Paisley... who donated me the bone marrow? Why is Grace saying it was Kyla Corbyn?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nonsense!" Paisley Daniels, who was in the hospital bed, shouted to Grace to conceal her guilt. "I was the one who donated Martin the bone marrow. When did it become Kyla Corbyn? Even if you're Kyla Corbyn's friend, you can't distort the truth like that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. How can you slander Paisley?" Mrs. Daniels also chimed in quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Daniels even looked at Martin Weiss nervously. "Martin, you don't believe them, do you? Could there be such a coincidence that Kyla Corbyn was the one who donated her bone marrow to you? It was an anonymous donation. Paisley also found out by accident that you were the one who received her bone marrow and acknowledged you. It was only then she began dating you! This woman is just talking nonsense!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it... really nonsense?' Martin Weiss stared at Grace, his eyes already turning scarlet. "Are you randomly making this up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's voice grew colder. "I hope I&rsquo;m making this up too and that it's not the truth. That way, at least Kyla would have done a good thing and saved a good man, not a man bent on taking revenge on her, making her life hell!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes fell on Paisley Daniels's face again as she spoke, "You're really shameless to take credit for the bone marrow donation. You didn't even hesitate to refuse when the bone marrow bank called you first!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels was impatient and angry. "You... You're slandering me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "We'll find out whether I'm slandering you once we listen to the phone recording. You probably didn't know the phone call was recorded, did you? Just because it's a little difficult to find the record after all these years doesn't mean we can't find it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels was stunned. 'Phone... recording?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How can it be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is there a phone recording? Why didn&rsquo;t I know about this?'</p></div>
