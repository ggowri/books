        <h1>Chapter 3794</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason knew that his parents probably already knew what had happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom and Dad, I don't want to talk about this anymore. I don't regret hitting Daniel that day. If he really wants to sue me, then let him sue me," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You child..." Grace spoke up, "We just want to know what happened at the time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just that I haven't been able to let go of the past, but from now on, I won't be like this anymore," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by 'won't be like this again', do you have a plan?" Grace asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I plan to go back abroad, and not come back for at least two years," Mason said. Two years should be enough time for him to calm down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Two years?" Grace was surprised. "But didn't you just come back as an exchange student?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as I handle the procedures, I can go back to a foreign school. It's not that complicated," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Jason asked, "What happened between you and Veronica?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's body stiffened slightly at the question. "We broke up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Broke up?" Grace was shocked. She had just found out that her son had gotten back together with Veronica not long ago. How could they break up so soon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Jason furrowed his brows at the answer. "You really broke up with her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you regret it?" Jason asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing to regret," Mason said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason looked at his son's indifferent expression and said, "Alright, you can go out first. I'll take care of things with Daniel. If you really won't regret it, then I won't stop you from going abroad. But it will take at least two months to arrange."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was puzzled. "Why do I have to wait for two months?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he hoped to leave Emerald City as soon as possible, to escape this city with Veronica in it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Escape...he suddenly realized. It was strange that he would use the word "escape". Was he really afraid of staying in a city with Veronica?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Are you afraid that the deeper your feelings for her become, the more painful it will be?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or are you afraid of something else?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You went abroad for several years before, and finally returned to Emerald City. Now you plan to go abroad again. Shouldn't you stay at home for a few more months and spend more time with your family? Do you know how much your mother missed you when you went abroad?" Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason looked at his worried mother and finally said in a deep voice, "I understand. I will leave in two months."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Mason left the study, Grace looked at her husband with a puzzled expression. "Why did you agree to Mason? He broke up with Veronica and suddenly said he wants to go abroad again. Why didn't you try to persuade him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You know your son's personality. If I could persuade him, he wouldn't have gone abroad to study in the first place," Jason said. "Two months is also a period of calm for him. If the feelings between him and Veronica are really deep enough, then things will surely turn around."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what if things don't turn around? What if he still insists on going abroad?" Grace said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then it can only mean that their feelings are not deep enough," Jason said. "This is also a test for them. After all, they are still young and will experience many things in </span><span>life. If they can't even pass this test, how can they stay together for a lifetime?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace didn't say anything more after hearing this. After all, her husband was right, and there were still two months left. Maybe there would be some changes between Mason and Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, besides Veronica, Grace couldn't imagine her son falling in love with any other woman in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, Veronica was once his whole world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p></div>
