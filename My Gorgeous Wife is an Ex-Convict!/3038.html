        <h1>Chapter 3036</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I saved your mommy before, but I wouldn't consider myself a friend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I see," muttered Simon. He reached into his backpack and pulled out his child's phone. Then, he walked up to the stall selling peace charms and scanned the code to buy one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching Simon skillfully scan and pay with his phone, Valda couldn't help but sigh with admiration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simon bought a peace charm and handed it over to Brian, saying "You must make sure to give it to mommy's friend." The little guy's expression was very serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." Brian took the peace charm and responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the afternoon, the three of them returned to tMason Swansonty area and planned to find a restaurant for dinner. While Brian was parking the car in the parking lot, Valda suddenly exclaimed, "Oh!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think I saw Grace," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I saw Grace getting out of the car with her three children in this same parking lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian parked the car and Valda got out of the car holding Simon's hand. They shouted towards Grace's direction, "Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked towards the voice and saw her. She immediately responded with a greeting and waved at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment, Brian and Jason also got out of the car. When they saw each other, they silently faced each other for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that we would meet in Deer Capital, it's such a coincidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two groups of people approached each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at the three children with Grace, two of whom were Mick and Jasper, the triplets, and the other was William from the Barlow family, whom she had seen before at the birthday party for the Reed family's youngest daughter, Jasmine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, Grace also looked at the children with Valda, who were... Amber's children, Simon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Grace recognized the little one, she had only seen pictures of Amber's children in the information before and had not really seen them in person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you guys..." both sides said in unison, then laughed together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jasper is participating in the piano competition at Deer Capital today, and Mick and William also want to watch the competition live, so Jason and I brought them here to eat dinner after the competition." Grace spoke first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I came to Deer Capital to participate in a comic exchange meeting, and Brian accompanied me. After the exchange meeting ended, I wanted to stroll around Deer Capital. Simon happened to come to find me today, so I brought Simon to play together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, it was really Amber's son, Simon! Grace thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Brian took out the amulet he bought for Amber and handed it to Grace. "Here, this is for you to give to Amber."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"For Amber?" Grace looked confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was bought by Simon for his mommy," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly realized and looked at Simon, "Is this what you want to give to your mommy? Auntie Grace will definitely hand it over to your mommy herself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simon looked at Grace and asked, "Are you Mommy's friend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I am your mommy's friend," Grace replied. "I also know that your name is Simon!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one blinked and then asked, "So... do you happen to know how Mommy is doing in Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know some," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one had a look of wanting to know but feeling too shy to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled and said, "Shall I tell you what I said earlier?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a glimmer of joy flashed in those dark eyes.</p></div>
