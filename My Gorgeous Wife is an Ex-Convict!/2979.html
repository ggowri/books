        <h1>Chapter 2977</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, men like Brian still look elegant even when sitting on a small stool outside of a shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially his formal attire made him stand out from the other diners, attracting many curious glances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of the women couldn't help but be amazed by Brian's gaze, which was particularly captivating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, his face is handsome but also seems to carry a sense of detachment, giving off a taste of abstinence, yet it also makes people more curious to explore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda can understand the amazement in those women's eyes, after all, she herself is often amazed by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially when I wake up every day and see his handsome face so close to me, my heart feels like it's been hit by a thousand attacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, a young woman dressed in trendy clothes approached Brian and said, "Excuse me, sir. I would like to be friends with you. Can you give me your contact information?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman is very cute with long hair down to her shoulders and delicate makeup on her face. As she speaks, she wears a smile on her face and her eyes are full of anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For an average man, it's natural to find it difficult to refuse such an approach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, many men around looked at Brian with envy, while women looked at Valda with sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda and Brian were sitting very close to each other, so it appeared to others that they were together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's appearance is plain and simple, like a bowl of clear noodles. Her clothing is also of the so-called timeless classic style, which means it never changes and is just ordinary, run-of-the-mill clothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, he/she is no match for that young woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost everyone thought that Brian would agree to provide his contact information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian just looked at the other person with cold eyes and said, "No, I can't give it to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman's smile froze on her face, and it took her a while to force a smile and say, "I didn't mean any harm, I just wanted to get to know you. Besides, having more friends is a good thing, isn't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want to get to know you, and you can never be my friend," Brian's voice rang out again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't say that. Maybe we'll be friends tomorrow... If you just got to know me a little better, you'd see that I'm actually quite nice..." The woman wanted to say more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Brian interrupted her coldly, "Get lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Embarrassment and anger flashed across the woman's face. She had only wanted to get to know him because he was handsome, but now she was being humiliated like this. It was a great shame for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's so great about you? You're just good-looking," the woman said angrily. "But your taste in women is really bad. What do you see in her? She's so ugly and poorly dressed. Is she just good in bed or something...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The air around them seemed to change suddenly, and then a slap hit the woman's face hard, causing her to stumble and hit the wall beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman held her burning face with one hand, her face full of disbelief. "You... How dare you hit me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why wouldn't I hit you?" Brian said coldly. "If you stay here any longer, I'll make sure you never speak again!"</p></div>
