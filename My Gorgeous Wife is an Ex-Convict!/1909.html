        <h1>Chapter 1907</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, after she finished speaking, Katherine Jackson suddenly laughed and looked at Lina like she was looking at an idiot. "Why did Hadwin Stephenson fall in love with a fool like you? Do you know why I'm hell-bent on you? It's because you matter so much to Hadwin Stephenson, so I'm getting back at him in this way. I think it&rsquo;ll turn out well. I'd like to see the expression on Hadwin Stephenson's face when he learns that I&rsquo;ve killed you and the baby in your belly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The more Katherine Jackson went on, the more insane and twisted her expression became.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina only felt a chill surging up her body. Katherine Jackson simply wanted her to die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Also... "What do you mean that I matter so much to Hadwin Stephenson? What do you mean by that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson's eyes were full of sarcasm as she looked at Lina. "Do you think Hadwin Stephenson broke up with you just because he wanted the Stephenson family?" She initially thought so as well, but later, she realized Hadwin Stephenson did everything for Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Didn&rsquo;t... he?" Lina asked arduously, only thinking something was about to upend what she had always known.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You almost died when Hadwin Stephenson found you after his two brothers hurt you. He knelt and kowtowed in front of me as he held you, asking me to save you! Do you have any idea how pitiful he looked back then? It's a pity you didn't see it. Tsk, tsk!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson&rsquo;s every word and sentence seemed to prick Lina nerves. 'Did... something like this happen? But Hadwin Stephenson never told me about it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Afterward, I saved you as he wished and kept you alive for a while. I left you on the outskirts of Emerald City, but I wanted him to cut off ties with you from then on. The man I had my eye on couldn&rsquo;t be attached to another woman. Hence, I put a curse on him. It took me a lot of effort to get it from an old Hmong man. I fed the blood curse bug your blood and let him swallow it. Hence, he would experience a heart-wrenching pain whenever he touched you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson's eyes glimmered evilly. She had bad intentions by telling Lina the truth. She just wanted to see Lina in pain and regret!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, Hadwin Stephenson experienced horrific bouts of pain every time he touched you. He struck a deal with me afterward, asking me to get rid of the blood curse in his body so he could spend his life with you. But you didn&rsquo;t believe that he was loyal to you and you mattered more to him than anyone or anything!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson said grimly. She was jealous of Lina, and she showed a satisfied smile on her face when she saw Lina almost breaking down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson said, "Lina, you're a fool. If you weren&rsquo;t stupid enough to force Hadwin Stephenson away, I wouldn't have been able to catch you so easily! Don't worry. Hadwin Stephenson will learn from the news on TV that something has happened to you! And... I can't wait to see the expression on his face!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina paled as tears blurred her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She... had no idea! She had no idea Hadwin had done so much for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had always thought that his career was more important to him and that she was only there to spice up his life. It would be nice to have her around, but he could also easily abandon her for his career one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she never thought that he truly loved her.</p></div>
