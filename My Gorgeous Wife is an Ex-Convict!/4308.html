        <h1>Chapter 4306 Contact</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele and Colin looked at each other upon hearing this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the daughter-in-law, Adele naturally understood the old Mr. Hunter's character and knew that when he said something like this, it was already a decision that wouldn't change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood that the reason the old Mr. Hunter gave Tina this test was because he was afraid that if Tina's love for Chandler wasn't firm enough, it might cause Chandler further harm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in comparison to the danger of Chandler luring out the </span><span>gu</span><span> worms, Adele naturally hoped that Tina could have a second child with her son to relieve his suffering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, all she wished for was that Tina's love for her son was truly as Tina claimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning from the Hunter family, Tina did not go directly back to the Stephenson family. Instead, she came to the Hart family and went straight to find Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you help me make an appointment with Lornell? I have something to discuss with him," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to discuss with Lornell?" Harley asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina didn't hide anything on this matter. "Chandler went to the Quentin family, but outsiders can't enter the Quentin family. If I want to enter the Quentin family, I have to find someone from the Quentin family and ask."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was taken aback. "Chandler went to the Quentin family? What is he doing there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Having grown up in the Hart family, Harley understood that it wasn't something to be taken lightly that Chandler was entering the Quentin family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I'll contact Lornell," Harley said immediately.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was taken aback by his prompt response. "Don't you mind that I didn't tell you the reason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since the reason is inconvenient to disclose, it's fine that you didn't tell me. If you want to enter the Quentin family, I'll help you," Harley smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Tina's face showed shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley said, "Tina, don't be surprised. Actually, we had a good relationship before you lost your memory. You just forgot some things. It's normal for me to help you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," Tina sincerely thanked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also hope that you and Chandler can reconcile. Although I'm not sure what happened, I can sense that you want to go to the Quentin family to be with Chandler, right?" Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at him in surprise. He had already guessed it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" Tina said while asking Harley, "What about you? Have you entered the Quentin family?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley shook his head. "No, the Quentin family is not something you can just enter. Lornell and I are only engaged, not married yet, so I don't have the qualification to enter the Quentin family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was a little surprised. "I didn't expect the Quentin family to be stricter than the Hunter family. I thought you could enter since you're already Lornell's fianc&eacute;."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, when she was Chandler's fianc&eacute;e, she had already been to the Hunter family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But because of her memory loss, this was what she learned from her parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's expression darkened. Yes, even though she was Lornell's fianc&eacute;e, she still couldn't enter the Quentin family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Quentin family, no one would look highly upon her as the fianc&eacute;e. Everyone knew that she had a marriage contract with Lornell only because he was kind and wanted to save her life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina realized that she shouldn't have said that. She hastily said, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say those things, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay!" Harley smiled lightly. "Let me contact Lornell!"</span></p></div>
