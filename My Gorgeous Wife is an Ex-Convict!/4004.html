        <h1>Chapter 4002</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So...they could only wait for the next step?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wait to see what Irene was going to do, or wait for the Reed family to find them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Irene finished her work and walked up to the two of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Have you rested enough, both of you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Irene, what exactly do you want to do?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do I want to do? Of course, I want to get revenge on the Reed family," Irene looked at Jasper with hatred in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This hatred was much greater than the one she had for Nancy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For her, if Jasper hadn't returned to the Reed family, she would still be the well-behaved Miss Reed, and would not have been kicked out of the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So ultimately, all the mistakes were rooted in Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Irene, do you think that if you take revenge on the Reed family, you will be safe?" Jasper said, "If you release me and Nancy now, I will plead with my father, and today's incident will be forgotten. The Reed family can also give you some money to ensure your future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper made a condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Irene just looked at Jasper with a ridiculous look, "Do you think I will believe you? Jasper, you really are a rich girl. Do you think you can just use money to get rid of me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to take revenge on the Reed family, why did you kidnap Nancy? She is not a member of the Reed family, and she and my elder brother have already ended their relationship! You should release her," Jasper pursed his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Blame why Mick had to fall in love with this kind of woman! Even though this woman used him, Mick let her go, but what about me? I just wanted to be closer to him, but why did he treat me like this?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did he make her lose face in front of others, and ruin everything for her in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Neither of you will have a good day today!" Irene said fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, Irene dragged Nancy and Jasper to the edge of the cliff, and warned, "Don't move, you know, I have placed many bombs here, and there are detonation wires buried underground. If you step on the wrong place, you will be blown to pieces!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy and Jasper looked at each other, and finally understood what Irene had been doing just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What...what do you want to do?" Jasper frowned. If Irene wanted money or wanted to harm her and Nancy, it wouldn't be so complicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You'll find out soon enough," Irene said with a sinister smile on her face, her gaze scanning the distance as if waiting for something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half an hour later, several black cars drove up, and when the people got out of the cars, Nancy's pupils suddenly shrank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people who got out of the cars, in addition to some of the Reed family's bodyguards, were Jason and his wife, William, and...Mick!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And at this moment, Mick's gaze was also on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two gazes met in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy felt a complex feeling in her heart. She had repeatedly promised herself that she would not appear in front of him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she had appeared in front of him again and again.</p></div>
