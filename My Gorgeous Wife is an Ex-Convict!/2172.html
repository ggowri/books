        <h1>Chapter 2170</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was a long time before his little body moved. He opened the drawer and took out the piece of paper with his father's phone number on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Maybe it&rsquo;s like what Daddy said. I'll never get what I want if I stay with the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Besides Jasper's smile, I also want...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was late at night when William walked to the living room on the first floor. He picked up the phone and dialed the phone number on the paper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, the call was connected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm William," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Have you made up your mind?" Philip Barlow's voice sounded from the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah," he responded gently in acknowledgment. "I want to return to the Barlow family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, his voice broke as he spoke. Even his eyes seemed to be brimming with tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, my car will be at the entrance of the Reed family&rsquo;s house in half an hour." With that said, Philip Barlow ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William hung up the phone. 'Half an hour. I only have half an hour left?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William went back to his room and looked at the things in the room. None of them belonged to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not bring anything when he came here, so if he was leaving... He hesitated momentarily before taking a doll that Jasper had given him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, he walked quietly to Jasper Reed's room door. He pushed it open and crept in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper was lying on the bed, already asleep. However, there seemed to be tear stains on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Did she... cry? Why did she cry?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked at her quietly. Then, he raised his hand and gently wiped the tears on her face as he said very softly, "Jasper, I'm leaving. I have to leave if I want to get what I want. Once no one will look down on me anymore, I'll..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The rest of his words were muffled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With only one doll, the little one walked out of the mansion and came to Reed Residence's main entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He went up to the gate to push it open. Strangely enough, it was not locked, so he did so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William did not overthink it because he saw a silver-gray car coming in his direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car stopped in front of him, and William saw Philip Barlow getting out of the car to come up to him. "You can't come back again once you've made up your mind. From now on, you're no longer William of the Reed family but William of the Barlow family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William... No, William nodded his little head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow looked at the doll in his son's hand and instantly knew it was a girl's belonging. "Are you going to bring this doll with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He nodded his little head again.</p></div>
