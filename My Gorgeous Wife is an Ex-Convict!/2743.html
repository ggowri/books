        <h1>Chapter 2741</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, thank you," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's there to thank me for? As long as Grace is safe," Valda Theller said sheepishly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she was speaking, a figure hurried over. Jason arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, Grace..." Kyla was about to explain what had happened when Jason said, "You don't need to tell me. I already know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason did not sit on the chair in the corridor but stood at the emergency room door. His face was full of anxiety, unease, and fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was unlike the calm and elegant man who seemed to have everything under control Valda Theller had seen at the banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It must be because... this man loves Grace.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller thought to herself when her phone rang suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at the caller ID and found it was a phone call from Brian, so she quickly walked to the corner of the corridor and answered the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm at your studio. Your two assistants said you went out for lunch. What's the matter? Haven't you finished your lunch?" Brian's voice came from the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm at the hospital," answered Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The hospital? What happened? Are you ill?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not me. It's Grace. I ran into Grace and Kyla at lunch, and&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Valda Theller could finish, Brian's voice came over in a panic. "What? Grace's in the hospital. Which hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This anxious tone was something Valda Theller had never heard before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was hard to imagine a man, who was so cold and indifferent, speaking in such an anxious voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Valda Theller was in a trance, Brian's voice became more impatient. "Hurry and tell me which hospital you're in!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Valda Theller came to her senses and hurriedly said the address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, beeping noises came over the other end of the line, which meant the call was over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not even say goodbye. Valda Theller looked blankly at the phone she was holding. She knew Brian loved Grace, but only then did she realize how real it felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller returned to the emergency room, sat on the chair again, and waited quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She waited for Grace to come out and... Brian's arrival.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was anxious, only feeling her heart beating violently again and again and so fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, the emergency room door opened and the doctor came out. Jason lunged forward, while Kyla and Valda Theller hurriedly followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The baby's alright, but the amniotic fluid's leaking slightly. They need to stay in the hospital for observation tonight. The mother should stay in bed until she gives birth..." the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse wheeled Grace out. Jason looked at Grace nervously. "How are you? Does your belly still hurt?"</p></div>
