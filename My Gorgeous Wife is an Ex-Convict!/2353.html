        <h1>Chapter 2351</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla felt even more guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call with Chase Harper, she called her mother again. "Mom, I won't be coming home today. Something has come up. I'll come back in a few days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why? What happened?" Mrs. Corbyn asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. It's just that I heard there&rsquo;s an old doctor here who's an authority figure on obstetrics and gynecology. I want this doctor to check on the baby and me, but it's hard to get an appointment with the specialist. I can only go home in a few days." She did not want to worry her mother, so she made up a random excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I see..." Mrs. Corbyn did not suspect anything. "Then be careful when you go to the doctor alone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "Got it. Be careful when you take care of Nelson at home alone. If anything happens, ask Grace or Lina for help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it. My old bones can take it. I'll be fine!" Mrs. Corbyn said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The mother and daughter did not want each other to worry after years of supporting each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call with her mother, Kyla put down the phone, only feeling waves of exhaustion coming over her. Perhaps she was exhausted from all that had happened today. In just a while, she fell into a deep sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After an unknown amount of time, the ward door was pushed open, and Martin Weiss entered. Looking at the sleeping Kyla, unnoticeable worry and anxiety flickered in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had gone to the doctor's office when he went through the hospital admission procedures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor had looked at him and said, "Mr. Weiss, your wife isn't doing well. According to her medical history, this is the first time she has suffered from pain like this. She has already undergone liver transplant before this. Although she&rsquo;s been stable for five years, pregnancy is too risky for her, and the pain might become more frequent after this. I don't know what the doctor at her obstetric hospital said, but I recommend an abortion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if we don't go for an abortion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"With your wife's current condition, there's no way she can make it to 32 weeks once she's 28 weeks along. The baby's survival rate is low when they're 28 weeks old. Even if they survive, they might suffer a lot of after-effects. Your wife's body is already under a heavy load. She might not be able to make up for her health in the future even if she survives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor was vague.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss understood what the doctor said. Even if the woman survived until she was seven months along and successfully gave birth, she might not live to a ripe old age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He somehow felt a fit of pain in his heart when that idea crossed his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could she... not live until she was old and gray?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he had forgotten his feelings for her, those memories still existed. He still remembered how she insisted on keeping the baby in front of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss went to the bedside, bent over, and silently watched the sleeping Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not seem to be sleeping well. She frowned as a thin layer of sweat broke out on her forehead. Her pale face and dry lips made her look so pitiful that it affected his emotions again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not help raising his hand to wipe the sweat from her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When his hand pressed gently on her forehead, she suddenly flinched and moved her head from side to side as if she was trying to avoid it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Baby... I... will protect you..." she murmured, her voice sounding panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she having nightmares?' His eyes darkened slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she care about the baby in her belly so much... that she'll risk her life?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not long before she uttered... "Amber Mitchell... Xi... I... I'll find you soon. I... I'll come for you. I... I won't let you suffer..."</p></div>
