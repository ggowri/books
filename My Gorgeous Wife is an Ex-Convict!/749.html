        <h1>Chapter 748</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the end of the day, Hadwin went to pick up Lina. In the car, Lina was still sharing and commenting, trying hard to make the gossip news number one on the trending searches list.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she &lsquo;battled&rsquo; on, Lina did not forget to say, "The Atkinson family is so despicable. They keep removing it from the hot searches. Otherwise, with the comments and shares now, it would&rsquo;ve already been in the trending searches list."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want it to be on the trending searches list?" asked Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, what else am I doing this for?" she grumbled but did not stop what she was doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just putting a piece of news in the trending searches list. Why go through so much trouble?" asked Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I don't work hard, there's no hope at all," Lina said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you know you can pay to put something in the trending searches list?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was shocked by his words that seemed to enlighten her. Then, she raised her head immediately, staring at the man with her bright cat-like eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">God. How could she forget? This man beside her had plenty of money, not to mention anything else! It was a piece of cake for him to pay to make something number one on the trending searches list!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the sake of making it number one on the trending searches list and to continue to step on Lily, Lina immediately put on an obsequious expression. "How about you help me pay to get it on the trending searches list?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why should I? I recall helping you to share this news to my Moments during the day," Hadwin said slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina thought about it and agreed. "What can I do for you to help me get it on the trending searches list?" she asked modestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think you can do right now that would make it worth my while to get it on the trending searches list for you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can give me a beating?" she replied after thinking about it. After all, she thought, 'Isn't he going to get even with me anyway? I might as well let him have some fun with it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin rolled his eyes. What was going on in her head?! Was it impossible for her to see why he was keeping her around and dating her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he turned the wheel and pulled the car over to the side of the road. Then with a click, he unbuckled his seat belt, leaned forward, and kissed her hard on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was a little stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It took her a while to realize that he... Was kissing her! They were just beside the main road!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Come on! People are passing by!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">" Hadwin... Um..." She had just opened her mouth, but he seemed to have swallowed all her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina tried to push him away. Her hands had just moved, but his hands pressed against her wrists, making her unable to move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not fight back!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina accepted the kiss passively. She could only comfort herself, thinking that if someone saw them, she and Hadwin would be embarrassed together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Besides... It feels good to be kissed by him. Since I can&rsquo;t fight back, I might as well enjoy it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, what started as a one-sided kiss gradually became two-sided. After the kiss was over, Lina felt... Um, there was still more to be desired!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, do you really not know what I want?" Hadwin glared at the person under him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was a little stunned. 'What he wants&hellip; Is for me to fall in love with him so that he can kick me aside and get the thrill of revenge, isn&rsquo;t it?'</p></div>
