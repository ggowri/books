        <h1>Chapter 4006</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can listen to you about anything, but not this!" William said resolutely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's tears kept falling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What should she do? Nancy was originally implicated in this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene hates the Reed family the most, it's her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, Irene has given her older brother a choice, but what's in front of her is also a choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Should she sacrifice herself to save Nancy, or selfishly wait for her older brother to choose her and give up Nancy?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her older brother...thinking of this, Jasper's heart tightened again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Nancy used her older brother, and although her older brother has said that Nancy has nothing to do with him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But has her older brother really let go of Nancy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Nancy was the first woman her older brother ever loved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time was passing by second by second.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eight minutes... five minutes... four minutes..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Compared to the excitement of the others, Nancy was the calmest one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her ear, she heard Irene whispering to her, "Why don't you intentionally bump into Jasper now, knock her into the sea, then there won't be a choice to make, and you'll be the only hostage left!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was taken aback for a moment, but soon understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No wonder Irene didn't tie their ankles completely, so they could make some movements if they took small steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene wanted to see if Jasper would really jump, and also wanted to see if Nancy would harm Jasper to save herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you trying to expose the dark side of human nature and prove that others are just as dark as you?" Nancy suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Irene's face was full of anger. "How dare you speak to me like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Actually, from the beginning, there was only one answer, wasn't there? If I were chosen to live, then you couldn't escape. The so-called two choices were just for you to see how we would behave in an ugly way!" Nancy said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene's face suddenly changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Indeed, as Nancy said, she had already seen Nancy as a dead person from the beginning!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The reason for posing the multiple-choice question was just her sadistic taste!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy turned her head and looked at the man still kneeling on the ground in the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His forehead was covered in blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he was trying to save his sister, at least... he brought her along, didn't he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She should be content!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the last moment of her life, she could still see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's just a pity that both she and he were in such a miserable state for this last moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mick, do you remember what I said to you under the wishing tree?" Nancy shouted loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's body suddenly stiffened. She said, "If one day you need help, even if it means going through fire and water, I will repay you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His pupils suddenly shrank. Does this mean she's going to...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mick, thank you!" The last three words, "thank you," she said silently with her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then her fingertips suddenly grabbed Irene's clothes next to her, pulled hard, and her body fell straight back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Behind her was a cliff, and below the cliff was the sea!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her body weight caused Irene to fall with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene let out a sharp scream, "Let go, Nancy, let go... I let go of you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it was too late. The two figures fell off the cliff like this.</p></div>
