        <h1>Chapter 1329</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Chase Harper turned to leave, Kyla Corbyn's eyes were still staring at his back as if she was sighing over something or recalling something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not until Chase Harper got in the car and drove out of the neighborhood that Kyla Corbyn turned around. She walked in the direction of her motorcycle stall. She had only taken a few steps when the sound of footsteps hurriedly approached her. The next moment, someone seized one of her arms and she was turned around with a pull.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that the man you're going to start a new life with?" Martin Weiss's voice reached Kyla Corbyn's ears with thick sarcasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, his stern and cold face caught her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A touch of surprise flashed across Kyla Corbyn's eyes when she saw the impeccably attired Martin Weiss. "What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Shouldn't I be here?" Martin Weiss asked coldly. His long eyebrows were slightly furrowed, and his face was full of displeasure. The thought that she had been staring into the eyes of that ordinary-looking man while smiling filled him with dread.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She never smiles like that in front of me, but she smiled at the plain-looking man. Did she give up custody for that man?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla Corbyn, are you that desperate for men? As long as a man gives you the slightest hint of affection, you just can't wait to abandon your son to get married, huh? You even plan to give that man a child, don&rsquo;t you?"Martin Weiss asked sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every word he said seemed to strike her with something sharp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn quietly looked at the man in front of her. She raised her free hand and touched her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It doesn't hurt. It turns out what he says can't hurt me anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It doesn't hurt because I've put it all behind me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How nice. It turns out when you stop loving someone, whatever he says won't hurt you anymore.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said lightly, "Mr. Weiss, I thought we had reached an agreement that day. These three months will be my time with my son, so please don't disturb me. I'll naturally hand Nelson to you in three months, and I promise I'll never show up in front of you and Nelson again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the more indifferent she was, the more distressed he became. Even her calmness seemed particularly unpleasant to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Agreement?" He suddenly snorted coldly. "Since you said it was an agreement, a mere verbal statement is no guarantee. You ought to write it down for it to take effect."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn pondered a little and said, "Okay, I'll draft a written agreement later, stamp my thumbprint on it, and send it to you by express."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want it now!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." She frowned, finding him being pushy at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Since you're abandoning your son, is it that hard to give me an agreement? The house you're renting is just upstairs, isn't it? Then let's just go to your place. I'll take the agreement with me after you've written it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn took a deep breath. "Are you going to leave me alone for these three months if I write the agreement for you today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word &lsquo;disturb&rsquo; seemed to have triggered Martin Weiss. He glared at her. "Kyla Corbyn, who are you for me to 'disturb'? Just because you're a woman who has been to prison and is hooking up with men everywhere?"</p></div>
