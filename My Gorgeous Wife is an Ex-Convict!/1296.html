        <h1>Chapter 1295</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting in the car, Jason took the prescription in Grace's hand. He pondered for a while and said, "I'll have someone check this prescription out later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you afraid there's something wrong with it?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whether or not there's something wrong with it, it's always good to be careful," said Jason. He was nervous about everything when it came to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace's hand and looked down at it as he spoke. Her fingers were just as slender as her figure, but the deformation of her joints was also more obvious because of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt a fit of pain in his heart every time he saw her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt remorseful, regretful, and even helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was wealthy and could get anything he wanted easily. However, he seemed helpless with her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he had found her many relevant specialists, they concluded they could only relieve the pain in her hands. They could not get her hands to perform delicate movements as easily as a normal person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she chose to treat them after a year, he would never forgive himself if anything happened to her hands. He would rather not have his three children than have her hands become crippled!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you continue with the treatment... What if&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" Grace immediately refused. "The treatment will affect the babies and cause me to miscarry easily. I won't risk it. I finally managed to get pregnant with these babies, and I'll see to it that they're born safely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if you can no longer hold a pen or write with these hands, or even hold a glass of water?" he asked. The anxiety welled up in him just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she replied gently and took his big hand in her palms. "Jay, I've already thought of what would happen if my hands became crippled. Speaking of which, my hands were supposed to be crippled back then. I'm lucky to have them recover to the way they are now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked grave, and there was great pain in his eyes. She had no idea that every word she said now was deepening his remorse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are the kids... that important?" "Jason murmured after a long while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said gently, "They're very important to me. Because they're our children... After they're born, I'll give them lots of love. I can teach them to sing, tell them stories, and watch cartoons with them. There are still many things I can do even if I lose my hands."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyelashes trembled slightly as he slowly raised his eyes to look at her. There seemed to be a stir in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore... she was mentally prepared to sacrifice her hands for the children!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like how she was willing to bet on her life for the three little ones in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She would do that for the children?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, I want our children to be happy." Her voice rang in his ears, and she smiled unflinchingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Our children... She's different from Mother, after all.' He stared blankly at the woman in front of him. His mother had easily abandoned him and his father because she could not stand being poor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he had pleaded with her and almost died after getting pushed by his mother, he still could not stop her from leaving.</p></div>
