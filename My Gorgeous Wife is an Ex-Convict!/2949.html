        <h1>Chapter 2947</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was stunned, her face filled with his breath, their foreheads touching and their noses almost touching each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So intimate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This man took a knife for her, yet he still said "fortunately".</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could she not love him, with him being like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She couldn't help but raise her hand, wrap it around his neck, and kiss his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body trembled slightly, then he wrapped his arms around her waist and kissed her back passionately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I'm not sure how long they kissed, but when Valda wanted to pull away satisfied, he grabbed the back of her head. "Valda, not enough yet..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As his voice trailed off, his lips once again landed on hers, as if wanting to savor every inch of sweetness and not willing to let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um..." Valda passively endured the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, his kiss was even more dominant and intense than before, making her almost unable to catch her breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt dizzy and when the kiss ended, she was panting and her face felt hot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I really don't want to let you go like this," he murmured, his fingers lightly touching her lips, his phoenix eyes stained with some kind of desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's face turned even redder... "You, you still have an injury. The doctor said you can't do strenuous exercise," she quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But as soon as the words were out, she wanted to bite her own tongue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Oh my god, what did she just say? It sounded like she was implying that if he wasn't injured, they could do "strenuous exercise"!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, not now, we'll have to wait until later," he replied seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt like her face was about to boil over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I'm going back first. You, you rest well!" Her face turned red as she spoke, and she wanted to turn around to get her own bag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But as she took only one step forward, his hand suddenly pulled her closer into his embrace. "Don't go, stay with me tonight...please?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh? But you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, I won't do anything. I just want you to stay with me, just to keep me company. I won't do anything to you." He leaned in close to her ear and whispered softly, "Today, you finally agreed to be with me again. I'm afraid it's all just my imagination because everything happened so suddenly, it doesn't feel real."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he's holding her like this right now, and she's gently snuggling in his arms, that unreal feeling still lingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Is it because he really wants to be with her? It seems like only when he's with her, he can find redemption and truly relax.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lower lip slightly and after a while, she softly said "okay".</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Valda didn't bring any clean clothes, Brian has plenty here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During the time she lived in this villa before, Brian had someone buy a lot of clothes in her size. However, when she left, she only took her own clothes and left all the ones he bought here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It fits perfectly now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to his wound, Brian is unable to take a shower or bath for the time being and can only clean himself by wiping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This task was originally meant to be done by a caregiver, but Brian looked at her with his beautiful eyes and said, "Do you really want another woman to help me bathe?"</p></div>
