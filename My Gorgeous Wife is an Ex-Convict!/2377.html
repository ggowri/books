        <h1>Chapter 2375</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman clenched her teeth, threw caution to the wind, and said to her fellow passengers who had not left the plane, "The police are arresting people arbitrarily! The police are arresting people arbitrarily!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she could save herself by using public opinion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to her surprise, those passengers seemed unbothered by what was happening. Although some people looked curiously toward her, no one took out their phones to record the scene, let alone come over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's no use, Jacqueline Bowman. Others will only think it's for show. These passengers are extras who accompanied you on the flight. They were asked to put on a show to make you think you were flying abroad." Grace's statement instantly solved Jacqueline Bowman's doubts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Extras?" She froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, just like the trial you went through, which was also for show. Your real trial is in a month. You're still a suspect. You&rsquo;ll be sentenced in a month," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was stupefied for a long time. 'How can this all be for show?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she got away on probation! However, they were now telling her that her real trial was another month away,</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no way she would be released on probation during her trial next month! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, well! Y-You lied to me! You lied to me!" Jacqueline Bowman said in a shrill voice, desperately trying to break away from the police officers holding her down. She wanted to run toward Grace and hit her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not move at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more she tried to break free, the more she was restrained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said coldly, "Didn't you lie to Kyla too? I'm only glad I didn't let someone like you escape abroad!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman could only shout at Kyla, "Kyla, I... I didn't lie to you. I really know where Amber Mitchell is. Tell them to let me go. I... I'll tell you where Amber Mitchell is!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla would no longer believe her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not going to be a fool anymore and believe that you know where Amber Mitchell is!&rdquo; Kyla seemed tired. It was as if she had exhausted all her energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come on, Kyla. I'll send you home so you can rest," said Grace as she held Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as they were about to return to the car, Jacqueline Bowman suddenly shouted, "Kyla, do you have the heart to let Amber Mitchell live a life worse than death in a mental hospital? Don't you want to save her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla instantly paused and looked at Jacqueline Bowman in shock. "What... What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I can tell you where she is. I&rsquo;ll tell you if you set me free!" Jacqueline Bowman said desperately, but she was pulled into the police car that slowly drove away from the airport.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla subconsciously wanted to go after her. Grace forcibly grabbed her hand and said, "Kyla, don't worry. If you want to know whether she's telling the truth, we only have to check all the mental hospitals to find out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla paused and came back to her senses. She heard Grace say, "If Amber Mitchell has been admitted to a mental hospital, there would be records we can check. If we fail to find anything, Jacqueline Bowman is probably just lying to take advantage of your desire to find Amber Mitchell."</p></div>
