        <h1>Chapter 2713</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It took a long while for Mrs. Weiss to say, "Are you telling the truth this time? You won't go back on your word like you did then, will you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla knew Mrs. Weiss was referring to the fact that she had promised to separate with Martin Weiss in the hospital back then. However, she eventually came to L City to look for Martin again. She did it for Amber Mitchell and hoped Martin could drop the lawsuit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss gazed at Kyla. "I'll trust you one last time. I hope you won't disappoint me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said nothing more but looked up toward the stairs, waiting for Martin Weiss to appear. Every extra glance she got of him was a blessing for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to see more of him and imprint his face in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, his figure came into view.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A black suit enveloped his figure, which was much slimmer than before. He walked down the steps with a straight back and graceful steps. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His neatly combed hair looked meticulous when coupled with his handsome but solemn face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss walked to the living room, Shana Nicholls stepped forward, held him, and said to Mrs. Weiss, "Old Madam, don't worry. I'll take good care of Mr. Weiss at the banquet tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, pay attention to when Martin needs to take his medicines. Don't let him exhaust himself. Call me if anything happens," said Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss bade goodbye to his mother and left the mansion with Shana Nicholls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla helplessly watched the two walk past her. Her eyes were full of reluctance as she wanted to reach out to grab him. She wanted to tell him to accompany her a little while longer because she was never going to have that kind of company again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she eventually did nothing but watch...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She watched his figure disappear from her sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not long after, Mrs. Weiss left too. Before she left, she stared at Kyla again and said, "I only want my son to be safe for the rest of his life, but he&rsquo;ll never be safe with you. I hope you can let him live because he donated his liver to you twice!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All Kyla could say was... "I will! I hope he can be safe too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was the only one left in the living room, she checked her phone and found online that he had gone to a well-known charity event in L City that evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some comments online said his attendance at the charity event had dispelled the rumors that the head of the Weiss Group was seriously ill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were some live videos taken by others online. Kyla found the ones about Martin Weiss and clicked on them to watch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though he looked thin in the video, he appeared to be in good spirits and was laughing with people. Shana Nicholls was by his side, her face looking a little shy and lovely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Comments below the video speculated about the relationship between Shana Nicholls and Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching the video, Kyla's eyes felt sore as if tears would pour out at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not be the one who accompanied him in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He might be with Shana Nicholls or some other woman, but... there would not be any room for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ending the marriage and returning to Emerald City might be the best for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Turning off her phone, she sat in the living room and waited in silence. The minutes ticked by and she did not know how long she had waited until she heard something. She got up and looked at the main building's entrance.</p></div>
