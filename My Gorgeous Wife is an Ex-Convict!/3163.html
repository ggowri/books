        <h1>Chapter 3161</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he returned to the bedroom, he found the light on and Kyla still awake, sitting on the bed and scrolling through her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Have you finished your work?" Kyla lifted her head and looked towards Martin as if she had heard footsteps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah, I'm done. What about you? What are you watching?" he approached and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm looking at some photos taken tonight, it's been a long time since so many people gathered together like this," Kyla said with a smile. "When our children are a little older, we can probably form a soccer team with all of them if we bring them all together like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't help but be a little distracted by the smile that appeared on her lips. In his memory, she rarely smiled so effortlessly and naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems that between them, since he misunderstood her and caused her to be imprisoned years ago, she rarely relaxes and laughs so naturally in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin approached and looked at the photos on Kyla's phone screen that were taken at today's gathering. These photos were indeed very heartwarming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she said that when the children are a little older... does that mean she still wants to be with him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kyla, do you feel good about your life now?" Martin asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla's body tensed slightly, and she looked up at Martin, seemingly contemplating the meaning behind his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We all know that our current way of life is a result of your desire to prevent the company from suffering losses due to our marriage. Therefore, we have to maintain a false image of a loving couple in front of others. But... do you intend to continue living like this indefinitely? Or have you been thinking about when it will end?" He almost had to gather all his courage to ask this question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla stared at the man in front of her, and tonight he brought up a question that they had both silently avoided until now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what about you? What do you think?" she replied with a question instead of an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin pursed his thin lips and said, "I think living like this is also good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since it's good, then..." she paused and said, "let's just leave it at that for now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So you also feel that we may not be able to live like this forever, right?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She remained silent, but her expression confirmed that he had guessed correctly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin combed his hair with his fingers, let out a bitter smile. He realized that he wasn't the only one who felt this way, Kyla felt the same. "Kyla, I used to think that I could never live a peaceful life like yours, but reality has shown me that it's possible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong with you? What do you want to say?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to ask you, if I want to live like this with you forever, would you be willing?" He stared at her and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She paused, with a hint of surprise in her eyes, "Forever?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, until one of us reaches the end of our life and leaves this world, we will be together. Are you willing?" he asked, with a serious expression.</p></div>
