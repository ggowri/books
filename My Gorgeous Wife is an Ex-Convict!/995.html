        <h1>Chapter 994</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pain in his stomach finally began to subside after some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason slowly stood up, got out of bed, and came to Grace's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Her breathing is even. She must have fallen asleep.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He bent down, swallowed the discomfort, and picked her up gently. He put her back on the bed before pulling the covers over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes rested firmly on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thought that crossed his mind just now was... If it was really over between them, then he would die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would no longer have a reason to stay alive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A self-mocking smile appeared on his lips. 'It turns out she has always been&hellip; in charge of my life!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought he could control his life and stop being affected by her after the breakup. He did not want to repeat his father's mistake&mdash;giving up his life because of a woman's betrayal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the end... He had always loved her. He never stopped loving her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was only lying to himself by saying that he did not love her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence came to Grace's rental house early the next morning to pick Jason up after receiving a call from his boss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Terrence gasped hard after seeing the red mark on his boss' face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That red mark... It's probably&hellip; a slap if I'm not mistaken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did Grace slap Master Reed?' The fact alone surprised Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Few people in Emerald City dare to slap Master Reed. If it were someone else, they would be suffering so much at this moment that they&rsquo;d rather choose death. They wouldn&rsquo;t hope to remain in Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, if it was Grace who did this... then she should be alright.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Grace's friend, Lina, had slapped Master Reed in the face last time and she was fine. What more Grace herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed's ruthlessness would diminish when it came to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go," Jason said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Terrence quickly responded and started the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The black Bentley slowly drove away from the neighborhood. Jason leaned back on the seat and closed his eyes as if he was exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The fact dawned on him when he had sat on the edge of the bed last night, watching her sleeping face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though they had broken up, he was still in love with her, so he could not stand her falling for another man. He was also scared now that Brian had fallen in love with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I afraid that she'll fall in love with Brian one day?'</p></div>
