        <h1>Chapter 115</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"People can't help but want to protect her at all costs."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Too many people call me cruel and cold-blooded, and yet they would never expect that I want to protect her."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's okay. The thing you feared would happen didn't happen last night. When I rushed over, it was just in time," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It really is him... who saved me!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace raised her head and dazedly stared at the face that was inches away from her. "But why did you go there to save me?" She thought to herself, "He didn't even come with me to town yesterday!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sister, did you forget? You called me and I rescued you," he replied with a faint smile. "Luckily, I got there in time."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"After only a phone call, he was able to travel more than a hundred kilometers just in time to save me?!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace felt an indescribable shock coursing through her heart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He spoke as he carried her to the bed and carefully tucked her under the covers. "Your hand was cut by the mirror shard. It'll probably take a few days for it to heal. If there's a scar, I'll find the best doctors to remove it for you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only then did Grace notice that her right hand was bandaged in a layer of gauze. She had been so distracted by the many shocking revelations that she had not realized that there was a dull pain in her right hand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How much of yesterday do you remember, Sister?" Jason asked with a serious expression.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace bit her lip lightly and did not try to hide the events that had happened the night before during the dinner, relaying everything to Jason without reservation.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason's expression darkened. "Her relatives are truly... they sold her to a fool! They sure have guts!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If anyone dares to scheme against her, I will never let them get away!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, Jason's phone suddenly rang and he frowned as he glanced at the caller ID. He then turned to Grace and said, "I lied to you when I hid my identity from you. You can have me apologize to you in any way you like, but now that you're hospitalized, you should take good care of yourself. I'll go and get the doctor."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Jason was done talking, he left the room and gave instructions to Terrence, who had been keeping watch outside. "Grace has already woken up. Call for the doctor to check on her condition."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only after he had finished giving orders did he answer the call. Mr. Reed's voice rang at the other end of the phone. "Why did you take so long to pick up?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm a little busy," Jason replied calmly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is it related to the woman you saved last night?" Mr. Reed asked frankly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason was not surprised that the Old Master had found out about last night's incident. After all, he had been pressed for time the night before and had informed the town's police beforehand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had mobilized their forces, and members of the Miller family and Grace's relatives were still locked up in the small town's police station. It had been easy for the Old Master to investigate the matter due to the paper trail left behind.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What is your current relationship with this woman?" The tone of the Old Master's voice had gone cold.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She's someone I'm protecting," Jason replied lazily, "so you shouldn't touch her."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't forget how your father died!" The Old Master suddenly raised his voice. "Do you want to follow in your father's footsteps?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason's expression darkened instantly. "Dad's past has always been a taboo to me!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I didn't forget," Jason replied coldly. "Grandpa, I'm not like Father. I would never risk everything for a woman, so you don't have to worry too much!"</p></div>
