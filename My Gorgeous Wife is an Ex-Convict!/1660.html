        <h1>Chapter 1658</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So how can I make it even? Do you want me to sleep with you? Or do you want me to be in another imaginary relationship with you? You can have any woman you want. Why do you have to make it seem as if I'm the only one you want? That&rsquo;s simply not true. You wouldn't have broken up with me if so," she said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What am I to you?" he asked as he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She met his eyes. "A man I once loved but won't anymore. Because I can suffer some things once but not a second time. You're highly career-driven. You want success and power, but I just want to stay with my husband and children to live a calm, ordinary life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They grew up in different environments, so their relationship had been doomed to fail from the beginning!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson slowly got up when he heard that. One step, two steps... he slowly retreated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The moonlight shone on him through the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His face was half-lit by the moonlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're right. I can have any woman I want, so why does it have to be you?" He looked down with a small smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It&rsquo;s been five years. Five years of planning to finally drive the Jackson family up against the wall, but it has also... erased me from her heart little by little.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a smile on his lips, but it seemed to her as if he was crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina only felt a pang of pain in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Stop! Stop feeling hurt for him! Haven't I decided to get over this man for good? Then I shouldn&rsquo;t let him affect me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina told herself, but she could not take her eyes off his face. The pain in her heart still came in waves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson did not give Lina a second look and silently walked out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Only when Lina was left alone in the room did she finally stop pretending to be strong. The fragility and pain on her face were things Hadwin Stephenson had never seen before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next day, the Sweeney family were told they could go home anytime they wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was momentarily stunned. 'I... can go home now?' She had been looking forward to it, but when she was actually told that she could go home, her heart seemed to be filled with emotions that she could not explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Leaving here and returning home meant that all this was over. She would no longer have anything to do with Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had refused him the night before. Was this not what she wanted?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Sweeney, do you want to go home today?" asked the bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Sweeney family discussed it for a while, and Lina said, "Yes, we want to go home today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, I'll arrange a car to take you home later," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Sweeney family packed up their things. An hour later, the black car they were in drove toward their neighborhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was another car following them. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson had followed them all the way here. His car stopped in the shadows on the other side of the road as the car in front stopped at the gates. He watched the Sweeney family get out of the car and walk into the neighborhood.</p></div>
