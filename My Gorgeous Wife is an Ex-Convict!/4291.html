        <h1>Chapter 4289 Not Going to Be Happy</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley also smiled, "So if I don't like you anymore, you won't uphold this engagement, right?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, let's talk about it when you don't like me anymore." He said, reaching out to rub her head. "What on earth is going on in that head of yours?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley didn't say anything more, just kept her head down.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's going on... she's thinking about how to make him like her, thinking that even though they have an engagement, it seems like no matter what she does, she can't bridge the distance between them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he doesn't like her, he can still fulfill this engagement.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But is this the kind of marriage she really wants?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The marriage she imagines is like her parents' marriage, warm and loving.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a glance, they can understand each other's thoughts, and sometimes, even during arguments, there's a sweet atmosphere in the air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mother's legs are not good, so father often massages her legs. Even though the father can be stern and cold outside, when facing the mother, he becomes gentle and takes care of her meticulously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She envies this kind of love, but deep down she also understands that maybe she will never have this kind of love in her lifetime.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car arrived at the entrance of the Hart family mansion, and Harley got out of the car. "Goodbye."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, goodbye," Lornell said casually, bidding her farewell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car quickly drove away from the Hart family mansion. Harley entered the house and saw her mother sketching in the living room, while her father casually sat, flipping through books.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They just sat there, but it felt like a warm breeze was surrounding them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Without even looking at her mother's sketchbook, she knew that her mother must be drawing her father.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had once curiously asked, "Mom, you always draw Dad, don't you get tired of it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And her mother's reply was, "No, not at all. I still feel like I can't capture him enough."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But painting the same face over and over again, isn't it all the same?" If all the portraits her mother had done of her father were stacked up, they could probably fill a warehouse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you truly love someone, you will never feel it's enough," her mother said with a smile. "And I love your father very, very much."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How envious she was...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Harley once again sighed with such emotion in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley, you're back. Have you had dinner?" Valda looked up at her daughter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I've eaten," Harley replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you eat with your classmates?" Brian asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I ate with Lornell," Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at his daughter and suddenly asked, "Did something unhappy happen to you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was startled. "No, nothing happened."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there's something unhappy, just tell your parents. Even if you have an engagement with the Quentin family, there is still room for remorse," Brian said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley understood her father's meaning: "Dad, it's always said that love is between two people, but can a marriage last if only one person loves?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her sudden question surprised Valda.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian, however, seemed unsurprised as he said, "Maybe it can, maybe it can't. After all, there are so many people in this world, and each person's marriage is different. But I think the person who loves will never feel happy. Even if such a marriage lasts until old age, it will never truly be happy."</span></p></div>
