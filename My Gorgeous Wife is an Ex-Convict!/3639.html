        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, he's currently playing the piano for the children," the person replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jasper followed the person to the room with the piano, she saw Roger sitting in front of the piano, playing Mozart's 12 Variations on "Ah, vous dirai-je maman," K.265/300e. Many children were sitting around him, softly humming along to his music.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>12 Variations on "Ah, vous dirai-je maman" is widely known by many people, and even those who haven't studied piano much can play it with the sheet music. But when Roger plays it, there's a certain infectious quality to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Often, the most important thing in piano performance is this infectious quality, where the listeners unconsciously feel the influence of the music and have their emotions stirred by the notes played by the performer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper stood there, listening attentively, while William, standing beside her, watched her focused expression and then shifted his gaze to Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he hadn't personally taken the other person's blood sample to the lab for testing, he might have even thought that Roger was Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The DNA shows that they are not the same person, but why did Roger have contact with Harold and Camelia? It's even possible that these two people coming to Emerald City have some connection to Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What is Roger really up to?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There is a lingering unease in William's heart, as he can't help but feel that this Roger might be his biggest threat in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a piano piece came to an end, Roger, who had been playing in front of the piano, seemed to sense something and turned his head to look towards Jasper and William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then a smile appeared on the corner of his lips as he stood up and walked towards the two of them, "What a coincidence, I didn't expect to run into you here today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It is quite a coincidence. Do you often come here to see these children?" Jasper asked. She had also met Roger here last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The children in the welfare home are all orphans. They are already owed by the world. If I can bring them some happiness, why wouldn't I do it?" Roger said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was taken aback for a moment. He didn't expect him to say such words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Speaking of which, congratulations to both of you. I didn't expect that in such a situation, you two would decide to be together. These days, everyone at school is talking about you. They're saying how lucky Barlow is to have turned the tables. Did Barlow already anticipate this kind of luck?" Roger hinted, "If Barlow doesn't understand, he should ask the person who said these things. I'm just passing on the message."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William looked at Roger, "I am indeed fortunate. As for what I had already anticipated, I don't understand the meaning of that statement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger shrugged indifferently, "It's just a joke among some people at school. If Barlow doesn't understand, then he should ask the ones who said it. I'm just relaying the message."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two men confronted each other. The staff members who had brought Jasper and the children had already gathered the kids. When the children saw Jasper, their faces lit up with big smiles. "Jasper is here!"</span></p></div>
