        <h1>Chapter 879</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis, you'd better not say these words in my presence from now on. Since you're Grandma's granddaughter too, I'll have to warn you, Brian is not as easy to fool as you think. Sometimes, you'll only lose everything if you're too greedy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Grace got up, paid for her cup of coffee, and left the cafe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella sat in the same spot and tried to calm herself with her cup of coffee, but she was shaking so much that she could not even lift the cup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What should I do? Grace has gotten her memory back! If Grace tells Brian&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, no! I must find a way so that even if Grace does tell him, Brian wouldn't believe her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I must... think of something!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace came out of the cafe, she took the bus to the place where Mrs. Corbyn and Nelson were now renting. She saw Kyla there, and they were packing up their things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Nelson saw Grace, he jumped into her arms happily and told Grace that he could go to kindergarten after the summer was over!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you found him a kindergarten?" asked Grace as she looked at Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I've found one. The principal of a kindergarten over there is so kind. She found out about Nelson's situation, and after a video chat with Nelson, she said she could let him join her kindergarten," Kyla said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They finally had a piece of good news after days!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When are you going to move to G City? Do you have a date?" Grace asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"After half a month. I'm looking for a moving company these two days. I'll let you know when we&rsquo;ve fixed a date," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After hearing the news of their move to G City, the little one's excited expression turned to a listless look as his little head drooped down. "Will you miss me when you can no longer see me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace kissed the little one on the cheek. "Of course, I'll miss you. Besides, I can still see you. We can video chat, and when I'm free, I'll go to G City to visit you. I want to take you to the amusement park again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one's face finally brightened a little at the mention of the amusement park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will Uncle Harper come with us next time?" The little one had a good impression of Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated for a moment. It was as if she did not know how to answer that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla saw her dilemma and interjected, saying, "It depends on whether Uncle Harper is free."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing that, Nelson nodded his little head and said, "Then we can go together when Uncle Harper is free!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you like Uncle Harper so much, Nelson?" asked Grace.</p></div>
