        <h1>Chapter 218</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone around was in an uproar while some looked at Evelyn sympathetically. They were convinced that Evelyn's shelf life as Brian&rsquo;s girlfriend had reached its end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The prince was more interested in that extra playing a servant girl!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not far away, Lily, who was enjoying the show, was stunned. Grace and Brian? What was going on here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was Brian also interested in Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian clearly looked like he was trying to protect Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What about Jason? Did he know about Brian and Grace's relationship?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh my God, what a turn of events. The prince and the extra..." her assistant beside her exclaimed and then sneered. "Evelyn has just hit a snag. The crown prince obviously hasn't dumped her! Is it because she knows that the extra has something to do with the prince, so she deliberately pranked her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The assistant guessed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily, however, drooped her eyes and seemed to be thinking of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Evelyn who had been standing absent-mindedly where she was, she began to come back to her senses. With the sympathetic and mocking gazes around her, she felt as if she had been slapped in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was supposed to be popular, right? It was only right to have countless envious and jealous eyes focusing on her, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, why was everyone looking at her as if they were looking at a clown?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if all her glory had vanished in an instant. It was as if she was only a pitiful creature in their eyes now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was almost ready to scream that she was Brian's real girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not shout at all. She only left in a hurry with her face flushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The assistant director looked blankly at the director. "What... should we do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How were they going to shoot the film today when Evelyn was, after all, the second female lead? Unfortunately, this was related to the prince.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would dare to get involved in this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director could only heave a heavy sigh and said, "Let's shoot the scenes without Evelyn first!" What else could they do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was in pain and embarrassed when she was being carried to the lounge by Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand was in pain, and she was embarrassed because she was being carried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pain in her hand made it impossible for her to push him off. She could only say to him, "I hurt my hand, not my foot. I can walk on my own."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know," he answered her lightly but kept on carrying her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was also a little speechless.</p></div>
