        <h1>Chapter 941</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now that I've made this decision, there's nothing to regret!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Besides, my marriage to Lily would be the best for the Stevens family!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let's go over there and say hello to President Wang and the rest," said Sean, trying to stop the quarrel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Zoe did not want to let it go. "Brother, what do you mean? Can you stand Grace insulting the Atkinson family? Can't you stand up for Lily?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you forgotten your lesson?" Sean snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's because she had Jason back then, but now she has broken up with him. Speaking of which, she's just a worn wh*re now," Zoe spoke loudly, wanting everyone around them to hear her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, everyone had turned to look at the scene. There were even a few sympathetic and curious looks, but Zoe did not think much of it. She just thought the crowd was sympathizing with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoe became more enthusiastic as she spoke, "Jason's weird too. He was interested in a woman you dumped. Amazingly enough, he lost interest in the worn wh*re. Grace, I heard you were on your knees in prison, licking and eating leftovers like a dog. Why don't you perform&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could finish, someone slapped her in the face. Zoe fell to the ground and subconsciously covered her cheek. It took a while before she came to her senses. "Who was it? Who dares to slap me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoe shouted. Her mouth and cheeks were tingling with pain as she spoke while her face burned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She came to this banquet with her brother and future sister-in-law, wanting to see if there was anyone suitable for her in the upper-class. After all, her dating life had suffered after she became a cripple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She refused to compromise and marry someone ordinary. The husbands of her friends were all rich and powerful or at least had hundreds of millions of dollars worth of fortune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, to be slapped on the ground in such a manner was nothing short of humiliating for her. How could she hope to leave a good impression on the single men at this banquet now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that the Stevens family don't remember their lessons." The elegant voice, accompanied by its bleak tone, immediately made Zoe shudder. Then, she caught sight of a tall figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's&hellip;' Zoe's pupils immediately constricted as she looked at the man in surprise. It was Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason did not even bother looking at her. He just glanced at Sean and Lily before asking Grace, "Did they do anything to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His tone was completely different from what it was before. It was gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We just chatted a little," Grace replied in a soft voice. Zoe's vicious remarks did not affect her at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Sean and Lily knew that Grace still shared a relationship with Jason after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whether or not they had broken up, Jason was still Grace's backup!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With Jason around, no one could lay a hand on Grace.</p></div>
