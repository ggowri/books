        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It does seem fast." Lina touched her stomach before looking at Kyla. She asked, "By the way, Kyla, is Nelson doing okay? Are there any other kids at school who are picking on him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He's doing okay. I don't think he gets bullied at school anymore. After you backed him up, the principal and teachers learned that he has the Reed family and the Stephenson family supporting him. So they're cautious with him!" said Kyla. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's good," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The three chatted as they ate. When talking about Chase Harper's daughter Juliet Harper, Lina also said she would like to see the adorable child after giving birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the waiter served a plate of beef entrails. Lina said, "Hey, try this out. Beef entrails are this restaurant's specialty. I didn't like them before, but now I love them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The spicy smell rushed to the tip of her nose, and Kyla suddenly felt nauseous. She instantly got up, covered her mouth, and hurried toward the washroom in the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla bent over the sink as she threw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After some time, she had thrown up everything she ate and felt a little better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After rinsing her mouth, she looked up at her pale face. She took a breath, cleaned herself up, and left the washroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, what was that? Are you not feeling well?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's just that... the beef entrails smell a little intense. I suddenly had the urge to throw up. It's nothing. I think it's because I haven't had spicy food in a long time," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If the smell is intense, let's take it away," Lina said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, I feel much better now. You should continue eating. I'll just watch you eat," Kyla said quickly. Lina loved the dish and had recommended it to everyone, after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the meal was over, the three walked out of the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina suddenly trembled and stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter?" Grace and Kyla also stopped and looked at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She seemed a little pale as her hands covered her bulging belly with a deep frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The baby's kicking hard. It's a little different than usual," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The baby usually would not kick this hard. They kept kicking, making her uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Kyla froze. Having the baby kicking abnormally in the third trimester was never a good thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said to Lina, "Let's go to the hospital! I'll drive you there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, a tall figure and another short figure headed toward Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was a middle-aged man in his 30 and a little boy who looked to be about seven or eight years old. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy was good-looking. He was like a flash of bright color. He stood out in the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He already looked like this when he was young. Who knew how good-looking he would be when he grew up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The boy walked up to Lina. His beautiful eyes stared at Lina's bulging belly closely as if he was looking at something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and her friends did not have time to bother about the strange child. Grace said to Kyla, "I'll go get my car. Wait here with Lina."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay!" responded Kyla.</p></div>
