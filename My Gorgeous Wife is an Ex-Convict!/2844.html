        <h1>Chapter 2842</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, she could find ways to mock the portrait. What Valda Theller did today would then become a joke!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross looked confident. Just then, someone suddenly called out, "100 million dollars!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross raised her head in amazement and looked at Brian not far away in disbelief. He... called for 100 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller choked on her own saliva. '100 million dollars? Did I hear him wrong, or did he make a slip of the tongue?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The auctioneer on stage was shocked by the figure of 100 million dollars. After a while, they finally said, "Mr. Hart offered 100 million dollars. Is there a higher offer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone was silent. Buying an unpopular comic artist&rsquo;s work for 100 million dollars? It was not like money grew on trees!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A-Are you crazy?" Valda Theller muttered as she tugged on Brian next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You drew a portrait of me, so the price is right," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Hart family was going to donate money to charity anyway, so it's perfect," he said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"100 million dollars going once... 100 million dollars going twice... 100 million dollars going thrice..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the mallet dropped with a thump, the portrait was sold for 100 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone also focused on Brian and Valda Theller. They only thought Brian must dote on Valda Theller very much. Otherwise, why would he spend 100 million dollars on Valda Theller's portrait?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross's expression was distorted. The 100 million dollars price was like a loud slap in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What did a woman like Valda Theller have for Brian to pay 100 million dollars?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was still in a trance when the gala ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Brian had already planned for the Hart family to donate money to charity, she felt like she was in a dream when he bought her worthless portrait for 100 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then portrait..." Valda Theller said hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "I'm keeping it. After all, I won it, didn't I? I'll ask them to send it to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." She nodded in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, you must be exhausted. Let me take you home," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She nodded again. She was exhausted today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting into the car, the driver drove in the front while Valda Theller and Brian sat in the back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller yawned and closed her eyes. Her head kept nodding like a chicken pecking at rice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian saw that her head almost hit the car window, so he gently cradled her head and let her lean against his shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, he would never impulsively buy a worthless portrait for 100 million dollars if it was in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did just that today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he told the media not to report anything related to Valda Theller to avoid her being judged online, someone would probably still post it online. The best he could do was suppress the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her head suddenly rubbed against his shoulder, and her arms dangling by the sides wrapped around one of his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked down at the woman whose eyes were still closed. He knew that she was still asleep.</p></div>
