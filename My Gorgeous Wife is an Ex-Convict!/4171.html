        <h1>Chapter 4169 She is Getting Married</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Well, since there is already one hot search, having a second one won't hurt. And this way, when we have the wedding, the public won't find it too sudden," Tina explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She actually wanted to buy several more hot searches, but unfortunately, the ones for the same day were already sold out, so she temporarily didn't buy any.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "..." Chandler looked at her helplessly, "What if your father sees this hot search and gets upset?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Don't worry, my mom will handle my dad. There won't be any problem," Tina said. Besides, her mom had already called her this morning, reassuring her that her dad's attitude had already softened a lot. She estimated that in another two days, he would agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Meanwhile, on the other side, Kit was in the dressing room, looking down at his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Kit, your scene is coming up soon, get ready," the assistant walked into the dressing room and reminded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Got it," Kit pursed his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> On the screen of his phone was Tina and Chandler's hot search news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just as Kit was about to get up, another actor in the same dressing room came over and, upon seeing the news Kit was looking at, said, "Oh, you're interested in this kind of news too. By the way, this Miss Stephenson seems to be your fan. You were on a hot search with her before, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Kit looks so good, it's not surprising to have a fan like a wealthy young lady. With this kind of fan, you can also get better resources. Didn't you get good resources a while ago?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm really jealous of having such fans! If I had fans like that, I would have no shortage of resources."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Others also chimed in, with undertones of sarcasm and jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit remained silent and didn't say much, just putting away his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But hey, to give resources to this kind of wealthy young lady, you'd at least have to exchange with your body, right? If there are no benefits, how could you give resources!" another voice spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit suddenly looked up and glanced at the person who had just spoken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The coldness in his eyes sent a shiver down the person's spine. "Do you think I said something wrong? You signed a contract with a famous director and got such a big pie. Who in this industry doesn't know that you sold your body to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Whether you believe it or not, if you continue speaking, maybe tomorrow you won't have a foothold in this industry!" Kit said coldly, "Have you ever thought about whether you are qualified to throw dirt on the person you want to talk about? The Stephenson family and the Hunter family, which one can you afford to provoke?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The person suddenly trembled, only now realizing their mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The Stephenson family and the Hunter family were not to be messed with. Just because of their jealousy towards Kit, they nearly let slip something that could have caused them trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit didn't say anything else and walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The others looked at the actor who had just caused trouble with a pale face, frozen like a sculpture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After leaving the dressing room, someone chased after Kit and patted his shoulder, saying, "Don't mind what that person said earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I know," Kit replied calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He didn't care about what irrelevant people said. What he cared about was... is she getting married?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Looking at the trending photos of her with Chandler, a pain that he couldn't explain filled his heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was as if it was telling him how important she was to him!</p></div>
