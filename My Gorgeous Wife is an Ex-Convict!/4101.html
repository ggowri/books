        <h1>Chapter 4099</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is just too unfortunate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After spending the night together, waking up in the morning should be either warm or flirtatious, but definitely not falling to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she fell in such an awkward position!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It made her want to find a hole to bury herself in!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?" He asked again, worried, as she had not spoken, and placed his hand on her forehead to check her temperature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not uncomfortable..." She held onto his hand, and at most, her bones were a little sore! "Just... um, where did you go just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I went to see Grandpa," Chandler said, "After you finish eating, I'll take you back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Tina was surprised, "So soon?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she had thought that she couldn't stay here for long, being sent back so quickly after spending just one night was completely unexpected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You came to find me, so I'll go back to Emerald City with you. There's no need for you to stay here any longer," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was stunned. Did he mean that... "Didn't you say you were going to stay at your family's house for a month? You're not... staying anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm, there's nothing else to do here. There's no need to stay at my family's house anymore," he said. After spending the night with her, the gu worms in his body seemed to have fallen asleep and were no longer restless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hadn't felt this comfortable and refreshed in a long time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, he probably wouldn't have to worry about his health for a while, and wouldn't need to soak in a medicinal bath anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay then, let me freshen up so we can head back early!" Tina immediately changed her attitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hunter's family always gave her a creepy feeling, and Mr. Hunter's attitude towards her was strange!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for Chandler being here, she wouldn't want to stay any longer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now that she could go back to Emerald City with Chandler, she naturally wanted to leave earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler picked up Tina and carried her into the bathroom to freshen up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Tina came out, she saw a pile of women's clothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I had the servants prepare these. Take a look and see which ones you like." Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The clothes Chandler prepared were all in line with Tina's preferences. After all, they had been together for so many years, and he knew her preferences very well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina chose a set of beige casual clothes, and Chandler took the initiative to help her get dressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina wasn't shy, since they had already seen everything there was to see between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry about last night." Chandler spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina blinked, "Why apologize? I volunteered for it last night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she also expressed concern for Chandler's health, "Is your body really okay now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, it's all good now," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She suddenly smiled sweetly. "So, I'm really your 'medicine', right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He stared at her blankly. "Yes, you really are my medicine!" She was the medicine that could calm the insects in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This medicine can help him live a complete life in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, at this moment, she was not sure what the word "medicine" meant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dressing her, he said, "Okay, let's go eat."</p></div>
