        <h1>Chapter 1890</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence knew Young master Reed was mad at Grace. Young master Reed had been working in the mansion. He did not even go to the office, but it did not stop the company's employees from feeling like they were walking on thin ice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Three senior executives had been laid off in just a few days. God knew how many more were to come if Young master Reed remained mad for a few more days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Many people had asked him about the reason for Young master Reed's sudden layoffs. How was he supposed to answer that? Even if he was audacious, he dared not say it was because the couple quarreled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately, Grace finally found him. She was the only one who could make Young master Reed so mad and the only one who could cool him down!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence hurried to the pond. Jason was standing by the pond, looking quietly at the specially cultivated lotus flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was not the season for lotus flowers to bloom, but the lotus flowers in the pond were blooming beautifully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young master Reed, Young Madam is at the entrance and refuses to leave. It seems she intends to wait at the gate," reported Terrence as he carefully observed his boss' expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There were no changes on Jason's beautiful face. It was as if he had just heard an extremely common thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let her wait if she wants to wait," Jason said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," replied Terrence. It seemed that Young master Reed was furious this time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can leave. I want to be alone," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence bowed and left while Jason continued to stay by the pond. He was motionless like a sculpture while looking at the lotus flowers in the pond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace had no idea how long she had been standing here. Her legs were very sore, and the sky had started to brighten a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is... Is it dawn already?' she thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When her phone rang, she took it out and saw that it was Uncle Kwan calling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace pressed the accept button, and Uncle Kwan asked, "Young Madam, are you at the old mansion? When Young Master Mo and Young Lady wake up..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm still at the old mansion. Tell them I left early for work when they wake up," said Grace, who then looked at the mansion in front of her. She took a deep breath and said, "Also, Uncle Kwan, make up some excuse for me if I don't go home today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you... not coming home today?" asked Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It depends on whether I can see Jay," replied Grace as she ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wanted to see Jay no matter what... No matter how long she had to stand here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace had no idea how long she had been standing. She was so sleepy, exhausted, and... hungry that she was a little shaky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As she staggered and swayed, she heard the security guard's voice. "Young Madam, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace shook her head. "I'm fine. Umm... Do you have any food here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Huh?" The security guard froze.</p></div>
