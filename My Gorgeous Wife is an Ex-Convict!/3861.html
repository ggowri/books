        <h1>Chapter 3859</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Standing at the defendant's seat, Daniel looked at Veronica with resentful eyes and shouted loudly, "Why don't you answer? Are you afraid of revealing your affair with Mason in public? You used to call each other brother and sister, but now you're lovers. You played me for a fool. Who knows what kind of illicit things you did back then? Maybe you've already slept together..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Daniel could finish his words, he was already silenced and suppressed by the bailiff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The trial was also temporarily adjourned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica said to Mason, "I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't need to apologize for this," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe after today's trial, these things will be reported by the media," Veronica said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if it's really reported, I'll find a way to suppress it," Mason said. "I don't regret what I did back then. If I didn't do it, maybe we would have missed each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After pondering for a moment, Veronica said, "I think even if you didn't do that, we wouldn't have missed each other. Daniel's feelings for me were not that deep, and my feelings for him were just a young crush. We have too many differences in our values. Even if we were together, we would probably break up after a few years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I don't want you to spend more years with him, I don't want your feelings for him to grow stronger, and I don't want him to occupy too much space in your heart," Mason said, feeling jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just a hypothesis," Veronica said. "In my heart, there's only you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was finally satisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half an hour later, the trial continued, and Daniel's emotions seemed to have calmed down, but he kept staring at Veronica and Mason with resentful eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, the verdict came and Daniel was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as the prison guards were taking Daniel away, he suddenly turned towards Veronica and Mason and said, "I curse you both. You will never be happy in your lives. One day, you will abandon each other and suffer more than I ever will! I'll be waiting in prison for your news! Hahaha...hahaha..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel laughed maniacally, and although the laughter disappeared with him, the disgust it brought lingered on Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After returning from the court to the Reed family, Veronica exchanged a few words with them before retreating to her own bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she knew that Daniel's words were just his way of venting and his so-called curse was baseless, she couldn't shake off the uncomfortable feeling in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the door opened and Mason walked in, holding a cup of milk. "You don't look too good. I heated up some milk for you. Have a sip."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica took the cup and drank a few sips of the warm milk, which eased her discomfort a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You haven't looked good since you came back. What's wrong?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"N-nothing," Veronica replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it because of Daniel?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica tensed up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it because he was sentenced to life imprisonment, or because of his so-called curse?" Mason asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He deserved the life sentence, but I know the curse was just nonsense he made up. If fate could be decided by curses, then everyone could just curse each other!" Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If that's the case, then why are you still uneasy?" Mason asked.</p></div>
