        <h1>Chapter 2734</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not easy for ordinary people to see him, and the man was now sitting by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at Brian and could not help falling into a trance. She sometimes found it unbelievable when she thought about it. She got in touch with Brian in such a way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for today." Brian's voice rang suddenly. Although his eyes were still closed as if he was taking a nap, it was obvious that he was not really asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's there to thank me for? Besides, you introduced me to many people today. Speaking of, I should thank you," said Valda Theller. Brian was undoubtedly helping her to expand her network.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian murmured, "Speaking of which, your performance today is even better than I expected. By the way, what did you and Grace talk about when Jason and I went to get food?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We just talked about you. Grace said you're a nice guy. Then I said I was lucky to be your girlfriend. Stuff like that," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A nice guy..." Brian sneered. Grace had said he was a nice man in the past, and she still said the same thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;m a nice guy... But she won't fall in love with me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think you're lucky?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller replied, "Yes. You helped me. Maybe my life would&rsquo;ve been different if I hadn't met you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He asked someone to save her on the film set. After that, she could face the people who wanted to hurt her without fear. They even became afraid to lay a hand on her because of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all because of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, Valda Theller said, "Besides, you&rsquo;re letting me experience things I can't normally experience, such as the banquet today. Wearing such a beautiful gown and attending a banquet that I usually see in films will be a good memory in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These were going to be good memories for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian murmured, "Really? What happened afterward? What else did you and Grace talk about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We talked about my job and the baby in her belly. She said it was her fourth baby. She already has triplets, and her family will be even merrier after the baby is born. How enviable." Valda Theller lamented.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Enviable?" The phoenix eyes, which had been closed, suddenly opened and stared at Valda Theller. "What&rsquo;s enviable about such a thing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Valda Theller blinked, startled by Brian's sudden anger. 'Did I say something wrong?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it worth sacrificing your health for your child? Is a child so important that she can put her own life at risk?" Brian sternly questioned Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the person in front of him right now was not Valda Theller but Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more he loved Grace, the more he worried about everything about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fear and worry only grew as he watched her belly grow larger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked blankly at the man in front of her. He was not as indifferent as a delicate doll like usual. At this moment, he was full of anger, dissatisfaction, and... fear like ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you worried about Grace?" Valda Theller murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He froze as his eyes changed slightly. Then, he shook his head vigorously. "What's wrong with me? What's the point of telling you this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, his head rested on the back of the chair once more.</p></div>
