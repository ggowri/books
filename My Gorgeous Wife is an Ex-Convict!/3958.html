        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need," Nancy replied with disgust. "You and my mother are no longer husband and wife, so there's no way we can be father and daughter."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis's face changed, while Clarissa beside him shouted, "Dad, I told you before, she doesn't care about you at all. She's just a selfish person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis felt regretful in his heart, but he still spoke kindly to Nancy, "Why do you have to be like this? I know I hurt your feelings when I divorced your mother while she was in the hospital, but with the help of the Schultz family, you can easily win over Mick's favor. It's a win-win situation, why refuse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Win-win?" Nancy looked at Francis. "So it seems that you want to use me for something related to Mick?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Francis didn't beat around the bush and said directly, "Yes, Reed Group has a project in the west of the city, and the Schultz family wants to participate. As long as you can say some good things about the Schultz family in Mick's ear and help get this done, then afterwards..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Francis could finish his sentence, Nancy directly refused, "I don't want to!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You--" Francis's old face suddenly became extremely ugly. "You better think it through. Do you think you can stay by Mick's side forever if you refuse now?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't say for sure, you'll know in the future." Nancy suddenly smiled contemptuously at the Schultz family, "For what you did to me and my mother, maybe it will come back to you someday."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Saying that, she turned around and intended to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, don't you want your mother's things?" Clarissa shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't matter. Think about it, her things should have been thrown away by you a long time ago." In fact, she didn't even need to come here. "By the way, who knows how long the Schultz family will be prosperous? Maybe soon, your things will be thrown out of here by someone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Nancy left without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy!" Clarissa shouted angrily. The person who used to cower in front of her dared to say such things to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even if she shouted louder, Nancy didn't look back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the Schultz family mansion, there was a long way to go before reaching the intersection. However, just as Nancy was about to reach the intersection, she heard the sound of a car starting behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned around and saw Clarissa driving towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy suddenly felt uneasy. As the car got closer and closer to her, Clarissa's angry and crazy face was reflected in the windshield...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick received a call from Nancy's phone, but it wasn't Nancy on the other end. It was a strange man's voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, are you a friend of Miss Nancy? Due to a car accident, Nancy is now in the hospital in a coma. As you are the most recent contact in her phone, if you are her friend, please come to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Car accident? Hospital?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When these words came through the phone, Mick even felt a blank in his mind.</span></p></div>
