        <h1>Chapter 1293</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared at Grace's fingers. "Are you sure it only hurts a little?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How much pain do you think I&rsquo;m in?" Grace gave a faint smile. "You know how my knuckles tend to ache when it's cold and humid. I'll go look for Dr. Russell tomorrow to have him take a look at my hands."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, Dr. Russell had asked her to go for treatment once a week, but so much had happened since then. She had also gotten pregnant, so she stopped going.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wondered if Dr. Russell would get mad when she went to him this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll go with you tomorrow," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. You've got work to do. I can go myself," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go with you." He insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing that, Grace stopped refusing. She was about to continue eating when he suddenly said, "I'll feed you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Feed me?" She was slightly stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't your hands hurting? It's inconvenient for you to hold the chopsticks. Let me feed you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was true that she was in slight pain, but it was not so bad that she could not hold her chopsticks and pick up her food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, watching Jason pull the chopsticks out of her hand, Grace could not help but smile and accept his gesture to feed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, a man was attentively feeding a woman and even peeling shrimp for her in the dining room. The gentleness on his face was something he had never shown others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was only gentle to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The maids were also stunned at the sight of this. After all, they had never seen Master Reed feed anyone before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Master Reed was now waiting on Young Madam as she ate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was really... waiting on her. It was as if Young Madam meant everything to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Jason was not saying anything, anyone could see how much he loved the woman in front of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Jason took Grace to Dr. Russell's small clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Dr. Russell saw Grace and Jason, he raised his eyebrows and secretly sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing how they were walking in together, Dr. Russell knew that the Hart boy had lost!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You haven't been here for so long, I thought you had given up on your hands!" Dr. Russell snapped as he glared at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he knew it was Emerald City's Jason standing next to Grace, he kept his usual attitude. He had no intention of changing his attitude just because of Jason&rsquo;s identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So much has happened during this time, so... I'm sorry I haven&rsquo;t been coming," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell said, "It's not me you've let down, it's your hands!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew Dr. Russell had the best intentions despite his harsh words. "Dr. Russell, if I stop the treatment for my hands now, will it matter if I wait a year to treat it?"</p></div>
