        <h1>Chapter 4212</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit groaned but showed </span><span>no intention of resisting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he accepted that he deserved this, that he owed Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, Kit's face was covered in blood!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nurses outside heard the commotion and rushed in. After seeing this scene, they exclaimed in shock and quickly called for someone to stop Chandler. After all, if the fight continued, someone might end up dead!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Kit said, "It's okay, let him hit me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The medical staff looked at each other in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the victim said so, they couldn't just let Chandler continue beating Kit. If there was a fatality in the hospital, the responsibility would still fall on the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor and nurses quickly lifted Kit back onto the bed and examined his injuries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler tightly pursed his lips and walked to the side of the bed, looking down at Kit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The nervous nurse looked at Chandler, afraid that he would strike again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, this time, Chandler didn't raise his hand again. He just spoke in a cold voice, "In the future, don't appear in front of Tina and me again. Otherwise, I don't know if you'll be able to keep your life!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Chandler turned and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can Kit never appear in front of Tina again from now on, she wondered as she slowly closed her eyes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would it be better if he had died in the car accident, at least he would have been happy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least until death, Tina would have been by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least he could still die trying to save Tina!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, for him, it felt like falling into an endless abyss.</span></p></div>
