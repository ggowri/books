        <h1>Chapter 860</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one immediately fell lovingly into Grace's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, would you like to go to the amusement park this Sunday?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one's eyes immediately lit up while his little head nodded vigorously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I take you to the amusement park this weekend?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Won't it be too much trouble for you?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not at all. I look forward to spending a day with Nelson at the amusement park!" said Grace. Besides, once Kyla and her family moved to G City, it would not be as convenient to see the little one then as it was now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, you'll have to go to the hospital for a follow-up this weekend. Aunty will take you for the follow-up, and I'll take Nelson to the amusement park. It's just nice," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... thank you," Kyla said shyly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No trouble at all. Isn't it, Nelson?" asked Grace as she turned her face to the little one in her arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she got in return was a sweet kiss from the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at her son who was in Grace's arms with a smile on her lips. Nelson was her life. She would protect her son from anyone and would not let anyone take him away from her no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin, Martin?" A soft female voice rang in Martin Weiss's ears, pulling him back from his trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Paisley Daniels who was beside him and said lightly, "What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just wanted to ask you what you think of this dress?" Paisley Daniels was wearing a pure white evening gown. As if afraid that Martin Weiss could not see it clearly, she spun around in circles in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The skirt of her white gown swayed as she spun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at the spinning figure. His eyes were falling into a trance. Another woman in a white dress had also spun in circles in front of him before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman had looked at him with a bright smile and said, "I, Kyla, love you, Martin Weiss, the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin, tell me, what will you name our children?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin, I'm so happy that you love me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought he had forgotten these words, but somehow, what Kyla once said became clearer and clearer in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do I look good?" Paisley Daniels's voice rang again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Paisley Daniels's beautiful face. 'This woman is the one I've chosen. Why am I thinking about Kyla?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You look good," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile on Paisley Daniels's face widened. She walked to Martin Weiss's side and held his arm affectionately before saying, "Then this is what I'll be wearing for the dinner party at my house in two weeks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure. Then pick out a set of jewelry that goes with the gown. I'll pay for it," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I pick out an expensive one?" she asked tentatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter. I'll give you whatever you want," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What I want is your love!' Paisley Daniels said to herself. She had been by his side all these years, and though he was very attentive toward her, she felt that he had never gotten over that woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had seen him with Kyla before. He was so doting and sweet with her. However, when he was with her, she did not seem to feel it.</p></div>
