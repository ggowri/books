        <h1>Chapter 3951</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, the people in the dormitory were divided into two factions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One faction believed that Mick's gaming skills were high, so it was normal for him to defeat the champion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other faction believed that the champion might have deliberately lost or was nervous because the opponent was the heir of a big boss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Nancy leaned towards the second possibility. After all, in her opinion, a rich young man and a gaming champion might have some intention of letting the other win.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, these days, when she played games with Mick, she realized how good he was at gaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, looking at his photo in the internal magazine, with his bangs covering his forehead and wearing headphones, although it was a photo from two years ago, he looked completely different from his mature and elegant appearance now. In the photo, he looked calm but with a youthful feeling, with a hint of youthfulness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is that what Mick looked like two years ago?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I wonder what he looked like even earlier? Nancy guessed in her heart, and it seemed that her curiosity about him was increasing little by little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the door of the CEO's office not far away opened, and the executives and secretaries came out one after another. It seemed that things had been settled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Nancy walked into the CEO's office, Mick glanced at her and asked, "Were you killing time outside by reading magazines just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" She just realized that she was still holding the magazine. "Um."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a boring content."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's interesting. I even saw the content of your gaming match with the champion," Nancy said. "Unfortunately, I wasn't there at the time. Maybe there is a video of the match online. I want to watch it. It must be exciting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was just for fun, not a real competition," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the feeling on site is always different. I wish I had bought a ticket to see it live back then." Unfortunately, there's no chance for that now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to experience the atmosphere of a live battle like that, I can take you this weekend. Of course, if you want to play a friendly match after the game and experience it yourself, I can arrange that too," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was stunned, staring at the man in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he suggesting that she play a friendly match with the post-game champion? For ordinary people, this is something that is almost impossible to achieve, but when he said it so casually, it seemed like it was nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to go?" Mick's voice rang out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay...okay," Nancy said. "But...there's no need for the friendly match."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever you want," Mick smiled and said nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, in the rented room, Nancy looked at the black and white photo of her mother hanging on the wall. "Mom, I will avenge you and not let Clarissa get away with it. So...please bless me from heaven and let me succeed!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the weekend, Nancy and Mick arrived at the gaming competition venue held by the Reed Group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because Nancy didn't want to attract too much attention, she deliberately only got regular seats. She was afraid that if she sat in the VIP area, she would end up in the gossip news the next day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even so, Nancy found that Mick himself was a source of light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he was just wearing ordinary clothes and sitting in his seat, he gave off a feeling that </span><span>was different from ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While watching the game, Nancy noticed that there were many female spectators around her, and their eyes would occasionally glance at Mick.</span></p></div>
