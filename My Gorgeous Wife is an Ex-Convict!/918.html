        <h1>Chapter 917</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had heard Grace talk about how she and Jason met, so she somewhat knew about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she was lamenting how fate miraculously put two irrelevant people together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now she wondered whether such fate was actually doom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You needn't suffer for my sake!" Kyla said, full of guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not all about you. Kyla, you don't have to feel guilty. Jason has already made up his mind to make me his sister again anyway. Even if it wasn't because of you, something else would&rsquo;ve come up," said Grace. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as Jason decided on something, he would do it somehow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she could refuse him once or twice, how many times could she get away with it? Maybe her refusal was just a part of his game, making it more challenging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However..." Kyla seemed to want to say more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, at least you and Nelson can now stay in Emerald City without any worries. I'm a former convict who has gotten my name cleared. While I'm only a small paralegal, now I have Jason as my backup. It's a pretty good deal,&rdquo; Grace said nonchalantly, but Kyla knew Grace was just saying it to make her feel better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it really a good deal? He's a man she wanted to forget, and now she's tied down.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let's not talk about me. How about you? Did Martin Weiss give you a hard time yesterday?" Grace said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla gave a wry smile. "He wants Nelson to acknowledge his biological family and return to the Weiss family, but I refused."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does Nelson know that Martin Weiss is his father?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No. Nelson just happened to fall asleep when we arrived at the hotel. Before Martin Weiss could say anything, Jason's secretary arrived," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it had not been for Jason's influence, Martin Weiss would never have let them go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she left the hotel suite with her son still asleep in her arms, Martin Weiss's face was frighteningly sullen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pondered for a moment before saying, "Since Martin Weiss said so, then maybe he&rsquo;ll fight you for custody of the child." This was also the most effective way Martin Weiss could get Nelson to recognize his biological family and return to the Weiss family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word &lsquo;custody&rsquo; seemed to trigger Kyla. Her face immediately turned pale as she said through gritted teeth, "How could he? How dare he?! He doesn't want Nelson at all. What's more, he has always been a perfectionist. He doesn't care about a child with flaws like Nelson. He just wants revenge!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I know nothing about Kyla and Martin Weiss's dispute, but Martin Weiss's feelings for Nelson... ' Grace did not think he seemed dismissive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'After all, before Martin Weiss knew about Nelson's identity, he had helped Nelson find his hearing aid and held his hand to find the adults he came with. At the same time, Martin Weiss also offered to sponsor Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or is it the nature of their blood? Even if he's a perfectionist, he can't help wanting to be close to his disabled child even if he hadn&rsquo;t known about the boy&rsquo;s true identity then.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s just an assumption. Whether you'll fight for custody depends on what Martin Weiss thinks," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He'll fight for it!" Kyla said with a dry throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Knowing Martin Weiss, since the man said that he wanted Nelson to return to the Weiss family and make sure she could no longer see him, there was no way he would not fight for Nelson&rsquo;s custody.</p></div>
