        <h1>Chapter 80</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she said his name Jason's whole body stiffened.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you hate Jason Reed?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She sighed and said, "Everyone in this City knows him. When I had the car accident, Jennifer Atkinson was Jason's fianc&eacute;e. So, of course, I was not going to get out of it easily. How many people want to curry favor with him? How many people think that by hurting me it&rsquo;ll gain them favor with him?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace&rsquo;s eyes took on a faraway look. &ldquo;Who knows&hellip; maybe if that accident had involved someone else. Someone other than Jennifer Atkinson, I could have won the lawsuit. Would I have been spared from being in jail for three years and experienced all those things? Maybe.&rdquo; Her eyes were so earnest when they met his. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t drink and drive, Jay. I wouldn&rsquo;t do that. I still can&rsquo;t understand how the evidence could corroborate that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason knew the ins and outs of the case intimately.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was not angry or sad, but the faint self-degradation she showed made him feel very guilty.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Perhaps half of her pain was because of him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He squatted in front of her, staring at her bent hands. "If I had known that you would suffer so much, I would have protected you three years ago."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This sentence had nothing to do with the game but was something that had come from the bottom of his heart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He hated thinking that this woman had suffered because of him. He was cold, yes, but he also considered himself fair. He wasn&rsquo;t cruel. And Grace had been tortured for no other reason than that he might bestow some favors on her tormentors.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The thought sickened him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Back then, he hadn&rsquo;t cared one way or the other. But now that he knew her. That he believed her when she said it was all an accident&hellip; it opened something in his chest that made him ache with regret.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&rdquo;I know that you would have defended me,&rdquo; Grace said. She patted his hand. &ldquo;Alright, let's not talk about this." Grace smiled again and lifted her hand to rub his dark hair.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It seemed that she had been doing this more and more frequently recently.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina entered the hallway and paused beside them, she shifted her feet awkwardly. &ldquo;I, uh, got the medicine,&rdquo; she said to the two of them. &ldquo;And Dr. Craigge included two other prescriptions which we can fill once we get you home.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Thank you, Lina,&rdquo; Grace said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go get the car from the underground parking lot. Jay, help Grace to the entrance and wait for me."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright," Jason agreed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He slid his arms beneath her legs.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;J-Jay, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;It should be obvious, no?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;They have wheelchairs, you don&rsquo;t need to carry me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;The walking boot they give you won&rsquo;t suffice. You should probably have crutches.&rdquo; He hefted her into his arms and moved like he intended to carry her back into the hospital room to argue for said crutches from the doctor.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Grace said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. I just need some rest.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Jason agreed. &ldquo;That means rest from walking,&rdquo; he said simply, as if it explained everything.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too heavy for you to carry me like this!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd. You hardly weigh anything.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It&rsquo;s true. He noticed that the other night too, when he lifted her from the table and moved her to the bed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She tensed in his arms. &ldquo;Relax, Grace,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t drop you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then she rested her head against his chest.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason felt his heart beat pick up. Her scent. Her nearness. Knowing she was all right when he&rsquo;d been left thinking the worst&hellip; it all sent the blood in his body rushing to his head.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason's eyes were filled with a tenderness that he didn't even know was there.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace lifted one hand around his neck and clung to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He lifted her higher. Held her closer.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His lips brushed the top of her head.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Thank you for coming for me, Jay.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He made some noncommittal sound and then walked out of the emergency room and headed for the hospital entrance.</p></div>
