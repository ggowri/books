        <h1>Chapter 1268</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His soft voice sounded almost gentle and casual, but his eyes were staring at her, not letting any subtle expression on her face slip from his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lower lip. "There's nothing to regret. Since I&rsquo;ve made my decision, I won't regret it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Besides, even though I&rsquo;ve told him, I still can't give Brian what he wants. After all, the man I love was...' Grace's eyes darkened at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She loved him so much back then. What about now? Did she still have affections for him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's on your mind?" he asked as his fingers grabbed her jaw suddenly. He did not like the sad and lonely look in her eyes. It was as if there was something he could not grasp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to hear the truth," he said, narrowing his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hesitated for a moment before finally saying, "I'm just wondering what kind of feelings I have for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark peach blossom eyes narrowed. He stared at her, and those thin lips of his parted lightly. His voice spoke with a hint of hoarseness, "Then tell me, what kind of feelings do you have for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know." Grace raised the corners of her lips with self-mockery. "After all, I used to love you. However, too many things happened afterward and it seems that those feelings have been torn apart. I don't know what kind of feelings we'll have for each other. But I'll do my best to be a good wife and mother no matter what."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, she spoke with a certain longing in her eyes, "If it's possible, I hope... we can be like a family. After all, we have three children now, and I don't want it to look like we're not on good terms in front of them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She still wanted to give her children a warm home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pondered. 'Family... But what I want is more than just family. I want more...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you only want to be my family?" he suddenly asked ironically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace replied, " Yeah. Can I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her. "So you don't love me anymore, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned, not knowing how to answer all of a sudden. 'Do I not love him anymore? Not... really. After all, I loved him so deeply. Even... when he wanted me to love him again after we broke up, I was touched and thought of starting all over again.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after everything that had happened, she did not think that she and he could &lsquo;start over&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whether you do or not, we can find out by giving it a try," he said and kissed her on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow, there was a surge of anger in his heart that quickly spread. Why was he so upset when she said she only wanted to be his family? Her silence now made him even angrier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he angry because she was not denying it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was even angry at himself for caring so much about her silence. Why was he so reluctant? What was he expecting?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um..." Caught off guard, Grace's eyes widened as she stared at the face close to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's kissing me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The touch on her lips felt so real, but she felt like she was in a trance.</p></div>
