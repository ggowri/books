        <h1>Chapter 3885</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because he had no concept of money, or because she was too inexperienced?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this enough money?" He added at the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it's enough!" Veronica quickly replied, "This money is more than enough. Should I tell Uncle Reed and Auntie Grace that this money is too much if they give it to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just take it. If you return the money to them now, they might think there's a problem between us," Mason said. "If you don't know how to spend the money right now, just save it for later. You can think about it when you're pregnant and resting at home after the wedding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Veronica was speechless again. She probably couldn't spend this 20 billion in her lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After ending the call with Mason, Veronica looked at her curious and gossipy friends around her and cleared her throat. "Um, this money is probably... my dowry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dowry?" Shirley widened her eyes and stuttered, "As expected of a wealthy family, you can probably make it onto the female rich list of Emerald City now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica thought about it and realized that she now had a net worth of 20 billion?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, you will definitely be very happy in the future!" Shirley sincerely wished her friend well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the Reed family is the wealthiest in Emerald City, their willingness to give 2 billion to their future daughter-in-law proves their value of Veronica. Shirley is genuinely happy for her friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Shirley. I'm sure you'll be happy too in the future," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll hold you to that!" Shirley replied, and the two girls burst into laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wedding photos are an important step before getting married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Veronica's belly is not yet visible, they quickly completed this step. However, to prevent her from getting too tired, the wedding photos were almost all arranged indoors. They only took one set of outdoor photos, and in the team, there were also obstetricians, nurses, and a nanny assistant to take care of Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Overall, Veronica felt like a VIP panda with the treatment she received during the photo shoot. She didn't even have to lift a finger to drink water, as someone would bring the cup directly to her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several people worked on her makeup and hairstyle at the same time, which greatly saved her time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After everything was done, Veronica looked at herself in the mirror wearing a white wedding dress, with exquisite makeup, and almost couldn't recognize herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It must be said that top makeup artists and stylists are different. Although the person in the mirror is still her, it doesn't give an exaggerated feeling, but it's different from usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like enlarging the beautiful parts of her facial features, making her more prominent and stunning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you ready?" a voice sounded behind her. Veronica turned around and saw Mason walking towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was wearing a black suit, a white shirt, and a white bow tie, looking like a prince in a fairy tale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No, to her, he was always her prince!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's go," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason reached out his hand to Veronica. "Let's head over to the studio."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She placed her hand in his, and they walked towards the studio.</p></div>
