        <h1>Chapter 17-2</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, none of her classmates spoke for her, let alone stood up for her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with her skin?&rdquo; Maria asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Probably from the accident,&rdquo; Mia replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">No. Her pale flesh was because she hadn't been exposed to any sunlight during her three years of imprisonment, making her fairer than anyone. And the scars&hellip; they weren&rsquo;t from the car accident, but from the beatings and abuses she endured while imprisoned.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Some of the scars had not faded away, and they were hideous.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace struggled to stand up, and though she pushed to her knees, her hand remained anchored to the ground. What the&mdash;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Maria was stepping on her right hand with her high heels.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Grace,&rdquo; she said dramatically. &ldquo;Why are you in such a hurry to leave? You have not yet apologized to Gregory," Maria said. She looked as if she couldn't wait to see Grace in a more pathetic state as she twisted her heel and stepped down harder.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The pain in Grace's hand reminded her of her prison days when her finger bones had been broken inch by agonizing inch.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Back then, Grace had been unable to defend herself and was forced to accept the treatment.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Grace wasn&rsquo;t constrained now, and she wasn&rsquo;t going down without a fight. She used all of her might to push Maria's foot away from her right hand. Then she lunged to her feet and ran for the door.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wanted to get out of this place. She had to get out!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She held her torn clothes around herself and ran forward. However, a strong force came from behind her, catching her by her hair and yanking her backward. She screamed, feeling hair ripped from her scalp and then she gasped as her body connected with the floor.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Stop! Leave me alone!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the doors to the room remained closed and no one came to help her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Greg twisted the hand he held in her hair. "Are you trying to run away? Don't you know that my family is one of the shareholders of this club... eh?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Greg paused as he made that statement.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A moment later, Grace heard a familiar voice saying, "Greg, what are you trying to do?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace froze instantly. That&rsquo;s... Sean's voice.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace shivered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had never expected to meet Sean again&mdash;let alone in such a sorry state after getting out of prison.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why? Have you brought your fianc&eacute;e here for a meal? What a coincidence. Your ex-girlfriend is here to have a meal with me too. However, your ex-girlfriend doesn't know what's good for her and she has agitated me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; Sean replied neutrally.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Greg rubbed at the scar near his brow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking I owe her from our last time meeting.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Greg spoke, he pulled Grace's hair, forcing her to lift her head to face Sean.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing him, after all, that had transpired, it was like a chasm of grief was boiling up to swallow her completely.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And there, besides Sean&hellip; Lily Atkinson.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The woman who'd egged him on to break her bones. Who&rsquo;d stood beside him and goaded him to show no mercy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing them, being at the mercy of Greg, was like a nightmare roaring to life.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; she demanded.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Greg looked at Sean as if asking his permission.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean shrugged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here for dinner,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How you choose to&hellip;entertain&hellip;yourself is up to you, Greg. I have nothing to do with her.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was cut to the heart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although she had given up on Sean and had resented him for his harsh treatment, part of her had believed that he&rsquo;d been angry by the position her accident had put him in. She expected this of Lily, and could even think that Lily was blinded by her grief.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Sean?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She&rsquo;d never given him reason to punish her like this.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had expected his indifference, but she saw now that he truly wanted her to suffer.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Endlessly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And for what? To impress his new fiancee?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You might want to take this outside,&rdquo; Sean suggested. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;all have a good night.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He held out his arm and Lilly accepted it. They paraded off like they hadn&rsquo;t a care in the world.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Like he hadn&rsquo;t all but encouraged this man to rape her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Greg started pulling her toward an artificial pond near the doors.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll press charges!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;There are witnesses.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Greg laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an ex-con. And I own this club. Who do you think they&rsquo;ll believe?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace tried to stay calm but her heart was beating a hundred miles a minute. She dug in her heels knowing if he got her outside, he&rsquo;d overpower her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This couldn't be happening!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She dug in her heels and cried out as her hair ripped again because she refused to stumble behind him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;B*tch!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Greg eyed the pond and the next minute he took her and shoved her face beneath the water.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace thrashed and choked and tried to hold her breath while fighting against his grip.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she started to lose consciousness, her head was dragged back up. She sucked in a giant gulp of air and then choked as the water in her lungs came rushing back up.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before she could catch her breath, she was shoved back down again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was punishing her, she realized.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Greg had lost face when Sean beat the sh*t out of him all those years ago.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Greg had never gotten over it, and while he couldn&rsquo;t take on Sean because of his family, Grace was an easy target.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Cold water gushed into Grace's mouth and nose, suffocating her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, let's see who will save you now."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the next reprieve, she dragged air into her lungs and blinked rapidly. Oh my god, Sean was still at the edge of the room. Near the grand staircase. And Lily was beside him. &ldquo;My love,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Jay is waiting for us. Don't let him wait too long."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily's voice resounded in Grace's ears.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"All right," Sean said, before turning his back on Grace with complete finality.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace felt suffocated and she no longer had the strength to retaliate.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Once, twice, the cold water covered her head, and no matter how she fought or rallied, there was no escape.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Would she die like this?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Had she survived prison only to end up the victim of some spoiled heir&rsquo;s revenge?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">No one would save Grace. Even if she managed to survive, she would be half-dead.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Enough! Bring that woman to me!" A voice suddenly resounded from the second floor.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace blinked rapidly, but her vision was too blurry to see.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she knew that voice. Knew it intimately.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Brother?&rdquo;</p></div>
