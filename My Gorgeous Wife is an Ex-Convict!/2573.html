        <h1>Chapter 2571</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he got home, he heard from the servant that his son was still practicing in the piano room, so he went to the piano room and gently pushed the door open. He only saw the little one playing attentively in front of the piano. There were many little paper frogs that Jasper had given to his son on the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His son, who normally disdained expensive toys, treated these little frogs as though they were treasures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In his son's opinion, his own father was not nearly as important as that girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the father, he had never fallen in love with anyone, but his son was different. Although the little one had not fully grasped the idea of &lsquo;love&rsquo;, he only knew that Jasper was important to him. However... maybe the feeling would turn into love when he was older.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it would turn into... a paranoid controlling behavior instead?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had no idea how deep his son's feelings for Jasper would be in the future, but one thing was certain&mdash;he did not want his son to be like George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the end of the piano tune, William noticed Philip Barlow standing in the doorway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Daddy," he called out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow walked into the piano room and looked at the little frogs sitting on the piano. He picked up one of the little frogs and said, "Do you like them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." William nodded without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it because Jasper gave them to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." The little one nodded again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you like Jasper enough to want to be with her all the time?" Philip Barlow asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little head nodded a third time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But what if you find out one day that you're not the person Jasper likes the most? What if she likes someone else and he&rsquo;s the one she wants to be with?" Philip Barlow asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he could not help laughing after asking the question. 'What's the matter with me? Is it because I was influenced by George Gregory today? Is that why I'm asking a six-year-old such a question?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I&rsquo;ll make myself so brilliant that she&rsquo;ll only want to be with me," the little one answered earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow's lips moved, and he suppressed the slight sigh in his mouth. Sometimes, those who were better than others would not necessarily be the recipients of love. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, there would not be so many people who failed to get whatever they wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, then you&rsquo;ll become a brilliant person," said Philip Barlow as he touched the back of his son's head. He would try his best to give him good resources.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, Philip Barlow's phone rang. It was a call from the driver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Barlow, I wanted to send Mr. Gregory to the Gregory family&rsquo;s house, but Mr. Gregory insisted that I take him to another place when we were on our way or he would jump out of the car. I... I could only send him to where he wanted to go," the driver said and gave the address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip Barlow knew that the address was where Grace had rented a place for Amber Mitchell. Grace had asked him to take care of Amber Mitchell when she left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed George Gregory had gone to see Amber Mitchell again after getting drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Barlow, Mr. Gregory has taken the elevator upstairs. I... I'm still downstairs. Well... shall I wait for Mr. Gregory?" the driver asked.</p></div>
