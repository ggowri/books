        <h1>Chapter 3751</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, we called you here today to ask about this. What's going on?" The homeroom teacher handed her the printed copies of the photos posted on the school forum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Many students in the school are saying that you did something bad outside of school. Can you explain your relationship with the man who picked you up from school?" the homeroom teacher asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my friend's driver. My friend asked him to come pick me up," Veronica answered truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your friend's driver? What kind of person is your friend?" the teacher asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Teacher, my friendships are my private matter," Veronica said, not wanting to reveal Mason's situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But now, your private matter has affected the school, so I hope you can explain clearly. Otherwise, the school will have to handle it according to the school rules," the teacher said displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a friend I grew up with. His family is quite wealthy, so he has this car and a driver," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh? Is your friend a boy or a girl? How old is he? Why did he send a car to pick you up?" The teacher fired one question after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica had to say, "He's a boy, 18 years old. As for why he sent a car to pick me up, it's because I'm going to meet him, and he thinks it's better to control the time by sending a car to pick me up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Mason is a person who values time very much.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you ask your friend to come to the school and explain it?" the teacher said. "After all, these rumors are not good for the school's reputation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Teachers, I don't think I've done anything immoral. I've explained the photos clearly. It's strange that people assume I've done something immoral just because an expensive car came to pick me up. Those people need to provide evidence to prove that I've really done something immoral, instead of asking me to prove that I haven't!" Veronica spoke frankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The teacher frowned. "Veronica, how can you speak like that?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just stating the facts! Even if you want someone to confess, you need a complete chain of evidence, not just a few photos to determine everything," Veronica said. "Moreover, I will collect evidence to sue those who spread these rumors!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." The teacher's face looked unpleasant. "The school just hopes that you can bring your friend to the school and explain it clearly. If you refuse, then the school will handle it according to the school rules. For students who damage the school's reputation, the most serious punishment is expulsion!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Expulsion?! Veronica was stunned. She didn't expect it to be true, just like what Vanessa said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that when she was called to meet with the school leaders today, Vanessa also intervened?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even the posts on the school forum could have been made by Vanessa! After all, the post was anonymously sent to the school forum on the same night that she and Vanessa had a conflict in the cafeteria.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If the school really wants to punish me, I will use legal means to defend my rights!" Veronica said without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you saying that if the school punishes you, you will sue the school?" the homeroom teacher asked angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shouldn't I defend my own reputation?" Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the department head's phone suddenly rang. Immediately, the department head's face changed and he hurriedly said, "That's enough, Veronica, you can leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Leave?" The homeroom teacher looked at the department head in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, she can leave. This matter doesn't need to be discussed anymore. Like Veronica said, she didn't do anything that violated morals or school rules," the department head said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The homeroom teacher wanted to say something else, but under the department head's cold gaze, he immediately shut his mouth.</span></p></div>
