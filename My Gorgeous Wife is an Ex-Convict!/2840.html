        <h1>Chapter 2838</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled faintly, and a touch of pain flickered in his eyes. &lsquo;Yeah, even though you have power and everything else, there are always things out of your control as long as you&rsquo;re human.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He agreed with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side, Valda Theller and Kyla reached the lounge. Valda Theller asked, "Kyla, I'd like to know how Grace is doing. Is she okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She&rsquo;s doing alright. She has to stay home and stay in bed all day. She and her baby are stable. If everything goes well, she should be able to deliver the baby at 37 weeks," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good." Valda Theller was relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla sized up Valda Theller's outfit today. She looked classy and luxurious. The things she was wearing were obviously prepared by Brian. Besides, he had put in the effort as the gown and jewelry were not ordinary haute couture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "Speaking of which, you look so pretty today. I almost didn't recognize you. You and Mr. Hart must be on good terms."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "We're alright. Brian is a nice person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was why she wanted to treat him better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, he's a nice guy and serious about relationships. Grace also said..." Kyla suddenly paused, noticing she had a slip of the tongue. She instantly looked a little embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller casually said, "What did Grace say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Kyla looked at her with some hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller seemed to figure out her confusion. "Kyla, I know Brian once loved Grace." He still did, but she could not say that in front of Kyla. "Everyone has a past, but I can't get involved in his past. He used to love someone so seriously, and it makes me think he's very different from the stereotype of a wealthy heir."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, she said, "Maybe I was initially attracted to him because he&rsquo;s serious about relationships."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Doesn't it bother you?" Kyla asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller confessed, "It does. It bothers me because I love him, but that's how he is. It's part of him. Since I love him, I should accept him for who he is!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled. "Valda, you're just like Grace said. You're nice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "Thank you. By the way, Kyla, I'm relieved to see how close you and your husband are today. I was worried when I saw the press conference you held earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Close?' Kyla's heart was full of bitterness, but she smiled. "Yeah, we're doing okay." However, everything was fake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the lights dimmed suddenly, and the lights of the stage at the front lit up. The emcee on the stage said, "This is a special part of our evening today. We'll randomly pick several attendees using the spotlight. We hope you can donate some small items to participate in the auction and contribute to charity."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the emcee finished speaking, bursts of applause immediately rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the beam of light began to glide over the attendees and finally stopped on one woman. She smiled and donated her earrings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, another beam of light stopped on a man, who also smiled and graciously took off the watch from his wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several people donated their small belongings. Of course, those items cost a fortune even though they were small.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the spotlight landed on Valda Theller, and the audience's eyes instantly fell on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The emcee on the stage said, "Oh, I wonder what this beautiful lady is going to donate."</p></div>
