        <h1>Chapter 3604</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ran all the way, stepping on each step, panting as she walked up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, a familiar figure caught her eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was&mdash;William!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper hurriedly ran up, intending to call out to him, but stopped abruptly when she saw his expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, from her perspective, she saw him from the side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stood there quietly, with his head half lowered, his gaze fixed on the tombstone, his face filled with an indescribable sadness and mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never seen such an expression on his face before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, she didn't know how to change her words, or what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just stared at him blankly, not knowing how much time had passed. It seemed like he could feel her gaze, as he slowly turned around and looked towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their gazes met.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you come here?" There was a gentle smile on his face, as if they were meeting under normal circumstances.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, she would have felt comforted by his smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, she felt a twinge of sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... came to find you," she said, her nose tingling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have never wanted to come here, never wanted to see this woman," William murmured. "I hate the mistakes she has made, I hate that her blood flows through me, I hate her even in death for never repenting. In the years we were together, she never loved me, I was probably just a tool she could use in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper listened and walked to William's side, reaching out and holding his hand!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if this could give him strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he looked like a person exhausted to the extreme, as if he could collapse at any moment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But even so, I think I should be grateful to her. Regardless of her reasons, at least she gave birth to me, gave me life," William continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, you are you, and your mother is your mother. Regardless, the matters of the previous generation have already passed and have nothing to do with us!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really unrelated?" he asked, looking at her with a bitter smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, it's unrelated!" she replied firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've also seen the post on the school forum, right?" he suddenly said. "I am the son of a criminal, so there is a high possibility that I will also commit crimes! Even my current friendship with you, getting close to you, it's all for a purpose, to avenge my mother!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have seen that post, so I know better than anyone how nonsensical it is! Who says that the child of a criminal will definitely commit crimes? And who says that our friendship is solely for avenging your mother? If anyone dares to say that in front of me, I will definitely give them a piece of my mind!" Jasper angrily said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her intently, as her face turned red with anger. "Do you really think I won't?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't, because you are William, the William I have known since childhood. I trust you, just as I trust myself!" she said. "So, no matter who maliciously slanders you, I won't believe it! I won't, and neither will my family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper..." he called out her name in a hoarse voice, suddenly reaching out and pulling her into his embrace, with his head resting on her shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if, at this moment, only she could support his exhausted body.</span></p></div>
