        <h1>Chapter 3105</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to her lame leg, she walked slowly. However, the assistant holding the loudspeaker seemed impatient and went straight to Valda, saying, "Are you pretending to be lame on purpose? You're wasting time. If you keep this up, I won't be polite!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I am walking, just...a bit slower," Valda said through gritted teeth. In fact, she had already experienced these insults and sarcasm before, so they didn't mean anything to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She has faced even more embarrassing situations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda wanted to quicken her pace, but it was clear that in the eyes of the other person, it was intentional!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The assistant impatiently grabbed Valda's arm and dragged her aside, saying, "Don't think that by dragging your feet and walking slowly, you'll have a chance to get close to the actors. Let me tell you, I've seen plenty of people like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was being dragged, causing her steps to become unsteady. Suddenly, she lost her balance and fell to one side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The assistant quickly let go, and Valda's body fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ouch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda frowned as she had twisted her ankle when she fell earlier. Now she was experiencing a sharp pain that felt like it was drilling into her bones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was half lying on the ground, tightly biting her lower lip, suppressing the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the assistant thought that Valda did it on purpose, and her disgust on her face intensified, especially when the director nearby was impatiently urging, "Why isn't it ready yet? Hurry up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, yes, right away!" The assistant quickly responded, then turned to Valda and said, "Hurry up, get up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Valda can't get up at all right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So the assistant spoke in a harsh tone, "You're not getting up, huh? Fine, I'll drag you up!" He then forcefully grabbed Valda's arm and pulled her as if she were a piece of cargo, trying to get her to stand up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pain..." Valda finally couldn't bear the pain and let out a low cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the other person dragged on even more vigorously, "You're just pretending not to leave, right? Fine, I'll let you go! Let's see how long you can keep pretending!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was in so much pain that she broke out in a cold sweat and her mind became somewhat confused, as if she had returned to the time when she had just awakened from a vegetative state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, she spent every day in pain. Each day was a torment for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, she even feels that maybe it would be better to just die to feel some relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever she feels hopeless, she always murmurs one name in her heart - Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was her persistent and lingering concern that she couldn't shake off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She's afraid that if she really dies like this, the man will blame himself and feel guilty. If she's alive, then the man will feel much better, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she also wants to see him one more time, even if they can't be together, but being able to look at him a little longer would be nice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian... Brian...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I really want to see him, so much... so much...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a sound rang out above her head, followed by what seemed like the sound of a heavy object falling to the ground and the assistant's scream, and then the noise and commotion around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the force that had been pulling her all along was now gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did something happen?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, she faintly heard the familiar and elegant voice calling out to her, "Valda! Valda! How are you, Valda!" in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is... Brian's voice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked up with a dazed expression and saw the familiar face in front of her. She immediately recognized the worried, anxious, angry, and self-blaming expressions on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I have seen this kind of self-blame before. It was when Grace's daughter Jasmine was kidnapped, and this self-blame has been on his face ever since. He knows that she was very worried at that time.</p></div>
