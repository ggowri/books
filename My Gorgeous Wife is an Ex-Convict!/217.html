        <h1>Chapter 216</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching the video of Grace kneeling, Lily unknowingly smirked. "Some people just want to die and others can't stop them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Isn't it? This extra seems to have offended Evelyn, which explains why she&rsquo;s always getting picked on by Evelyn. Everyone in the film crew knows that Evelyn can't be offended..." As the assistant spoke, she found herself saying something she should not have.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Immediately, the assistant paled and said to Lily, "I'm sorry I said the wrong thing. This Evelyn is just flaunting her power by taking advantage of the fact that she is Master Hart's girlfriend. Once Master Hart dumps her, let&rsquo;s not even talk about the second female lead. She won&rsquo;t even be qualified to be a fifth female lead!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily calmly said, "Alright, you don't have to tell me that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn had not given her a positive attitude since she joined the crew. Every time they met, they would find themselves in an argument.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Naturally, Lily knew that Evelyn was trying to strut her stuff in front of her to work off her feelings from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily certainly did not take Evelyn seriously. She was born in a small family but was lucky enough to attract Brian. However, it was well known in the high society that each and every one of Brian's girlfriends had a short shelf life. However, they still had no clue how many months she could remain as his girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more arrogant Evelyn was now, the more she would suffer in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The one who has a death wish is not the extra," Lily said with great interest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The assistant was surprised. It was not the extra? Then, was Lily talking about... Evelyn?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Evelyn was just troubling this small-time extra, right? What background did this extra have that Evelyn could lose out?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The one backing Evelyn was the crown prince of the entertainment industry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lily did not bother to explain either. She just rewatched the video recorded by her assistant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For Lily, such videos were a delight to watch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she did not like either Grace or Evelyn. Now that they were against each other, it was a good show for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just did not know what Jason would do about Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps without waiting for Brian and Evelyn to break up, Jason would have smashed her into smithereens. Lily felt more relaxed as she thought of this... </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Jason never played by the rules.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he was her sister's fianc&eacute;e, she could not help being afraid when she came face to face with that man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That man was so unpredictable. He could smile at you one second and make you feel hell the next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could easily change the fate of others. Even a rich family like the Atkinson family dared not offend Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just did not know how long Jason would maintain his interest in Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of this, Lily stood up and said, "All right, let's go out and have a look. It would be a pity not to see it with our own eyes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She walked out of the lounge as she spoke.</p></div>
