        <h1>Chapter 2476</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her remarks were aimed at those who were helping Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's gaze went cold. "Trusting my family is why I ended up like this. Outsiders rescued me and proved that I'm a normal person. Tell me who I&rsquo;m supposed to believe now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis, you&rsquo;ve misunderstood. You were ill at the time. The doctor's diagnosis report was clear, and there was more than one doctor involved. It&rsquo;s impossible that they were all wrong in their diagnosis, right?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, someone among the reporters exclaimed, "Gosh, a doctor confessed online that the Mitchell family bribed them, so they diagnosed Amber Mitchell to be mentally ill without going through an examination."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Gosh, really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If that's true, did the Mitchell family intend to drive their eldest daughter insane?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are the conspiracy theories online true? Did the Mitchell family imprison Amber Mitchell in a mental hospital and made her out to be a mental patient even though she was fine just to gain her shares?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Mitchell family turned pale at the conversation around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reporters even raised their microphones and asked them all kinds of tough questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A reporter asked the Mitchell family what they thought of the doctor's confession on the website while displaying the page on their phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell grabbed the phone and looked at the words on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor who confessed was Amber Mitchell's attending doctor, and the doctor even listed their financial transactions with the Mitchell family. They even claimed that they had audio recordings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The recordings had yet to be released, but Louise Mitchell was already covered in a cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is going on here? Didn't I tell the doctor to lay low for a while? I made it clear I&rsquo;d pay them a good sum of money once this is over.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this confession had now become evidence against the Mitchell family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A car drove up to the hospital&rsquo;s entrance. The bodyguards at Amber Mitchell's side immediately formed a path to let her get into the car as soon as they saw it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if the reporters wanted to interview Amber Mitchell, they were blocked by the bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell got into the car and saw Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not seem surprised by everything happening outside the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you know this was going to happen?" Amber Mitchell asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't know the Mitchell family was coming until a while ago. It's why I got the bodyguards to escort you over," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The doctor's confession online..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "We found the doctor when you were having your consultation. He confessed because we already had evidence against him. If he confessed, he could at least face a shorter sentence. When I learned that the Mitchell family was coming over, I asked the doctor to make an online statement to humiliate the Mitchell family further."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the Mitchell family had not come over today, the doctor's statement would only have been published a few days later. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked at Grace with gratitude. She had helped her more than she expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had expected to be on her own after the consultation, but now... things seemed a little different than expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "You've thanked me many times. But I can't help you much after this. I'm returning to Emerald City in a few days, but I'll introduce you to some lawyer friends before leaving. You can consult them if you have any legal problems. They&rsquo;ll help you get justice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've done so much for me," said Amber Mitchell. However, what she wanted was not only justice for herself but also&hellip; Herman.</p></div>
