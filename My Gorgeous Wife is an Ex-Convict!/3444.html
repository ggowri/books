        <h1>Chapter 3442</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." Veronica was about to answer when a hand suddenly grabbed hers. "Veronica, the bill has been paid. Do you want to go home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked up at Mason, who was holding her hand. Her face turned red and she spoke with a slightly breathless voice, "So soon?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How slow would it be otherwise? There's no queue at the cashier," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That..." She hesitated and looked at Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel saw the situation and said to Veronica, "I hope you can think about what I just said and give me an answer, is that okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's face blushed again, and after a moment, she quietly responded with a small voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason glanced at Veronica's expression, then his gaze fell on Daniel's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two boys looked at each other, and after a moment, Mason said to Veronica, "Veronica, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, okay, then..." She looked at Daniel, "Well, goodbye."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, goodbye," Daniel smiled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After parting ways at the bookstore, Daniel walked towards the bus stop. He liked Veronica, but he hadn't planned on confessing so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps it was because of Mason's words today that he made the impulsive decision, but he didn't regret it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Mason was the second son of the Reed family, it didn't matter as long as Veronica liked him. He would try his best to be with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, at this moment, Daniel didn't know how ridiculous his idea was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica and Mason were on their way back, they didn't take the subway. The Reed family's car was already parked at the bookstore's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they got into the car, Mason casually asked, "What were Mr. Cross and Veronica talking about just now? It seemed like a lot of people were looking at you guys in the bookstore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's face turned red again, "N-nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" Mason said calmly, not revealing anything. "Then what is it that Mr. Cross wants Veronica to consider?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll tell you later...," Veronica said, not wanting to make up another lie to deceive him, but also feeling embarrassed to tell the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, it seems like this is the first time she has been publicly confessed to, and the person doing the confessing is a senior she has a crush on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, then Veronica, you must definitely tell me in the future," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night, Veronica had trouble sleeping as she kept thinking about Daniel's confession. The next day, she saw Daniel again at school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel greeted her as usual, but before leaving, he reminded Veronica, "Don't forget about the thing you promised me to consider carefully!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica blushed slightly and shyly lowered her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the following days, she did see Daniel every day, but he didn't push her and seemed to give her enough time to think.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On that day, she was cleaning the area around the playground as the school was conducting a major cleaning operation. Her class was responsible for cleaning that particular area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica and a few other classmates divided up the cleaning tasks and got started right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she was sweeping the fallen leaves, someone suddenly rushed towards her and pushed her hard with their hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica fell to the ground unexpectedly and felt a sharp pain in her ankle.</p></div>
