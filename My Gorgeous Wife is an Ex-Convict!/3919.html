        <h1>Chapter 3917</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy followed the ambulance to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mother was undergoing emergency surgery, and Nancy stayed outside the operating room, praying that the surgery would be successful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Six hours later, the surgery was finally over, but when Nancy saw the doctor's regretful expression, her heart sank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Although the surgery was successful, when the patient fell, her head hit a potted plant and some fragments got stuck in her brain. Although we have removed the fragments, it is unlikely that the patient will wake up," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy stumbled, "What does that mean? Will my mother never wake up again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There is a possibility that she may become a vegetable, but of course, she may wake up soon," the doctor said, trying to comfort her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The last sentence was meant to console her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the next few days, Nancy watched her comatose mother in the hospital room, feeling a sharp pain in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mother had not woken up during these days, and many of the data indicated that there was a high possibility of her becoming a vegetable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A vegetable...this was something she had never thought of before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After leaving the hospital, she went to the police station and found out that the Schultz family claimed that her mother accidentally fell from the balcony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And there's even a maid who can prove it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How is that possible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mother was clearly pushed by Clarissa and hit the balcony railing before falling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then...what about Clarissa?! What did she say?" Nancy asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Schultz is only a witness. She also saw your mother fall, and she tried to grab her but unfortunately failed. As for your testimony that Miss Schultz pushed your mother, there is no evidence or witness to support it," the police said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, her testimony alone cannot prove anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could this be happening!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy left the police station and went straight to the Schultz family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if the maid did witness everything, her statement could only mean that she was also bribed by the Schultz family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she arrived at the Schultz family, Francis and Clarissa were both there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as they saw Nancy, their faces darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aren't you supposed to be taking care of your mother in the hospital?" Francis said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked at Francis and suddenly felt a bit unfamiliar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She used to think that Francis had genuine feelings for her mother, even though he loved his own daughter more. Otherwise, why would he marry a poor woman who even had to bring her own oil can?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, she wasn't so sure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These days, my mother is lying in the hospital. Francis only came once at the beginning and hasn't been back since it was determined that my mother was likely to become a vegetable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I went to the police station and saw the witness's testimony. It was clearly Clarissa who pushed my mother, causing her to fall. Why did the maid have to give false testimony?!" Nancy questioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"False testimony? Who said it was false?" Francis said displeasedly. "The maid only said she saw it. Your mother fell down by accident. Don't blame others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, my mother clearly..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Nancy could finish her sentence, Francis interrupted her, "Listen to me. Your mother fell down by herself. If you dare to spread rumors outside and bring any bad influence to Clarissa, don't blame me for being merciless!"</p></div>
