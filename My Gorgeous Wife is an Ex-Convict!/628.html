        <h1>Chapter 627</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything impossible was made possible because of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haven't you always wanted it reversed? Why are you quiet?" Her silence made him ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are those evidence... Really enough for me to reverse the case? Can they&hellip; Give me the truth?" murmured Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The truth... Jason's eyes unnoticeably flickered a little. "Yes, it won't be a problem. Trust me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tears welled up in her eyes, and she sobbed as she said, "Thank you, Jay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was momentarily bewildered by her tears. He quickly took a tissue to wipe her tears. "Don't cry. I didn&rsquo;t help you find evidence and reverse the case just to see you cry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her tears only made him feel pangs after pangs of pain in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she cried even harder. It was as if all those years of suffering which had been repressed by this miscarriage of justice were released at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace held the man tightly in her arms, crying loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah... Ah... Ah..." How much grievance and pain was shown through her crying as she seemed to relieve herself from it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lowered his head with a mixed look in his eyes. Looking at the person in his arms, he felt his shirt gradually getting wet. He knew they were her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart was also throbbing with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could clear her name for her, but no matter how powerful he was and how much money he had, he could not give her back the years she already lost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had he known he would have fallen in love with her and so deeply too, he would never have allowed her to suffer any injustice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a shame that he had not known earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know that his connivance would bring him guilt. He did not know that one day he would carry such a heavy burden of guilt for another person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could care less about anyone's feelings but hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raising his hand stiffly, Jason gently patted Grace on the back. He softly comforted her. "Stop crying, Grace. Stop crying, all right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He comforted her over and over again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know how long she cried for, but by the time she came to herself, the restaurant was already empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were alone in the vast and quiet restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are... The others?" She sniffed, and there was already a lump in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I told everyone else to leave. I can't have everyone else around if you keep crying like this," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was instantly embarrassed. She did not expect to lose control of her emotions and burst into tears so loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There were so many customers..." She remembered that when they came here today, the restaurant was full of people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a small matter," he said, running his fingers lightly over her tear-stained face. "Are you done crying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip slightly and responded in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took his handkerchief out and gently wiped the tear marks on her face. "I'm sorry." The two words slipped out of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never said these words to anyone else, only to her.</p></div>
