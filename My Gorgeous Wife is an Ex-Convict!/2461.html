        <h1>Chapter 2459</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From her calm voice, it seemed that she had already prepared herself for life and death. Even if she was reluctant, she had calmly arranged the future of her loved ones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the calmer she was, the angrier he became.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think it's worth sacrificing your life for a child's?" He growled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said with a wry smile, "I don't know. It's hard to say if it's worth it. But as a mother, I want to try my best to protect my children."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she chose to keep the baby even though she knew she would be in danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, you don't know. There's so much you don't know." He suddenly released his hand and looked condescendingly at her. He stared at her darkly. "Kyla, don't think I'll risk my life to save you again even if you&rsquo;re really in danger one day. I don't love you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I know that." She smiled nonchalantly. "I hope you won't save me even if I'm in danger one day. Just live a good life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was her biggest hope. She only wanted him to live a good life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly felt flustered. Her smile was so harsh to the eyes that it made his heart ache again...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell learned from Grace that Kyla needed to return to Emerald City for the baby's delivery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is Kyla okay?" Amber Mitchell asked quickly. Her voice was hoarse as she struggled to say every word. Grace knew it was because Amber Mitchell had not spoken for too long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would take some time for Amber Mitchell to get used to speaking again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's... not exactly fine, but I'll help her get through it no matter what. All you have to do now is cooperate with the specialists and prove that you're mentally sane. That way, Kyla's hard work won't be wasted," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell nodded. "Okay, I'll cooperate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Also, stay in the hospital for a few more days. Just let me know if you need anything and I'll prepare it for you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's expression changed slightly. "I... want to go somewhere. Can I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The cemetery," she slowly uttered the two words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze. Then she saw tears in Amber Mitchell's eyes. She suddenly seemed to realize something as she asked, "Do you want to see Herman Moss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell closed her eyes slowly. Tears... poured out of her eyes. She nodded her head vigorously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, she wanted to see him. She wanted to see Herman so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Herman lost his life to protect her, and she had never even paid him her respects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to meet Herman. She had so much to say to Herman. She was locked up in the hospital and could not get out to visit Herman, but now... she could.</p></div>
