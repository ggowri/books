        <h1>Chapter 738</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her quietly, then smiled softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This smile was like the melting snow mountain in spring, so beautiful that people could not look away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I believe you," said Jason as he opened his thin lips slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was sensitive and never really believed in anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he wanted to believe what she said&ndash;That she would not fail him and that she would not let him down!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hid the incident between her and Brian from him, but... He would believe her again. He would believe her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would believe what she said and believe that there was nothing between her and Brian! He would also believe that he would not follow in his father's footsteps!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He leaned forward and put his lips to hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not as soft as when she kissed him, but it was domineering. It was so domineering as if he wanted to take away all the sweetness in her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, while it was domineering, it had an endless gentleness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The gentleness was only for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time the kiss was over, Grace was barely able to stand and her face was red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you want more?" He looked at her with a wide smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face immediately became redder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly changed the subject and said, "Did you learn to pipe before? You seem to be moving fluently."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could see her intention, but he just went with it. "No, I just learned it today, but it's pretty interesting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was rendered speechless. 'All right, I have to admit that he&rsquo;s a genius, shrewd, and fierce not only when it comes to business but also when making cakes.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Piping is not that hard. It's pretty easy," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Easy?' Grace was a bit skeptical. After all, what he just piped was a rose, not a regular cream flower where you just needed to squeeze the cream out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I teach you and let you try?" He suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was a little excited to try it as they had the tools, butter, and everything in the kitchen. They did not need to prepare anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Jason demonstrated for Grace again in slow motion. He slowed down every move so that Grace could see it all clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not complicated. Jason also explained the key points clearly, and it was easy to understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, knowing how to do it was one thing while actually doing it was another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the very least, Grace found her hands completely unguided by her consciousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was done piping a rose, it did not look like a rose at all. It only looked like a lump of cream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems... Never mind. I can't do it." She smiled awkwardly, put down the tools in her hands, and unconsciously tried to put her hands behind her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, she had forgotten that her hands were not suitable for such intricate work. Her joints were bent and she could not control the strength of her fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was about to make an excuse to leave the kitchen when he suddenly reached out and pulled her hands which she had hidden behind her back.</p></div>
