        <h1>Chapter 4079</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A photographer naturally feels this way when he meets a compatible subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And it's not just Weldon who feels it, but also Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she knows it's a shoot and that she's just putting herself into the role of Medusa, the sharpness and coquettishness in her eyes, as well as the subtle teasing, are not for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They are just shooting partners.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he can't help but respond, feel, and cater to her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The shoot continues, and someone appears in a corner of the studio, watching the two in the shoot. Due to the position in the corner, it's hard to see the person's expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While Weldon adjusts Kit and Tina's poses, he catches a glimpse of the figure in the corner of his eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler really did come after all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems Chandler really does care about his fianc&eacute;e!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But whether he has feelings for his fianc&eacute;e or not is another matter, after all, Hunter's people are particularly cold-blooded!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Previously, he had sent Chandler photos of Tina and Kit while they were getting their makeup done. Now that Kit is lying on the ground and Tina is kneeling over him, he can sit back and watch the show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Weldon has Kit lie down on a floor covered in red rose petals. Tina kneels over Kit's head and lowers her head, assuming a kneeling position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The final pose has Kit's face looking up and Tina's face looking down, with their gazes meeting. If Tina lowers her head a bit more, she could kiss him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The scene is beautiful, like a fairytale come to life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like the perfect depiction of a prince and princess, making Eugenia, who is watching nearby, want to scream with excitement - if it weren't for Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, Eugenia, who was watching nearby, inadvertently turned her head and saw Chandler standing in the shadows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia's excitement and daydreams turned to shivers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wait...when did Chandler arrive?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he saw Tina taking pictures. Although they were just posing and didn't actually kiss, the intimate pose they were in...is it really okay?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was such an intimate pose that if Tina wasn't Kit's friend and if Eugenia didn't know that Tina only liked Kit as a fan, she might have thought there was something between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So...will Chandler misunderstand?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What should they do if Chandler really misunderstands?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for the fact that they were filming and there were plenty of staff around, Eugenia would have wanted to rush forward and pull her friend away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, she can only wait quietly for the shoot to end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia, who had previously thought time was flying by, now feels like every minute is agonizingly slow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, at the moment when she heard the photographer call it quits, Eugenia felt for the first time how beautiful that sound was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's take a break for now," Weldon said.</p></div>
