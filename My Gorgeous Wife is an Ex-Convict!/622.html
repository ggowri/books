        <h1>Chapter 621</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's going on here?' It was the first time that he saw Brian showing such an anxious and nervous expression because of a woman, and... He even rushed out impulsively!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What kind of woman is Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought it was just a silly conflict, even if it was over a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now... His heart was filled with a vague worry. If these two were really fighting over a woman... Emerald City would probably suffer from the sky falling and the earth opening up! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Wait a minute! Hasn&rsquo;t Brian always just been concerned about the owner of the silver bracelet?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Unless&hellip;' Patrick was suddenly a little afraid to think about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The consequences of that assumption ignited the fear in his heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian drove to the small restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Marry? Is she going to marry Jason?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even before he found out the truth... No, no, he would never allow her to marry Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had searched for her for years. He had engraved her voice and her face in his mind, bones, and blood. How could this be the result?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's hands gripped the steering wheel tightly as he sped up...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, in the small restaurant, Grace shyly mentioned to Kyla that she was going to quit her job after a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, if they were to get married, there were many things to prepare before the wedding. Besides, once she became Mrs. Reed, she would not only be representing herself, but also the Reed family. It was no longer suitable for her to continue working here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, Kyla. I didn't expect to quit so soon, but I'll wait until you have a suitable replacement for my position before resigning," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was not surprised. After learning that Grace's boyfriend was Jason, she knew that she would not be working in her small restaurant for long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was just surprised that Grace was getting married to Jason so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can come to visit when you're free. Nelson likes you very much. I'll find your replacement as soon as I can. Don't worry about it. You can always ask me for leave if anything comes up. After all, getting married is a big deal," Kyla said with some emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that the employee she recruited out of sympathy would marry Jason, a man who was so superior in Emerald City?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I like Nelson too. I'll visit you and Nelson often in the future. You, Mrs. Corbyn, and Nelson must come to my wedding," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not have many friends. There were only a few people she could invite to the wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla looked awkward when Grace said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment's hesitation, Kyla said, "I'm afraid I can&rsquo;t attend your wedding. There's going to be a lot of people, and... You know about me and Martin Weiss. I'm worried that some of the people who&rsquo;ll be attending the wedding banquet are people I've met before, then perhaps Martin Weiss will find out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace heard this and instantly understood Kyla's misgivings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to keep hiding, Kyla?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla gave a wry smile. "What else can I do? Nelson is his child. Although he never wanted this child... I'm afraid that if he finds out about Nelson and insists on taking him away, the odds are against me."</p></div>
