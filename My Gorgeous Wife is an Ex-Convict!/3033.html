        <h1>Chapter 3031</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After about 20 minutes, the Gregory family arrived, led by George.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When George saw Brian among the people with his son, he was clearly surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was one of the people who helped Amber before. Without him, Amber might not have been rescued from the Mitchell family so quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And now, did Brian save his son again? George walked up to Brian and said, "Did you help my son and prevent the traffickers from taking him away? Thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a previous phone call with the police, George learned that his son had almost been abducted by human traffickers on the street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at George in front of him. This man looked more tired and thinner than the last time he saw him. Although Grace was dressed in a suit and had neatly combed hair, there was a lifeless look in his eyes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That is a lifeless feeling that seems to only exist in people who have lost faith in life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a small favor, no need to thank me. But if you had really lost the child, Amber would probably hate you even more," said Brian. "However, today's incident can also be a lesson for the child. He should know better about danger in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When George heard the name Amber, his body trembled and his thin lips quivered. After a long time, he hoarsely asked, "Is she okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not sure, all I know is that she's in Emerald City right now," said Brian. "If you want to find out, why don't you investigate yourself? It should be easy to find out, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A bitter expression appeared on George's lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, if he investigates, he can easily find out how Amber is doing now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But... he didn't dare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because he doesn't know what kind of answer he wants to get.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she doesn't live well, he feels bad, but if she lives well, he also feels bad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And with such a large sum of money, she will probably live very well in Emerald City, which also means that she no longer needs him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To her, he is just the person who causes her pain! If it weren't for their child, who is a common bond between them, she would probably want to treat him like a stranger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George approached Simon and Valda, glanced at Valda, then at Brian, and asked Brian, "Who is this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My girlfriend, Valda," Brian introduced, then turned to Valda and said, "Valda, this is Simon Gregory's father, George."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George was surprised to learn that Valda was Brian's girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, men like Brian have many options when it comes to finding a girlfriend, such as high society ladies or popular female celebrities. However, Valda appears quite ordinary in comparison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's gaze towards Valda was gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This made George realize that Brian truly cares about this woman, with genuine feelings rather than casual dating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The atmosphere surrounding the two individuals is relaxed and pleasant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, there was a similar atmosphere between him and Amber, but... it was ultimately shattered by his own hands.</p></div>
