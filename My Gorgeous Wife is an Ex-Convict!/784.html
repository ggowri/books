        <h1>Chapter 783</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was startled. She could tell something was wrong from Grace&rsquo;s voice. "What's wrong? Did something happen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. I'll tell you about it some other day." Grace tried hard to make herself sound natural. "Please tell Nelson I'm sorry that I can't treat him to cake today. I'll buy him a cake some other day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you&rsquo;re facing any difficulties, come to me. I may not be able to help you much, but it's good to have one more person for advice," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought of Grace as a friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since her release from prison, she had left her hometown to avoid Martin Weiss and cut off ties with all her former friends. It was safe to say that she only had a few friends around her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only person she could call a friend was Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, Kyla. Don't worry. I'll be alright," said Grace before finally ending the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, I'll be alright. I just got my heart broken again. I just fell from heaven to hell yet again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, it's not hell. At least it's better than the last time I was wrongly imprisoned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now, at least I'm free to go wherever I want and do whatever I want!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Instead of just sitting in jail where I get punched and kicked, having to live every day in fear!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the phone that was in her hand. It was her old phone from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had broken the new phone Jason bought her on the hill yesterday, so she put her sim card back into the old phone she had switched from but could not bear to throw away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Look, in the end, she left as she came. Her phone, clothes, luggage, shoes, and socks were all her old belongings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was like Cinderella, getting beaten back to her true self once it was past midnight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a silver-grey Porsche pulled to a temporary stop near the bus stop. Lina got out of the car quickly and ran up to Grace. "Grace, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's eyes turned red as she looked at her friend who was dressed in old clothes and had two suitcases at her feet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's Grace's birthday today! It's supposed to be a happy day for Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, why did this happen to my best friend?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace slowly raised her head and looked at Lina with a faint smile. "There you are. I... moved out of Reed Residence, but... I don't know where to go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her smile made Lina even sadder. "Come on. Get in the car first," said Lina. After all, the bus stop was not a place for conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin got out of the car and helped Grace carry the two suitcases into it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina pulled Grace into the backseat of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, Lina said nothing but squeezed her best friend's hand tightly. Grace's hand was so cold when it was clearly the hottest season of the year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had nowhere to go. Her rental house had long since been surrendered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin found a hotel for Grace to let her stay at temporarily. However, Grace asked Hadwin to book her a cheap inn instead.</p></div>
