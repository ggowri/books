        <h1>Chapter 2810</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was still stupefied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had only glanced at the baby briefly when she was born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she gave birth, the baby spent so much time in the neonatal unit that he could only look at her through the glass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe he subconsciously thought he would get attached to the baby and become reluctant to part with her the longer he looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I'm going to wash up. Hold her for a while if she wakes up and starts crying. She'll stop crying as long as someone's carrying her," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned slightly. 'Hold... the little one?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it." Speaking of which, he had never held her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla went into the bathroom to wash up. When she was done and opened the bathroom door, she heard her daughter crying. Martin Weiss was carrying the baby in a fluster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hurried forward. When Martin Weiss saw her, he immediately asked, "Didn't you say she'd stop crying as long as someone was holding her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "That's usually the case. It's probably because... she's not familiar with you. Also, she might be uncomfortable with the way you&rsquo;re carrying her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The way I&rsquo;m carrying her?" Martin Weiss frowned. The baby's cries kept ringing in his ears. In particular, her face was similar to her mother's, which made him exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stepped forward to help him adjust how he carried the baby. "Put your hands like this... Also, you have to hold her neck. Babies' necks are soft. If she&rsquo;s crying really hard, you can give her an airplane hug. She loves it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Airplane hug?" Martin Weiss looked confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Put her on her stomach and support her stomach and neck with one hand while the other protects..." Kyla began explaining the essentials of airplane hugs for babies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss finally gave the little one an airplane hug, the baby, who had been crying, stopped crying and giggled after a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The baby enjoyed her father's hug.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes could not help watering at the sight in front of her. She had dreamed of this many times, but it unexpectedly happened when she was destined to divorce Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked over at her as if sensing something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly looked away and said, "Hold Trista a little longer. I'll prepare her baby formula. It's almost time to feed her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she hurried to the side and took out the baby formula to prepare it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the baby formula was mixed and the temperature almost reached the temperature suitable for babies, Kyla walked over to Martin Weiss with the milk bottle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to try feeding her?" she asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had wanted him to give her the baby and feed her herself, but her words turned out the other way for some reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss seemed slightly surprised. "Me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... If you're unwilling, I'll do it..." she said and tried to take the baby from his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of giving the baby to her, he stopped giving the baby an airplane hug and sat on the couch beside him. He held the baby in his arms, reached out one hand to Kyla, and said, "Give me the bottle."</p></div>
