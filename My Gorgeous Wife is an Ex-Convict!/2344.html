        <h1>Chapter 2342</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What about now? Why was he peeling shrimps for her again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He should not have feelings for her anymore. Besides, she had something to ask of him. What was his purpose in peeling the shrimps for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once he finished peeling a shrimp, he put it into her bowl. Instead of eating it, she just stared blankly at the peeled shrimp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you not going to eat it?" His voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her lips together and took a deep breath. "Martin Weiss, are you trying to get back at me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes narrowed as he glared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren&rsquo;t you trying to get back at me because I ruthlessly chose to separate from you and trampled on your pride?" she looked up at him and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He asked grimly, &ldquo;Do you think I'm trying to get back at you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have no feelings for me, but you&rsquo;re peeling shrimps for me." She smiled sadly. "Your gentleness makes me wonder if you want me to fall in love with you again so you can make me suffer the pain of unrequited love.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face was cold. "So?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to get back at me, that&rsquo;s fine. But I hope you&rsquo;ll do it after the baby is safely born. Also, as your mother said, you can find other ways to convict Jacqueline Bowman later as long as you spare her for now. If you agree... you can get back at me however you want," she said, ready to risk everything. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss sneered. "Kyla, you're so conceited!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He got up and walked away abruptly, leaving Kyla alone at the table as she looked at the table full of food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled ruefully. Perhaps everything she said now would be wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her chopsticks gently picked up the shrimp he had just peeled for her. She put it in her mouth. Why did she feel like crying when she was clearly eating something that should be delicious?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was standing in front of the mirror at the bathroom sink. He looked at himself in the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out his gentleness reminded her of revenge! However... even he could not explain why he peeled the shrimps for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed like a natural thing to do. It was as if his body wanted to take care of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How poor and pathetic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had chosen to forget the relationship. He should not feel anything when she stood in front of him, but his body could not help itself sometimes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He chuckled, but it sounded so bitter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the meal, Martin Weiss sent Kyla back to the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Forget about making a deal with my mother. If I don't want to spare Jacqueline Bowman, no one can persuade me otherwise," Martin Weiss said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... if I keep begging you, will you say yes?" she asked, her dark eyes looking at him longingly and expectantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together tightly without answering and left the hotel room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes darkened. Perhaps it was the end of her L City trip. Perhaps she would not get any results! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla could not sleep that night. Her thoughts were occupied with Amber Mitchell's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since it was a dead-end with Martin Weiss, she could only return to Emerald City and find other ways.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she was almost due for her check-up.</p></div>
