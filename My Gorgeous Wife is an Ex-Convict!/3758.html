        <h1>Chapter 3756</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica had the urge to vomit blood. How could this person in front of her say such suggestive words with a straight face?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, of course not!" she quickly replied, but because she spoke too fast, she accidentally bit her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" She couldn't help but cry out in pain, and tasted a bloody taste in her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Did you bite your tongue?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm-hmm," she replied vaguely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me see," he said, naturally lifting his hand and holding her chin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>See what? Her tongue? Veronica felt embarrassed, but at this moment, Mason looked serious, as if he wouldn't allow her to object.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her mouth shyly, timidly sticking out her tongue, telling herself in her heart that it was like a doctor examining a patient!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay...that's enough," she said in a muffled voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't talk for now," he said, lightly brushing his fingertip over her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shuddered and suddenly closed her mouth, blushing as she looked at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's a bit cut, but it's not a big deal. But don't eat anything hot later when we have dinner. Oh, and Zack, stop the car here," he said as the car came to a stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason got out of the car and said to Veronica, "Wait for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked puzzled. After a moment, Mason came back quickly, holding a bag in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once he got into the car, he opened the bag and Veronica realized that he had gone to buy ice cream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eating some ice cream can help stop bleeding and relieve pain," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he had gotten off the car earlier to buy ice cream for her? Looking at the ice cream in front of her, Veronica suddenly felt an indescribable emotion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it gratitude? Happiness? Or perhaps a long-buried feeling?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car arrived at Veronica's apartment building and Mason followed her into her small apartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you having dinner here?" Veronica asked, checking the time. It was about time </span><span>to start preparing dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," Mason replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What would you like to eat?" she asked, opening the fridge and checking the ingredients that could be cooked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anything is fine," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Veronica picked a few dishes and cooked two dishes and a soup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, how did you happen to come to the school at that time today?" she couldn't help but ask, especially since the timing was so perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was the principal of your school. He knew that you had some relationship with our family, so he wanted to talk to you about dropping out. The principal called my mom, and then my mom told me," Mason explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was shocked. Even Auntie Grace knew about this?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, if you had told me from the beginning, things wouldn't have escalated to this point. Even if you didn't want to pay attention to rumors, it doesn't mean that every rumor should be ignored," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry to trouble you," Veronica apologized.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was originally my mess to clean up, so it's only right that I take care of it," Mason replied. "But even though you don't like using money to pressure people, I won't let the person who intentionally blew this up get away with it."</span></p></div>
