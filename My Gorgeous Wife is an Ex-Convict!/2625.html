        <h1>Chapter 2623</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she was a comic artist who had her own studio and she had saved up some money after years of hard work, the food here was rather expensive to her. A simple dish here costs hundreds of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"See if there's anything you want," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated slightly and ordered two simple dishes. Hence, Brian ordered more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once the manager exited the private room, she asked, "Are you rich?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian replied, "I suppose I have some money to spend. As for the price of dating me, I can satisfy anything you want as long as it's reasonable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When you say dating, does it entail being affectionate in front of others?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Yes, it might involve holding hands and hugging, but nothing more. Of course, you can refuse me now if you find it inappropriate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Refuse?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller gazed at the person in front of her. Moments later, she said, "Although you said it doesn't matter who you choose to be your girlfriend when I asked you why you chose me the last time, won&rsquo;t it be more convenient if you get someone you're familiar with to help you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thick black lashes quivered a little as those dark phoenix eyes met her round and clear eyes. "You once said you loved someone, but you've withdrawn all your feelings and stopped loving him. Is that right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you can withdraw your feelings for someone you once loved, I don't have to worry about hurting you too much. Even if you fall in love with me during this fake relationship, you can withdraw your feelings and stop loving me. It won&rsquo;t be too troublesome," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze. He seemed to be saying the words&hellip; "Are you afraid I'll fall in love with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark phoenix eyes remained indifferent. "Because I&rsquo;ll never fall in love with you, so you&rsquo;d better not fall in love with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A strange feeling suddenly flickered through her heart. 'Who had a man like him fallen in love with?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, you can request anything you want if you haven't changed your mind. What do you want?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller pondered slightly before taking a deep breath and saying, "I want to draw you. If possible, I hope you&rsquo;ll be my model for some time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Draw me?" Surprise flickered in his eyes as if he did not expect such a request from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I'm starting a new comic. I'm doing some research for preliminary plot planning and character development, so I want to draw you to get some inspiration," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Inspiration?" His eyes narrowed a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, because you have a dreamy face that gives me the urge to draw you." She stared somewhat infatuatedly at him as she spoke, already imagining what the face would look like as a character in a comic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not feel as upset as he normally did when he was being stared at infatuatedly by a woman. Maybe it was because her gaze was too pure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she was only obsessed with his face and nothing else, not to mention other desires and ambitions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If that's what you want as exchange, then sure," his cold voice answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian sent Valda Theller back to her place at night, she was still slightly distracted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she... really dating this guy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Then we'll meet three times a week starting tomorrow. Is that alright? The relationship isn't real, but we must at least get acquainted."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, sure," she answered quickly.</p></div>
