        <h1>Chapter 1915</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she was unusually at ease because he was here! As long as he was around, it seemed that she had nothing to worry about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace muttered, "Jay, you saved me again. If Katherine Jackson... wasn&rsquo;t distracted just now, you... wouldn&rsquo;t have seriously stripped naked, would you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could not help asking the question even though every word she said caused her pain due to the wounds on her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He fixed his dark eyes on her. "What if I say that was exactly what I was planning? If she wasn't distracted, I would&rsquo;ve continued taking off my clothes. As long as your life was in her hands and I couldn&rsquo;t find the opportunity to do anything, then even if she told me to lie down like a dog, I would do it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at Jason with her eyes full of shock. Would such a proud man go that far for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Don't you believe me? Don't you believe I would go that far?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She shook her head with difficulty. "No... No..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It doesn't matter whether you believe it. I would do anything to save you, but what about you? If I got into danger one day, would you do anything to save me too?" he said, but he seemed to be talking to himself. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not intend to wait for her answer at all. He carried her to the bottom of the rope ladder, carefully placed her on the ground where there were a lot of cracks now. He told her to get on her feet before pulling the rope ladder over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, there was another huge explosion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Jason's bodies shook. The cracks on the rooftop floor beneath them were getting bigger and bigger. The whole building was in danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With another explosion, the ground beneath Grace's feet collapsed and her body instantly started to fall. However, another hand grabbed her hand firmly and stopped her from falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It's... Jay's hand! He caught me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace struggled to raise her head, only to see Jason grabbing her hand tightly with one hand and pulling the helicopter's rope ladder with the other. He was exerting his strength to pull her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the cracks on the rooftop floor beneath his feet were also spreading. They would collapse at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The explosions continued. A bigger and bigger expanse of the rooftop floor around them collapsed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On this rooftop that would collapse at any time, he could not find a force-bearing point at all. It was impossible to pull her up with one hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace knew this very well! The only way was for him to grab her with both hands!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he was holding onto the rope ladder with his other hand. If he let go of it, they would both fall together!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All of a sudden, all sorts of images flashed across Grace's mind. The conclusion she came to was... "Jay, remember to bring up Mick, Jasper, and Mason well. Mason... needs more patience from you... Also, tell them that I've gone somewhere very far and that it&rsquo;ll be a long time before I come back. When they're older, tell them... the truth..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace struggled to speak as crimson blood-soaked the cloth around her neck. The blood dripped down the fabric.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason suddenly turned pale, and he snapped. "Stop it, Grace! I&rsquo;m telling you to stop! I'll get you out of here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It's almost she's giving her last wishes! She can't leave me!' This was everything Jason was thinking about.</p></div>
