        <h1>Chapter 1533</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked like a sculpture. He frowned a little when he saw Grace come in. "Why is it you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You just need someone to bring the child out, right? What difference does it make whether it's me or Terrence?" said Grace. Her nose started to feel sore again when she looked at the person in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence told her earlier that after she &lsquo;died&rsquo;, Jason had held her ashes miserably and almost went crazy. Though she had not seen it, her heart ached with anguish just listening to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">How much did this man love her? He once said he would give her his life, and he did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence also said that when Jay had to choose who to save between her and himself when she was trapped in the car, he even recorded his last words on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The man loved her with his life. It was just that he... had forgotten all about it! He forgot just how much he loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it was enough that he was alive. It was her turn to make him love her again this time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace walked forward step by step. "Jasper must like you, or she wouldn't have fallen asleep on you like this," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He pressed his thin lips together lightly. "Take her away. I have work to do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, instead of taking her away immediately, she said, "You like her too, don't you?" She knew him so well. If he disliked her, he would not be holding her like this even if she was a child&mdash;let alone let her put her arms around his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason suddenly chuckled and said somewhat sarcastically, "Why do you say so?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her red lips parted gently. "Because you never let people touch your neck easily." To him, it meant putting his life into the hands of another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Previously when she put her arms around his neck, he had said, "You know what? Only you can put your hands around my neck like this. No one else can because my carotid artery is here. Having someone pressing against it is just like putting my life in another's hands."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he was willing to let his daughter put her little hands on his neck. It was a sign that he had let down his guard against his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's expression sank. 'Had I&hellip; told her that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if she knew him well, yet he did not know her at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's enough. Don't think you know me very well. Even if you did back then, it's been five years. You don't know how I've changed in these five years," he said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Yeah, it has been five years.' Grace took a deep breath, "Can I get to know you again now? I&rsquo;ve asked Terrence. You haven't fallen in love with any other woman in the past five years, so you can get to know me again. Perhaps you'll discover that I'm a decent wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes narrowed slightly as he stared at her intently. Moments later, the corners of his lips slowly raised. He said with a half-smile, "What's the matter? Do you want me to fall in love with you again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her almond-shaped eyes met his. "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her straightforward answer startled him a little. Her &lsquo;yes&rsquo; made his heart flutter as if it meant a lot to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His heart beat faster and faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though he tried desperately to slow down his heartbeat, his body was not under his control at all.</p></div>
