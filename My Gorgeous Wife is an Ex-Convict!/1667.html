        <h1>Chapter 1665</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes were dark, and he told his subordinate coldly, "I want her to be unable to throw anything with her hands ever again. Once you're done, hand her over to the police."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," the subordinate replied. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The cleaner panicked. 'Are... Are they going to break my hands? I'd rather they just hand me over to the police.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Forgive me. I won't do it again, I... I'll surrender myself to the police..." However, Jason's face was still frosty no matter how much she begged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'This woman should be thankful that Grace didn&rsquo;t get hurt today. Otherwise, it won&rsquo;t be enough to make up for it even if she were to die countless deaths! Let alone having her hands broken!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Ignoring the woman's wailing, Jason left the place while Terrence rushed to catch up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two of them got into a car parked outside, and Terrence handed a document to Jason. "Young master Reed, this is Sean's information from the past few years. Sean is now a deliveryman and unexpectedly saved Young Madam today. But he broke his wrist, and Young Madam had someone send him to the hospital for treatment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked through the materials in his hands with a grim look in his eyes, and the atmosphere in the car seemed depressing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What a coincidence," Jason's voice suddenly rang out in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes... Yes, what a coincidence." Terrence started sweating on his forehead, and he seemed to have heard a trace of jealousy in his boss' voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is Young master Reed... jealous... because Sean saved Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is there any surveillance footage of the scene?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes." Terrence quickly took out his phone, clicked on a video clip his subordinate had sent, and showed it to his boss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the video, Sean sprinted up from behind and held Grace before both of them fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was a long time before the two got up again, and they started conversing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes deepened. His eyes were still on the phone screen when the video ended. He seemed to be thinking of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence could only continue holding the phone even though the video had already finished playing. He carefully looked at his boss. 'Is Young master Reed really jealous?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">While Terrence was hesitating whether he should tell his boss that nothing was going on between Grace and Sean, Jason's cold voice rang again...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you think Grace will sympathize with Sean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Huh?' Terrence was a little stunned. "Sympathize?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Women tend to be compassionate, don't they? Sean was Grace's ex-boyfriend, after all. Do you think she&rsquo;ll sympathize with Sean?" Those dark peach blossom eyes seemed to stare at Terrence nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence felt a chill running down his spine at that moment. Sean would probably meet a terrible end if he said yes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Young master Reed's definitely jealous!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Well... probably not. After all, Young Madam didn't beg for the Stevens family when you went after them and the Atkinson family," Terrence said cautiously.</p></div>
