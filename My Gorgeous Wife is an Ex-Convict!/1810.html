        <h1>Chapter 1808</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, I'll take you to your mommy," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason, who was standing beside them said, "I'll take him. The doctor said you should stay at home and rest. You shouldn't move your hands. Otherwise, they won't recover."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace thought about it for a moment and nodded. "Okay then. You can take William."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason had arranged for William to see Lily at two o&rsquo;clock. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the back seat of the Bentley, William sat quietly beside Jason, just like a quiet doll.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason was a little impressed with the child's temperament. It was hard to conceive that someone like Lily had raised a child like him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This child was only five years old but was able to keep a calm composure and even asked to see his mother&rsquo;s body after she committed suicide. Not many adults had such temperament.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Such a person was either born indifferent or... he knew how to control his temper and possessed shrewdness that did not belong to kids his age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, which was he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason was suddenly a little curious about the child's father. The child was good-looking, but he did not resemble Lily much. In other words, the child looked more like his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he had people search Lily's records, he failed to find out who the child's biological father was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lily's body was temporarily stored at the funeral home because it had been forensically examined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason asked the worker to take William to see Lily's body while he walked to another room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he reached the room, the head of the funeral home was already waiting there. As soon as he saw Jason, he bowed and said, "Mr. Reed, have a seat. Everything has been arranged just as you ordered."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," Jason replied indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Right in front of his chair was a large electronic screen with several split screens. They showed the same room that contained a coffin. Inside it lay Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Soon, two figures entered the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">One of them was a funeral home worker, while the other was William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The worker seemed to say something to William, and the little one walked over to the coffin and quietly looked at Lily, who was lying inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">No one knew what the kid was thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason stared thoughtfully at the screen as if he was thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For half an hour, the little one merely looked at his mother without shedding a tear or saying anything. Then, he turned to the worker who had brought him here and said, "Uncle, I'm done seeing my mommy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The worker took William out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason got up and turned to the head of the funeral home, saying, "Ask the Atkinson family to claim the body."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," the head of the funeral home replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason got back into the car, and William came over after a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car slowly drove away from the funeral home.</p></div>
