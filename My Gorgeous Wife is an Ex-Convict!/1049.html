        <h1>Chapter 1048</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In particular, most of the boy bands were produced by Hart Group's talent agency.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina kept telling him that he was the most handsome and best-looking man, and she was crazy about him. However, she watched their videos all the time, making him grit his teeth in jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he tried to hide her phone from her, she would put on a pitiful look and say that she only had such one hobby she enjoyed in life. When he heard this, he would be embarrassed for having used such forceful means.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson felt that Lina had him by the short hairs!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect you to be interested in these things, President Stephenson," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The corners of Hadwin Stephenson's mouth twitched. "I just think there are too many boy bands, but most of them are similar. I hope your company can consider producing more girl groups."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was not interested in women. It would be alright if they produced more girl groups.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his eyebrows as if he was surprised to hear Hadwin Stephenson say such words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You seem to care a lot about the entertainment industry, President Stephenson. Do you have a girl group you fancy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Hadwin Stephenson could speak, Lina's voice rang. "Hmm? Hadwin, which girl group do you fancy? Why haven't I heard you mention this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson had a headache. He did not want to make himself a joke in front of outsiders, so he said, "Didn&rsquo;t you want to meet some celebrities tonight? I saw a few just now. Do you want me to take you to them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh? Who are they?" Lina's eyes lit up immediately. Then, she gestured to Grace that she would see her later and quickly followed Hadwin Stephenson to &lsquo;meet&rsquo; the celebrities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it was why she attended the charity gala today!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked over to Brian and said, "You&hellip; Uh... Don't have to worry about me. I can do just fine here by myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "It's alright. I'll stay here with you. By the way, is your friend a fan?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah." Grace could not help smiling at the mention of Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at her smiling face in jealousy. He could see that she was important to her. 'When will she smile because of me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you smile because of me one day?" The words escaped Brian's mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Grace had not wrapped her head around it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing." Brian smiled faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a figure suddenly came over. "Brian, didn't you say you wouldn't attend the gala? Why..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Halfway through the sentence, Stella realized it was Grace standing next to Brian. The words were immediately stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, why are you here with Brian?" Stella glared at Grace. There was jealousy in her eyes, especially after seeing the purple gown she was wearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had her eye on the gown for a while now and even asked Brian to give it to her, but Brian bought her another purple dress instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the other dress was also expensive, this particular purple gown was still on her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect Grace to be wearing it today.</p></div>
