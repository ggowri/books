        <h1>Chapter 2978</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, there was a fierce and icy aura emanating from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman felt uneasy in her heart, and his gaze made her feel afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... just wait and see!" The woman said angrily before turning and running away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The onlookers were somewhat surprised as they looked at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian didn't pay attention to the surrounding gazes. He just turned his head to look at Valda, and in an instant, the fierceness on him turned into tenderness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda blinked. "What are you apologizing for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just now, you already stood up for me, didn't you?" Valda said. She wasn't affected by the woman's insults just now, having experienced bullying in college before. A few insults were like a drizzle to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Brian's apologetic face, she smiled and said, "Don't worry, I have a strong psychological endurance, and you're my boyfriend. You just made me proud by telling her to leave like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you really okay?" He was afraid that the woman's words had affected her mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine, don't worry. And, you protected me just now, so I'm really happy now," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like in the midst of wind and rain, finally someone stood in front of her and helped her block all the ups and downs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian finally felt relieved after hearing her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When it was finally their turn, Brian looked at the menu and couldn't decide which flavor of crayfish to order.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You order, I'm fine with anything," he said, since he hadn't eaten anything before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda readily agreed and ordered three small portions of crayfish, each with a different flavor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"These three flavors are all pretty good in my opinion, you should try them. Oh, and what drink do you want?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just the same as you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about other small dishes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't mind, whatever you order, I'll just eat along with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, Valda ordered some drinks and a few appetizers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In no time, all the dishes were served. Valda looked at the plates of crayfish and suddenly her appetite increased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian poured drinks for the two of them and then watched as Valda demonstrated how to peel a small lobster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Here, this is how you peel it. Do you understand? The head is also delicious, but only eat the yellow paste..." She explained, since this was his first time eating crayfish, she felt a great responsibility as his "guide".</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I understand." He smiled and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So the two of them started eating the crawfish. Valda put the first one she had just peeled into Brian's mouth and eagerly asked, "Is it delicious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled slightly and said, "Not bad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That's good! She breathed a sigh of relief, after all, when you like something, you naturally hope that he will think it's okay too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them were eating, but most of the time, it turned into Brian peeling the shrimp and Valda eating them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to eat too? Don't just keep peeling for me," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm still eating," he said, "I can peel it faster this way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Indeed, she agreed with what he said. In just a short amount of time, he had surpassed her in the skill of peeling shrimp shells, which she had previously excelled at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And not only was he faster at shelling than her, but his movements were also much more elegant than hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She peeled it off, using only her claws to remove the shrimp shell, which she peeled off quite brutally. On the other hand, his peeling was a sight to behold! The shrimp shell was removed neatly and cleanly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda feels that her boyfriend is so artistic that even peeling a shrimp feels like a scene from a movie.</p></div>
