        <h1>Chapter 2036</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla pressed her lips together. She knew what her mother was worried about, but... "Mom, I&rsquo;ll save enough money for my retirement. Nelson is also a filial kid. He'll take care of me when I'm old, so you have nothing to worry about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, tell me the truth. Do you... still have feelings for Martin Weiss? Is he the reason you can't move on?" asked Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was silent. Martin Weiss was like an indelible mark to her. Though she had no feelings for Martin Weiss now, she still could not forget him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, he was such a major part of her life. He was even the one who crushed her ability to love someone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could not bring herself to start a new relationship. Once bitten, twice shy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, it's true that I can't get over what happened in the past, but I don't love Martin Weiss anymore. I know that better than anyone. Running a small business like this and being with you and Nelson is the life I want!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn sighed and said nothing else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At the marriage registration office, Lina and Hadwin Stephenson had filled in their registration forms, taken their photos, and were waiting to take their vows. They could only get their marriage license after taking their vows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Lina could sense many people's eyes on her and Hadwin Stephenson while they waited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, she had a protruding belly, and Hadwin Stephenson was attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Many brides and grooms, who were also waiting to take their vows, would look at them and whisper to each other from time to time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina whispered to Hadwin Stephenson as well, "When the tabloids report our marriage, do you think everyone will say that you were forced to marry me because I&rsquo;m pregnant?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina meant it as a joke and did not overthink it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson glanced sideways at her. "That can only mean they don't know me. I've never been the type to have a shotgun marriage. No one can carry my child unless I want them to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze. "Did I get pregnant because..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes darkened. "Since I'm willing to let you do that, I'm ready to have a child with you. I only want children of my and your blood, not anyone else&rsquo;s!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He never wanted another woman to bear his children, and no woman could force him into a shotgun marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He wanted to get married because he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina immediately found her nose feeling a little sore. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When it was their turn to go on the platform to take their vows, Lina said her vows word by word. However, all she heard was Hadwin Stephenson's melodious voice saying the same vows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"From this day onward, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">From now on, she was his wife, and he was her husband...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin, I love you!" Lina said to Hadwin Stephenson as she looked at the marriage license in her hands when they returned to the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What should you call me now?" Hadwin Stephenson asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze. Then, she came back to her senses and said, "... Darling." Although she had already accepted him as her husband, she still blushed when that word escaped her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Good girl, dear," said Hadwin Stephenson as he leaned over. He gently raised Lina's chin with one hand, and his thin lips kissed her on the lips. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No matter what happens in the future, I&rsquo;ll give you my everything as long as you call me &lsquo;darling&rsquo;," he said hoarsely. It was as if he could not kiss her enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I can also give you my everything. No matter what happens in the future, we must be honest and not have any misunderstandings, okay?" muttered Lina.</p></div>
