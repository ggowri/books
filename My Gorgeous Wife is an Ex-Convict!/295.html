        <h1>Chapter 294</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She trembled and slowly raised her head, almost stiffly, to look at the person in front of her. Her wet black eyes seemed to slowly gain focus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, can you help me find Lina?" She seemed to come to her senses just then. She hurriedly said, "The police just filed a case. They said they'll send someone to look for her, but they don't know when they'll find her. If only I remember the license plate number... Why didn&rsquo;t I pay more attention?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a note of remorse in her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared at Grace. He had only ever seen her so anxious when something happened to her grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her grandmother was her relative, but Lina? She was someone who was not related to her, yet she was still so worried about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A wave of jealousy suddenly rose in his heart. He was jealous that she was so worried about Lina. What about him? Would she be so worried about him if anything had happened to him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go home first. It's cold here," he said. "Look how cold your hands are."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it cold? She did not feel anything. All she could think about was how to find Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will... Will you help me find Lina?" she asked, wanting to get a definite answer. She could only wait for the police, but... if he was willing to help, they could find Lina soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he had a lot of connections and resources in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go back and talk about it. Even if I'm going to find her for you, I'll have to go back and hear all the details before contacting someone to find her for you, right?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, if it's too late, then... Lina could be in danger." She stared at him in the moonlight with her black eyes that seemed to be stained with water. Her look of anxiety and bloodless cheeks stung him like needles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I beg you. Get&hellip; Get someone to find Lina's whereabouts now, all right? If anything happens to Lina, I... " Her teeth bit on her lip firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, nothing will happen to Lina! Nothing will happen to her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She kept saying to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you that anxious to find her? Since you haven't received any information on her and her parents haven't reported this to the police, then perhaps nothing has happened to her?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Something must have happened to her! Otherwise, she would have called me!" However, so far, her best friend had not called.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you care about her so much?" he asked in a deep voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she replied with hardly any hesitation. However, her answer made him feel worse. It felt like thick needles that continued to sting him non-stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even the pallor of her face struck him as unsightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I don't want to help you find her? What are you going to do?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes widened sharply, and her lips quivered. Even her thin body was trembling. Her hands clenched the phone so tightly that her fingers almost seemed to be embedded in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not bear to see her like that.</p></div>
