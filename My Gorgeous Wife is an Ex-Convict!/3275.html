        <h1>Chapter 3273</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace and Lina, looking at Amber, also had a touch of heartache. This was because when Amber was pregnant, she was in a mental hospital and was even deceived into believing that she had given birth to a stillborn child. If it weren't for Amber's kind blood donation to Simon later on, this truth might have been buried forever. Fortunately, in the end, justice was served for Amber, and the person who framed her received the punishment they deserved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda didn't know about this, so she looked at them with some confusion, but seeing the sadness on Amber's face, she wisely didn't ask too much. It must not be a happy thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I wonder which lucky baby will be your and Brian's child. Do you mind if this child has one more godmother?" Amber brought up a new topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda smiled and said, "Of course not, I would be delighted."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I want to be a godmother too!" Lina naturally followed suit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace and Kyla exchanged a smile and said, "Don't forget about us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An unborn baby already has a bunch of people making appointments to be its godmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other side, where Brian is, a few men are discussing pregnancy and its related issues, which is quite different from the godmother appointment on this side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Single birth?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, a single fetus," Brian said. "Fortunately, being a single fetus means the risk is much lower."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once there are multiple fetuses, the risks that Valda would have to bear would be much greater. Therefore, he was relieved to find out that it was a single fetus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's not necessarily true," Jason said. After all, when Grace was pregnant with their fourth child, she was also carrying only one baby, but the risk was still present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin and Hadwin, who were standing aside, also agreed with Jason's words and nodded in agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For them, their wife was also a single birth, but she almost didn't make it off the operating table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian seemed to have realized this too, and his face turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda's physical examination seems to be fine, right? She doesn't have any hidden illnesses, does she?" Martin looked at Brian, who had a pale complexion, and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, the results of the physical examination were pretty good," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That should reduce the risk significantly," said Martin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"......" Brian looked at the other person, was this supposed to be comforting?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin said, "You and Valda, you don't have any enemies, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian frowned, "Do business competitors count as enemies?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mainly those enemies in the emotional aspect, such as unrequited love, like the arranged marriage partner your family chose for you, or your ex-girlfriend," said Hadwin. "You need to be careful of these people and watch out for their actions."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the beginning, he was targeted by his "ex-girlfriend" and almost lost Lina because of her actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Brian could even say the word "no", Jason spoke up, "I remember you having quite a few ex-girlfriends, right?"</p></div>
