        <h1>Chapter 3685</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the group arrived at the backstage area, there was a security guard at the entrance. Many people were coming and going, and everyone needed to show their ID to enter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A middle-aged man in a sharp suit saw Chandler and immediately approached them, saying, "Mr. Hunter, you've finally arrived. This must be your fianc&eacute;e. Derick is so lucky to have such a fan."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled at Tina, who was holding hands with Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only knew that Chandler was bringing his fianc&eacute;e to meet Derick today, but he didn't know anything else, so he naturally didn't know Jasmine and Mason's identities either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he knew, he would probably be even more surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These two are..." The middle-aged man looked at the Reed siblings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My friends," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, please follow me," the middle-aged man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group followed him to the backstage area and entered one of the restrooms, where Derick was waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Derick, this is Mr. Hunter that I told you about. His fianc&eacute;e is your fan and loves your music," the middle-aged man said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derick raised an eyebrow and looked surprised. This middle-aged man was the CEO of his company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Usually, the CEO was very aloof in front of others, so why was he bowing and scraping now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then he remembered that the CEO had mentioned that Mr. Hunter was from the Crypt families, so he could understand the CEO's attitude now. He was just surprised that Mr. Hunter's fianc&eacute;e was so... small!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looks like a primary school student? Or maybe a junior high school student?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, I'm Derick." Despite his surprise, Derick has seen a lot of the world and quickly suppressed his astonishment. He gracefully extended his hand and greeted the other person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Chandler could respond, Tina eagerly shook Derick's hand and grinned, "Hello, my name is Tina. I'm your fan. You sing really well, and I love listening to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," Derick said. This girl in front of him was very likable, especially when she smiled and revealed her little tiger teeth, which looked particularly interesting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, the other person's gaze at him was frank and sincere, completely different from the gazes of the women who usually surrounded him, which gave Derick a different feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm also your fan!" Jasmine on the side quickly added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derick raised his eyebrows, and she was an even smaller fan.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The fans he usually met were at least high school students or even older. He hadn't really met such young girls face to face before, so it was quite novel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello!" Derick said with a smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you give me an autograph?" Jasmine quickly took out the autograph board that she had prepared long ago and added, "Can you sign it 'TO'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course." Derick smiled and asked as he wrote on the autograph board, "What's your name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasmine," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pen in Derick's hand suddenly stopped. "Jasmine?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Jasmine," she said, repeating her name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Derick shuddered. Today, he had also seen news online that it was the 11th birthday of Jasmine, the fourth Miss of the Reed family. So...the Jasmine in front of him should be that person?</span></p></div>
