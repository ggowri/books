        <h1>Chapter 1680</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean's pupils suddenly constricted. "Did... Did you hear what I said to her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked indifferent. "So what if I did? Sean, if you dare appear in front of her and say such nonsense again, or have anything to do with her, I'll make your life a thousand times worse than what it is now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's voice was cold with a unique magnetism, which was pleasant to hear but sounded like Satan to Zoe Stevens.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Zoe Stevens was pale with fear, but Sean, who was being warned, suddenly burst into laughter. "So Jason, you were nearby? But you didn't show up when I talked to Grace. Why didn't you show up? What are you worried about? Or rather... what are you afraid of?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes became colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Are you worried about Grace and I rekindling our romance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next moment, Jason grabbed Sean's collar so hard that he could hardly breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Rekindling your romance? Grace with you?" Jason sneered, his rage intensifying. "Sean, if you hadn't saved Grace's life, do you think you could stand in front of me and talk to me like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It became more difficult for Sean to breathe. He instinctively wanted to struggle, but it was no use.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just when he thought he was about to be strangled to death, Jason&rsquo;s grip loosened. He fell flat on his face, coughing and gasping for air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">For a moment there, he felt the terror of death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked down at Sean condescendingly. "You'd better not challenge my limits, Sean. It's easy for me to kill you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, he turned to leave, and the bodyguards took the memory card from Zoe Stevens's phone before following him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Zoe Stevens finally regained her freedom and limped over to Sean. "Brother, are you okay? How could Jason do that? How can he be so daring?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean laughed bitterly. "Why are you doubting him? Weren't you daring when the Stevens family hadn't fallen back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Zoe Stevens's expression changed as she bit her lip. "Are we just going to leave it at that? You... even injured your hand trying to save Grace..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"She&rsquo;s already paid for Mom's medical bills. Even though I saved her life, she has already paid me back. Don't ever say anything like that again and leave her alone." Sean got up and said to Zoe Stevens, "You can't afford to piss off Jason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But you pissed Jason off on purpose just now!" Zoe Stevens snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean's eyes dimmed. 'Yeah, I said those words in the spur of the moment and almost got strangled to death!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, one thing was certain... Jason was probably uneasy, and it was because of Grace. Otherwise, he would not have been irritated by what he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Who would have thought that a man like Jason would get uneasy for a woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">How much... did Jason love Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was something he might never be able to do!</p></div>
