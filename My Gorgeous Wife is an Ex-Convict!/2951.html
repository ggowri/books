        <h1>Chapter 2949</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda stared at the man in front of her, "You're really... shy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mhmm," he responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But...what are you shy about?" she asked dumbfoundedly. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone like him, who had been served by countless people since childhood, should not be shy about just taking off his clothes, right? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm afraid you'll think my body is not good-looking, afraid you won't like it, afraid you'll be disappointed..." He had never had such worries before, but now, in front of her, he had this kind of "fear". </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was stunned. Did he...even know what he was talking about? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With his figure, he could easily rival those international supermodels! Broad shoulders, narrow waist, and long legs - so many people envy him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people would just drool over this kind of figure, but he was actually afraid that she would think it's not good-looking? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are your standards for yourself...a bit too high?" Valda stammered, "Your figure is simply top-notch. How could I possibly think it's not good-looking?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really think it's good-looking?" he asked. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She nodded vigorously, "If your figure is not good-looking, then what am I? A third-class cripple? Look at you, you're lean and strong, with muscles, but not too exaggerated." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, her fingertips even directly poked and rubbed his chest and abdominal muscles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And your body proportions are great, with a beautiful neck and shoulder line," she said, her fingers tracing the areas she was complimenting. "Your body lines are very attractive, and with your head-to-body ratio, you're about 9 heads tall. Your legs are straight and your hips..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, her voice trailed off. Oh no, was she really discussing his body with him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anyway, your body...is very good," she summed up, blushing and lowering her head to continue hastily wiping him down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you like it?" His voice rang out above her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though shy, she was honest. "...Yes, I do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good, as long as you like it," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She couldn't help but look up at him again, seeing the soft smile on his face. It was as if her liking it was the greatest satisfaction to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at the smile on his lips, feeling a bit foolish...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally finished wiping him down, Valda hurried back to her own bedroom, washed up, and lay down on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she closed her eyes, all she could see was Brian's figure - the way he looked when she brushed past him, and the sensation of his body still lingered on her fingertips...and then she couldn't fall asleep no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Is she going to have insomnia tonight?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda thought to herself, and just then, someone gently pushed open the door to her bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a sudden shiver, she sat up and saw Brian walking in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you not sleeping?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yup... Yup, I haven't slept yet. How about you? Why did you come over?" Valda quickly tugged at her nightwear and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can't sleep," he said, "so I came over to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What? Look at her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda stared at Brian, and they both locked eyes in a staring contest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Time passes by quietly like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although his face is very handsome, it's not the same thing to keep looking at it like this in the middle of the night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda thought to herself and couldn't help but say, "Um...aren't you going back to your room?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You go ahead and sleep, I'll keep watching." He said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But the problem is, how can she sleep when he's looking at her like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if sensing her embarrassment, he said, "I'm just afraid that when I wake up tomorrow morning, you won't be in this villa anymore, so...I can't help but want to look at you. It makes me feel more at ease."</p></div>
