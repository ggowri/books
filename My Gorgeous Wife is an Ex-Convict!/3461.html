        <h1>Chapter 3459</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel never expected that on New Year's Day, his father would tell him something as shocking as a bolt from the blue right at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Embezzlement!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His father had embezzled 8 million yuan from the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a family like theirs, 8 million yuan was undoubtedly a huge sum of money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His mother was already crying uncontrollably, while his father kept blaming himself and apologizing to the family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Or... we could just sell our house. It should be worth several million yuan," Daniel said hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The house they lived in was the only valuable asset they had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what his father said next was like a bolt from the blue, making him feel like everything was turning black in front of his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've already secretly mortgaged the house to the bank and borrowed money!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, this house is currently unsellable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And if the bank's money is not paid back, the house will be repossessed by the bank!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, what's going on..." Daniel looked at his father, and for a moment, he didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was wrong, I fell into someone else's trap!" said old Mr. Cross, blaming himself. "I only mentioned to someone else that your girlfriend at school has some family relationship with the Reed family. Mr. Mason from the Reed family has been living with the Barlow family and calls your girlfriend 'sister'."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, he just wanted to show off. After all, with this connection, the leaders in the company would also look up to him when they heard about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he also tried his best to build good relationships with the leadership team, hoping to climb higher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At first, a leader took him to a banquet where he met some business people in tMason Swansonty. They organized a card game with small stakes, and he joined in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to winning money, he gradually became more relaxed and careless. The stakes in the game also became higher and higher. Eventually, when he came to his senses, he realized that the hole he had dug for himself was too deep to fill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was foolish and it's all my fault! But Daniel, they said that if your girlfriend is willing to ask the Reed family to do business with us, then I can clear the 8 million I embezzled from public funds and they will even give me an additional 3 million to pay off the bank loan." The elderly Mr. Cross looked at his son with hope in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Daniel paused, confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Reed family is now looking to develop a piece of land related to a real estate deal. They want to secure a portion of the furniture supply, and if they are willing to sign the contract, our family can be back to the way it was before," said the elderly Mr. Cross.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Daniel doesn't understand much about business, he can tell from what he's hearing that the other party has set up a trap. It's likely that the profit from this contract far exceeds the amount of money his father owes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, the Reed family has dedicated people to handle their business affairs. It's impossible for them to agree so easily," said Daniel.</p></div>
