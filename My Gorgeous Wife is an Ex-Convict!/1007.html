        <h1>Chapter 1006</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no control over where Brian wanted to go in Hart Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, when Brian followed Grace to the company's legal department, the department was shocked. The head of the department respectfully led the two into the conference room. He carefully took the papers from Grace and said with an awkward smile, "Thank you. Next time, you can just give us a call and we'll send someone over to pick the documents up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it was obvious this woman held a certain position in the crown prince&rsquo;s heart if she could make him accompany her here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even the head of the department was speculating whether the woman was the one the crown prince said he was in love with in the interview.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the interview was released, everyone in the company was shocked. Many people wondered who the woman the crown prince loved was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the crown prince changed girlfriends one after another, he had never used the word &lsquo;love&rsquo; on them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, many had privately discussed how a man like the crown prince would never fall in love with anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, who knew the crown prince would say such a thing in an interview.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Please check if these are the papers you need," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The head of the department flipped through the stack. "Yes, they're what we urgently need."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now that I've delivered these, I'm going to go now," said Grace before turning to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian suddenly grabbed her arm and asked, "Leaving so soon?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart, my business here is done," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But there's so much more I want to say to you," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The head of the legal department, who was standing nearby, promptly left the room and closed the door behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the man in front of her, feeling a little speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Jason came that day, so there&rsquo;s a lot I haven't told you yet. What would you like to drink?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. Just tell me whatever you want to say," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned slightly at her cold look. "Are you shutting me down because you still love Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't love him," she said in denial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Then why are you so cold to me? You know what? It's as if you're desperately trying to tell me not to fall in love with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at him in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Am I wrong? You're hoping I won't fall in love with you, right?" He bent down, his dark phoenix eyes looking straight into hers.</p></div>
