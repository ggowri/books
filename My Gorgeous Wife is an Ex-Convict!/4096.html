        <h1>Chapter 4094</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Have you fallen ill?" Tina asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if...I really am sick?" Chandler murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then of course we need to treat it!" Tina said matter-of-factly. "What kind of illness is it? Is it difficult to cure?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not particularly difficult, but without a specific medicine, it's hard to treat. However, if we find the specific medicine, it's easy to cure," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So...have you found the specific medicine?" she asked with wide eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at her for a while before saying, "Yes, I have."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he couldn't tell her directly that the medicine he found was the placenta of their future child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had to have a child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he told her this, how would she react?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was afraid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, afraid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were few things that could make him afraid, but this was one of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When you care more and more about someone, you become more afraid of losing them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's good then!" Tina breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, it's very late today. I'll have someone arrange for you to stay here for the night and send you back tomorrow morning. But tonight, you need to stay in the room and not wander around," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can't I stay here for a few more days?" Tina asked. She had taken a few days off from school for this trip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Be good and listen to me," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina pouted, feeling like he was still treating her like a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I'll just sleep in this room tonight!" she suggested as a compromise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After some thought, Chandler said, "Okay, you can stay here tonight. I'll sleep in another room."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Tina was surprised. She wanted to sleep in the same room as him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he went to another room, what was the point of her staying in this one?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you have to go to another room? Can't we just share one room? I promise I won't do anything to you tonight!" she said, suspecting that he was worried she might make a move on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hunter is conservative. Although we're engaged, we're still unmarried, so it's best to sleep in separate rooms. When we get married in the future, even if you want to sleep in separate rooms, I won't allow it," Chandler explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina blushed slightly at the thought of what they would be like after they got married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, Tina followed Chandler's advice and slept in another room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hunter's servants were clearly curious about her and couldn't help but stare at her when they saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night, Tina couldn't sleep in Hunter's guest room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I just can't fall asleep!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Being in an unfamiliar environment, especially this room which is far away from Chandler's room, makes it even harder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like Hunter purposely arranged for her to be so far away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Speaking of which, she came here because she listened to Weldon and wanted to see the real Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But after coming here, besides finding out that Chandler is sick but has medicine and it's not a big deal, there doesn't seem to be anything else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oh, wait!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina suddenly shuddered. Because so much has happened, she forgot to ask Chandler about what the servant said regarding a previous incident where a servant went in while he was taking a bath and came out with abnormal behavior.</p></div>
