        <h1>Chapter 1221</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like a question he was asking himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would never know how nervous he was when he asked her if she regretted it. He had been so nervous that he even felt his heartbeat and breathing stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace trembled, but his voice continued to ring in her ears. "Grace, you can't regret it this time. I won't give you a chance to regret it. From now on, you can only be my wife!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath, met his gaze with those almond-shaped eyes of hers, and said in an affirming voice, "I won't regret it!" Besides, she had no room for regret at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her bedroom was the same room as before. His bedroom was next door, and there was an adjoining door between the two bedrooms for easy access.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had mixed feelings as she looked at the familiar room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything in the room was the same as before. Even the clothes, the bottles, and jars she had not taken away were still there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"See if you have anything you want to move to my room. You can tell the maids to move them for you," said Jason. Seeing the flash of surprise on Grace's face, he moved his thin lips. "Do you think we'll still sleep in separate rooms when we're married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip a little. "I know we should sleep together if we're married, but I'm pregnant right now. Can I sleep alone in this room until the baby is born..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I don't want to?" he interrupted and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face immediately turned pale. "But the baby..." She just wanted to keep her hard-won baby and did not want to risk the slightest possibility of losing it. "Jason, you can do whatever you want after the baby is born, but can you at least let me sleep in this room alone while I'm pregnant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her pale face, a touch of reluctance rose in his heart. He always easily felt &lsquo;reluctant&rsquo; with her, but had she ever felt &lsquo;reluctant&rsquo; with him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly reached out his arms and held her in his embrace. Grace made a conscious attempt to resist, wanting to escape the embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He muttered, "Don't move. I just want to hold you like this for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He held her, and as if he was concerned about the baby in her belly, his hug was even a little cautious. "I'm not that inhumane. I won't do anything to you even if we sleep on the same bed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He just wanted to look at her. He just wanted to see her when he opened his eyes and smell her when he closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if that was the only way he could be sure that she had indeed married him and was staying by his side. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if her reason for staying with him was Lina or maybe the baby in her belly, he did not care.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He just wanted her to accompany him forever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... I sleep with the lights on," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what? Didn't I still sleep with you when you slept with the lights on last time?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was immediately rendered speechless. Well, it was true!</p></div>
