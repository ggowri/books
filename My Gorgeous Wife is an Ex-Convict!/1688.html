        <h1>Chapter 1686</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch suddenly rushed forward and said to Jasper Reed, "You didn't play that. You secretly played a recording, didn't you? You played the recording of others playing the piano and made it seem like you were playing it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That must be it! She had watched a TV show before that showed someone playing the recording of someone else&rsquo;s singing to make it seem as though they were singing it themselves!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That must be what Jasper did. How else could she play the piece?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy glanced at Oriel Lynch and coldly spat out one word. "Idiot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch's face went red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper once again took the boy's hand and said, "I want to hear you seriously play it. It'll be nice. We can even play a duet. It's boring to play the piano with Big Beard and the other adults. We're about the same age. It'll be fun to play the piano together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little boy's gaze returned to Jasper Reed's face. 'Play the piano... with her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch turned around awkwardly and rushed back into Irene Lynch's arms. "Mommy, let's go home. Let's go home! I don't want to stay here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was too embarrassed to stay here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch gently comforted her daughter and looked at Grace and Jason. Grace had walked over to Jasper and was saying something with her head lowered. Jason was holding Mick Reed's hand as he stood a few steps away with a smile on his lips. He was looking tenderly at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was jealous. How she wished the man's tender gaze was directed at her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she and her daughter were being bullied and ridiculed on the street back then, he had walked up to them as he held Mick Reed's hand, looking just like a god.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She thought she had met a hero who would rescue her, but as it turned out, her daughter was only a substitute for that little b*tch, Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now that the real deal had returned, her daughter no longer had a place in the Reed family. Others previously thought she might join the Reed family in the future, but now, they only ridiculed her by saying, "Your daughter's just an adopted daughter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Adopted daughter! Adopted daughter!' These two words seemed to be constantly getting on her nerves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even when she was live-streaming, haters would mock her about her daughter being adopted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch looked down at her daughter and said, "Didn't I tell you that I'm going to do a livestream and introduce some instruments today? I also signed a contract with the exhibition manager!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, the fun had not even started yet. How could she leave? She had done so much to prepare for what was to come!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Taking a look at the time, Irene Lynch calmed her daughter down and turned to say to the staff members following her, "Why don't we start here? It's about time to go live, and it's pretty lively here. We can just start."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, Miss Lynch." They began to take out their phones and set up the tripods.</p></div>
