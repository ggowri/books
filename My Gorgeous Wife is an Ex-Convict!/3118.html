        <h1>Chapter 3116</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little one's voice choked up as he said, "I knew it, you didn't die, and...this isn't a cartoon, how...how could you die so easily...they lied to me and said you might not be here anymore, but I didn't believe them. I'm not a kid, I can't be fooled so easily..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked down at the little person in her arms. Despite being a child, the little one kept insisting that they were not a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Simon, it's okay, don't cry!" Valda said softly. She didn't expect the little guy she had only known for a few days to be so worried about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't cry!" The little one vigorously wiped away the tears from his face on her clothes, then looked up and said, "You can't disappear for so many days like that in the future, you know!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little one had red eyes and looked like a little adult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda gently stroked the little one's head and said softly, "Okay, I know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little one looked at Valda's clothes, which were wet with his tears, and said a little embarrassedly, "Your clothes... I'll compensate you and buy you better clothes..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't have to worry about that, I'll buy her clothes," Brian said directly to Simon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Amber walked up and said, "Long time no see, Mr. Hart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It has been a long time," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber's gaze fell on Valda and she said, "You must be Valda. Kyla, Grace, and Simon have all mentioned you to me. Kyla said you had returned to Emerald City, and Simon has been pestering me to see you these days, so I brought him here. I hope we're not disturbing you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," Valda said, "I've been wanting to see Simon, and... I've actually been wanting to meet you too. I've only heard about you from them before, but I never had the chance to meet you. I didn't expect to have this opportunity now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber smiled and took the initiative to extend her intact hand, saying, "Hello, Valda, I'm Amber."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello," Valda also extended her hand and shook hands with Amber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them smiled at each other, and Valda had a feeling that she and Amber would also become good friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, let's go upstairs and into the room first. We can sit down and talk slowly if you have anything to say," said Brian. After all, Valda's current physical condition is not suitable for standing for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's go to my apartment first," said Valda, limping forward one step at a time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing this, Amber's eyes showed a hint of heaviness. She had heard from Kyla that Valda had a limp in one leg.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A person who was once physically healthy suddenly became disabled, and no one understands this feeling better than her. Her hand, which was once intact, is now missing a finger. Even though she has proven her innocence and that she is not mentally ill, but rather a victim of persecution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But that finger can never come back, and in daily life and work, it is inevitable to receive strange looks from others.</p></div>
