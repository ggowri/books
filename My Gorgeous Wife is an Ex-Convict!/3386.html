        <h1>Chapter 3384</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell remained silent and his expression became unpleasant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He always thought that if he was okay, then Harley should be okay too. But now, Chandler has told him that Harley will become a vegetable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Being a member of the Quentin family, he has been exposed to a lot of medical knowledge since childhood, so he certainly knows what a vegetable represents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where is she now?" asked Lornell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the ICU ward of the First Hospital," said Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell suddenly shifted his body, trying to get off the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler hurried forward and asked, "What are you trying to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to go to First Hospital," Lornell said. She wanted to see how the little one was doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're going?" Chandler was surprised. He had only come over hoping that Lornell could make a phone call to the old monsters of the Quentin family and see if any of them could come and help save Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But unexpectedly, Lornell volunteered to go to tMason Swansonty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhm," Lornell nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But your current condition..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm fine," Lornell said with unwavering determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After half an hour, Chandler brought Lornell to the entrance of tMason Swansonty hospital. Due to his injuries, Lornell was not fit to walk, so his men had arranged for a wheelchair to be brought. They pushed Lornell towards the ICU ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler accompanied him, occasionally glancing at Lornell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hunter had a relationship with the Quentin family for a long time. He had known Lornell since he was born and was familiar with his character.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell had never cared about other people's affairs, let alone Harley, with whom he had conflicts before. But now, he suddenly came to see Harley in person, even... when the doctor advised against walking and traveling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was going on between Lornell and Harley? Did something happen during the time they were together during the explosion? Chandler wondered in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, Chandler and Lornell arrived at the ICU ward in the pediatric department.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda and Brian were still in front of the ward, not leaving, but looking at their daughter lying inside through the glass wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For them now, every minute and second is a race against time, hoping their daughter can wake up soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Brian who first noticed Chandler's arrival, "Chandler, why are you here again, and with..." Brian's gaze shifted to Lornell sitting in the wheelchair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I told Lornell about Harley's situation, so he wanted to come and see for himself," Chandler explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Lornell's gaze was fixed on the small figure lying behind the glass wall on the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they were together in that terrible environment before, she would cry, shout, hum songs, and hold his hand tightly with hers. But why now, she could only lie there quietly, motionless, with a tube in her nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell watched quietly for a while, then suddenly said, "I... want to see her attending physician!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian and Valda were stunned for a moment. After all, it was strange for a 7-year-old child to make such a request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Chandler who seemed to have vaguely realized something, and immediately said to Brian and Valda, "Let Lornell see Harley's attending physician, it might be helpful."</p></div>
