        <h1>Chapter 2105</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did he agree to this?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then... I wish you all the best,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you. I hope everything goes well too," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was still immersed in the shock from earlier. She only came to her senses when Kyla waved her hand in front of her and called her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then... Then I must prepare a wedding gift." Lina realized she had spoken the wrong thing as soon as she said that. After all, Kyla and Martin Weiss were not marrying because of love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sure enough, Kyla said, "No thanks. This marriage is meant to be expedient."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, she glanced at Lina's belly again. "How are you these days? Does the baby kick as strongly as last time?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "No, but it's kinda unbelievable now that you mention it&hellip; Didn't my baby calm down when that little boy touched my belly last time? Then, the little boy said with absolute certainty that I'm carrying a girl."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Kyla knew about this too, so Grace asked, "What then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I went for my ultrasound check like usual the other day, so I asked the doctor to check whether the baby's a boy or a girl, and..." Lina's voice paused and she unconsciously lowered her volume. "It's really a girl. The doctor is also very sure that there&rsquo;s no way he misread it when I'm so far along in my pregnancy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Kyla looked at each other. Kyla said, "It's probably just a coincidence. The little boy probably just made it up. Or... someone in his family told him how to tell it's a boy or a girl from the shape of the baby bump. He thought you were carrying a daughter after looking at your baby bump and got it right.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, it seemed like it was all that was possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was not like that the little boy could predict the future or had x-ray vision where he could see whether she was carrying a boy or a girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But he sounded so sure, and the man behind him didn't seem to question him. It was as if it was... very common for him to do so," Lina said mysteriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "So? What do you think this little boy is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I suppose he has some special power? A superhuman or something," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace laughed and said, "You have quite an imagination. I remember you said that the little boy wants to marry your baby in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, if my future son-in-law turns out to be superhuman, will my future grandchildren have superpowers too..." Lina began to let her imagination run wild.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Aren't you afraid that your daughter won't like your future son-in-law? Then you won't have any grandchildren with superpowers." Grace quipped. Kyla had a rare smile on her lips too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If she doesn't like him, he can forget about marrying my daughter no matter what!" Lina said firmly but then also seemed to speak with some regret, "But that little boy is really good-looking. I wonder how stunning he'll look when he grows up. My daughter has nothing to lose if he becomes my son-in-law."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In conclusion, Lina was someone who valued beauty. She would sometimes be influenced by other people's good looks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The three of them talked and laughed as they began to discuss whether the little boy would become Lina's son-in-law in the future. For a moment, the atmosphere at the dining table lightened considerably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked at her two best friends in front of her. Every time she was with them, she would rejoice that she had such good friends.</p></div>
