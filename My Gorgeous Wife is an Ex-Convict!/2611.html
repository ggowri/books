        <h1>Chapter 2609</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&rsquo;re going to slowly limp into the house?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was instantly speechless. Her teeth bit her lower lip, and a faint blush rose on her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he was probably only carrying her because her walking slowly would annoy him or it was because of sympathy, she felt a long-lost sense of security as she lay in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss carried Kyla to the living room and placed her carefully on the couch before instructing the servants, "Go get the medical kit and get Nurse Ruan to treat Madam&rsquo;s injured ankle.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," a servant replied and hurried out of the living room to look for Shana Nicholls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other servants in the living room watched with some surprise in their eyes. The servant who had turned Kyla down when she asked for a medical kit now had a look of fear on their face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were deeply afraid that Kyla would tell Martin Weiss about it and they would lose their job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although they were only a servant in the Weiss family&rsquo;s house, their salary was higher than many white-collar workers out there. The job was not tiring either, and such a job was not easy to find.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls soon arrived in the living room, and the servant who had gone to fetch the medical kit came with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, why did you ask for me..." Shana Nicholls asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take a look at the madam&rsquo;s ankle. She sprained it," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls was surprised. It was the first time Martin Weiss addressed Kyla as the madam in front of everyone. The term &lsquo;madam&rsquo; was no doubt a deGracetion of Kyla's identity to the crowd so that they did not forget that this woman was the madam of the Weiss family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," said Shana Nicholls as she walked up to Kyla. She crouched down, lifted Kyla's pant leg, and began to examine her ankle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this posture made Shana Nicholls feel humiliated. Kyla sat on the couch like the high and mighty matriarch while she crouched on the floor like a mere concubine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To make matters worse, she was the one who caused the wound on Kyla's ankle. She had no idea if Kyla had told Mr. Weiss about the incident at the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls wondered nervously. Moments later, she got up and said, "There's nothing serious with the madam&rsquo;s ankle. It's just sprained and swollen. It'll recover after applying medicine for a few days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said as she took a jar of ointment from the medical kit. She was about to pass it to Kyla, but Martin Weiss snatched the jar from her hands first. Then, he crouched down in front of Kyla to apply it to her ankle himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't move." As Martin Weiss muttered, he took off her shoes and socks first. He held her foot with one hand and smeared her ankle with ointment with the other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cool ointment slowly seeped into her skin as he applied it, reducing the burning sensation she felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After he finished applying the ointment for her, he picked her up in his arms again before walking toward her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla could feel the servants watching them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they entered the room, he put her on the bed. Then, he left the ointment jar on the bedside table. &ldquo;Remember the instructions. Three times a day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he turned around to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait!" She stopped him. "Was that&hellip; intentional?" Did he intentionally carry her, who was having trouble moving, and apply the ointment for her in front of everyone?</p></div>
