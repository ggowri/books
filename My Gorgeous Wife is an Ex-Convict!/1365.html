        <h1>Chapter 1364</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The practice must not have been as easy as she made it out to be for her to draw like this. The effort she had to put in to do this was far more than ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s not worth much, but I want it to be a souvenir. It'll be a wonderful memory to wear it when we're older."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's already a wonderful memory for me now," he muttered as he bent over to kiss her tenderly. "Thank you, Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He owed all his happiness and wonderful memories to her presence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the only person in the world who could give him these!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a small hotel room, Paisley Daniels looked with some distaste at her ex-boyfriend who was smiling at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wondered why she had such bad taste and chose him to be her boyfriend back then. He could hardly compare to Martin. Fortunately, she had sobered up in time and dumped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if he had seen the disgust in her eyes, Shane Currey reminded her, "Hey, Paisley. You shouldn't think that you suffered when you were dating me back then. Let me tell you the truth. We&rsquo;re exactly the same kind of people, so you aren't any better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You were the one who took credit for Kyla Corbyn's bone marrow donation. You even begged me to file false records!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If it weren&rsquo;t for me, how would you have gotten together with Martin Weiss? You&rsquo;re fortunate enough that Martin Weiss doesn&rsquo;t hate you. You outright refused to donate your bone marrow back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me, aren't you supposed to thank me for helping you get together with Martin Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Shane Currey said made Paisley Daniels restrain the disgust in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, there was no need to mess with the person in front of her at such a time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Here... The 50 million you asked for is all on this card. The passcode is..." Paisley Daniels took out a bank card and handed it to him as she said the passcode.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shane Currey took the bank card. "Tsk tsk. Just like what I've said. You've been with Martin Weiss for so many years. The Daniels family must&rsquo;ve received lots of benefits, so you should have the money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels said with a cold face, "You already have the money. If you still say what you shouldn't say, everyone will suffer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, I know what to do." Shane Currey smiled. Then, he took a bottle of wine and said, "Here. How about a drink to celebrate? You're about to marry into the Weiss family and become the Weiss family's mistress while Kyla Corbyn will probably die soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels was unhappy at first, but her mood was lifted by the news that Kyla Corbyn was going to die soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she took the glass that was filled with red wine from Shane Currey and drank it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels drank down one mouthful after another, not noticing that Shane Currey was looking at her with lust in his eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On Sunday, after Kyla Corbyn dressed her son, she took her pills out of their original bottles and put them in a pill container so it was easier to carry around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When everything was ready, she took Nelson by the hand and said, "Alright, let's go down and wait for Daddy. Your daddy should be here in a minute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the clock, it was almost time for her outing with Martin Weiss today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was clearly happy and even brought along his new toy, a wooden spinning top. He said he wanted to show it to his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her happy son, a smile appeared on the corners of Kyla Corbyn's smile. She felt that all her sacrifices were worth it.</p></div>
