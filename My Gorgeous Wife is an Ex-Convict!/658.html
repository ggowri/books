        <h1>Chapter 657</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone saw Grace coming in and immediately said, "Hey, I used to think that Grace was the most promising person in your family. Who would have thought that the most promising one as a child is now the most down and out, and Stella is the most promising person in the Lu family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person was trying to flatter Stella Lindsay by belittling Grace, which was something Stella Lindsay liked to hear. After all, since they were young, they were always compared to each other because they looked alike and were so close in age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, Grace was the type of student who excelled in school and even got into a prestigious university, so Stella Lindsay was naturally embarrassed when compared to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Stella Lindsay would love to be able to hold her head high in front of Grace, but that was before knowing that Grace's boyfriend was Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that she knew Jason's true identity, Stella Lindsay only thought the relative who said that deserved a beating! She immediately looked embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if that was not enough, the person went on and said, "Maybe your grandmother's illness was triggered by Grace. How could she not be triggered by a family member who has been to prison? It's a good thing that you saved Master Hart when you were a child, Stella. He has been looking for you for so many years. You&rsquo;re going to live well from now on and need not worry for the rest of your life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay's face paled as she glanced at Grace with the corner of her eyes, fearing that this would remind her of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she met Jason's eyes instead. His dark eyes seemed to be mocking her and that made her heart flurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he knew she was just an impostor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, that's enough!" Stella Lindsay hurriedly stopped the relative and said, "What does Grandma's illness have to do with Grace? Saying that when Grandma's not even buried yet is just way out of line!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay then hurried over to Grace and comforted her by saying, "Don't mind them, Grace. They're just talking nonsense. We mustn't let it come between us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The relative who was scolded by Stella Lindsay looked dumbfounded. 'Did I rub her the wrong way? Isn't Stella Lindsay always saying that Grace is an ex-convict?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was in no mood to heed the jeers and did not want any conflicts to arise at the Lu family's house as that could ruin her grandmother's peace, so she simply said lightly, "I'll go stay with Grandma." As she spoke, she walked toward the room where her grandmother's body lay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason followed Grace and glanced at the relative who had been belittling Grace as he entered the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At once, the relative felt a chill rising up his spine and all his hair stood on its end like he was one step through the jaws of death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's going on here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why am I so frightened with that one glance of his?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All night long, Grace stood by the refrigerated coffin where her grandmother's body lay while Jason stood by Grace's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're sleepy, just lean on my shoulder and take a nap," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right, I can manage it," said Grace. Looking at her grandmother through the transparent coffin lid, she looked like she was sound asleep inside. "Indeed, people don't bring anything with them when they&rsquo;re born and the same goes for when they die. It feels like people live their whole lives, and sometimes they don't know what they&rsquo;re living for."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not necessarily. At least I know what I live for," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head to Jason only to see his thin lips opening and closing as he said, "I must be living to meet you and fall in love with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After falling in love with her, he felt that he was not alive to stay alive. He now had something he looked forward to and a hopeful future ahead of him.</p></div>
