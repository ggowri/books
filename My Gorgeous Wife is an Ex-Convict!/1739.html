        <h1>Chapter 1737</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was another price he had to pay so that Katherine Jackson would save Lina. He had no idea where Katherine Jackson got it, but she got an insect he had never seen before. It fed on Lina&rsquo;s blood and Katherine Jackson had him swallow the insect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, this is a blood curse. It's extremely sensitive to the smell of the owner's blood. From now on, the blood curse will cause your body excruciating pain once you have any physical contact with Lina. You can never be with her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson had told him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He thought he had no chance to be with Lina. He thought all he could do was punish those who had hurt her and make them pay the price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he later found out that the blood curse would not last forever. It was possible to get rid of it! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, things like blood curses had always been obscure. Few people knew about them, so it was naturally difficult to find someone to lift them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, he needed to set Katherine Jackson up so she would offer to get rid of the blood curse for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once the blood curse on him was lifted, he could stop suffering whenever he touched her and could truly be with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She would never know how painful it was when he was in the car with her that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Every hug and kiss had hurt him as if reminding him not to approach and touch her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he was willing to bear the pain... to be with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even if the pain was excruciating, he willingly endured it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It had hurt again earlier, but his heart kept telling him over and over that this was the last time it would hurt. Once he got rid of the blood curse, he would not feel this pain again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could hug her as much as he used to and... never leave her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina..." Hadwin Stephenson looked down at his still trembling hands. "I just want you to give me a little more time, just... a little more time..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As it was still early, Grace went to Reed group after site-surveying for her law firm in the afternoon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence was stunned to see Grace. "Young master Reed's... not in the office right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is he out for work? I'll wait for him in the office, then," said Grace as she walked toward Jason's office, not noticing Terrence's hesitant eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The empty office seemed spacious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace walked up to Jason's desk. She had only taken a casual glance but spotted a photo. 'This photo...' Grace pulled it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was a photo of a middle-aged foreign man in his 40s. Grace would not know who it was if it were an ordinary foreign man, but she knew him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was... Dr. Joseph! He was an internationally renowned expert on memory therapy and had treated many patients with amnesia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
