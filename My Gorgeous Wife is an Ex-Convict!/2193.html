        <h1>Chapter 2191</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper bit her lips as her wet almond-shaped eyes were fixed on him. "William... Will you... Will you come back with us?" She was discouraged as she spoke because he had a good life here. He had many people waiting on him, and he had his grandparents and father. It was a far cry from when he was at her home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He must prefer it here. He would not go back with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Back? Go back where? This is William's home!" Chelsea, William's grandmother, immediately spoke up as she was afraid that the little girl would take her baby grandson away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Charlie Barlow also said, "You must be Jasper. William was at your house for a while, but he has returned to his own home now, so he can't go back to Emerald City with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Jasper seemed not to hear them as her almond-shaped eyes were still looking straight at William. A moment later, she heard him say, "I'm sorry. I'm... not going back with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her eyes instantly turned red as she looked down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew he... would not go back with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... know you have grandparents and parents now, so you... won&rsquo;t go back with me. I know that... but... I'm still sad. I want to sleep and play the piano with you. And I want to tell you so many stories."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, come to think about it, she would have refused to leave her parents and brothers too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She understood it, but she still felt upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't cry. William has found his own home. You should be happy for him," said Grace as she cradled her daughter in her arms and wiped the tears from her daughter's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper pouted, but she was not happy at all. The thought of not being able to see William every day upset her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace turned her head and looked at William. "William, you were wronged when you were with the Reed family. I'm very sorry about that. I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William shook his head. "aunt Cummins, you don't have to apologize." He knew that aunt Cummins had been helping him look for evidence. Many people believed that he was a naughty child, but aunt Cummins was willing to ask him what had happened instead of believing right away that he did it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, it's very late now. Let's go home first," said Grace before taking her daughter's hand. Jason took their son's hand, and the four left the Barlow family's living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Jasper looked at William reluctantly before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked blankly at Jasper as she left. Then, he looked down at the chocolate, apology card, and... the doll he found in the storeroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I told you, how could our grandson have pushed someone down the stairs? Fortunately, the truth is out now. But they caused all this ruckus tonight just to apologize. I wonder how the Reed family educates their children!" mumbled Chelsea. She was about to hug her precious grandson when William suddenly ran outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hey, William, where are you going?" Chelsea immediately shouted and ran out. Charlie Barlow and several servants followed them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow stood in the same spot with a slight smile on his lips. He was not worried that his son would want to return to the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, William carried the blood of the Barlow family. Since he had something he wanted, he knew the price he needed to pay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William ran and caught up with the Reed family at the gate of the Barlow family&rsquo;s house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William called out, "Jasper, I... I don't blame you! I want to be your best friend, a better friend than anyone else. It's just that... I... I can't leave my present home."</p></div>
