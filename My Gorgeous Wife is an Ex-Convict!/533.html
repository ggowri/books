        <h1>Chapter 532</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't... It's too much." She was just a food delivery rider. If Emerald City's Young Master Reed helped her find a replacement for her day off, people would laugh their socks off if they heard about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only blame him for being so attractive that she got caught up in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Well, Grace finally understood that beauty distracted people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace! Grace?!" Kyla's voice rang in Grace's ear, and Grace snapped out of her trance. "Ah. What's wrong, Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I should be the one asking you what's wrong. You seem to be in a daze today. Is there something wrong?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah, no," said Grace, though she blushed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, how's Mrs. Corbyn's leg?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yesterday, Mrs. Corbyn fell and broke her leg, so Kyla closed the shop early and rushed Mrs. Corbyn to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not too serious. The doctor said she&rsquo;ll have a minor operation tomorrow," replied Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tomorrow? Isn't Nelson going to class tomorrow?" asked Grace. Children with cochlear implants needed to attend classes to learn how to better adapt to their cochlear implants and to understand what different pronunciations meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, attending classes helped Nelson learn to listen and speak more quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm afraid I won't be able to take Nelson to class tomorrow. After all, my mother's surgery requires family members to be present," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take Nelson to class tomorrow," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll take Nelson there?" Kyla was stunned for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, tomorrow afternoon happens to be my day off anyway. I'll take Nelson to class. Nelson's making great progress, and he seems to look forward to every class," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After every class, the little one would speak excitedly in front of her and pronounce some simple words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Being able to listen and speak opened a door for the little one to have an experience he never had before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to do that. Tomorrow afternoon is your day off," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Accompanying Nelson to class is also relaxing for me," Grace said with a smile. "It's settled. I'll take Nelson tomorrow afternoon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla heard this and no longer refused. "Thank you, Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On Saturday afternoon, Jason and Grace stood in front of the car. They were staring at each other while Grace was accompanied by Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you here?" Grace asked in surprise. She did not expect to see Jason's car waiting outside when she led Nelson out of the small restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I came to pick you up after work. Didn't you say you wanted to see a movie? It's your day off today," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly remembered that the celebrity she liked, Howell Webb, had a movie coming out. She had seen the trailer online earlier and mentioned she wanted to see it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unexpectedly, he kept that in mind and came to take her to the cinema this afternoon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wait a minute! Grace suddenly seemed to think of something, and her eyes widened. "It's&hellip; It&rsquo;s the movie premiere today."</p></div>
