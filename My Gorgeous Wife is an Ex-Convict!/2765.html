        <h1>Chapter 2763</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later on, the woman told so many jokes. He knew she was already thirsty but she continued only to see him laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly felt that having her as his girlfriend was a good thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller had seen Brian's smile before, but she always either saw a sarcastic or faint smile. Those smiles were never out of sincere joy. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his smile was different. It was genuine. Even if it was only a faint smile, it was penetrating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller thought about Brian's smile all night long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Valda Theller was busy working with her assistants in the studio. Suddenly, someone knocked on the studio door, and one of the assistants got up to answer the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller heard a familiar voice. "Where's Valda Theller? Where is she?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She got up and walked over to see her aunt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as the comer saw Valda Theller, she immediately came forward and said bossily, "I called you earlier. It's been days since I told you about it. What's the meaning of this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I remember I rejected you," said Valda Theller. She could not have made her point more clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You rejected? Do you know what's your last name? Your last name is Zhong. You belong to the Theller family. Your cousin is getting married and wants to buy a house. He wants to borrow some money from you. Why did you reject him? Where's your conscience? Have you forgotten who raised you when your parents died?" Valda Theller's aunt yelled at Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller only found her aunt to be ridiculous. She was trying to borrow money but made herself seem like a debt collector!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller turned to look at her two assistants and said, "Let's call it a day. You can go home first. I have some things to deal with here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, Valda. We'll go home first. Call us if anything happens," the two assistants said. They had worked in the studio for years, so they knew her aunt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every time she came, it would be about money. She was mean and snobbish. She was so arrogant to her niece as if she deserved to have Valda Theller give everything she wanted to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the two assistants left, Valda Theller said, "I lived off my parent's death insurance and their inheritance. Aunt, you took all 1.8 million dollars of their death insurance. I lived in your house from when I was eight to 18 years old. I lived in the university dorm after I was 18. Except for the tuition fees for my first year, I paid the rest of my tuition by taking part in the work-study program. Aunt, you can give me a bill. I'll see how much I've spent in the last ten years!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Great. You've grown up, so you're going to settle the accounts with me, aren't you?" Rowena Santiago snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "I'm just stating a fact. I didn't live off you. Besides, Uncle and my dad bought Grandpa's house together. But the house went straight to Uncle after my dad passed away. Half of it should be mine if we follow the inheritance law."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago instantly put on a fierce look and said, "What's the matter? Are you after the house now? I'm telling you, you have no right to get the house! Forget about it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller seemed used to her aunt's attitude. "Since you told me to forget about the house, I hope you'll forget about my money too. There's no way I'll borrow you money," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been foolish enough to think that they would regard her as their family if she were good to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She longed for a family because she had lost her parents. However, it turned out that doing this would make some people more aggressive. They treated her like an ATM.</p></div>
