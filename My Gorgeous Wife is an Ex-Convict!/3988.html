        <h1>Chapter 3986</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The car stopped in front of a villa, and Mick got out of the car and walked straight into the villa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy hesitated for a moment, then followed behind Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they entered the villa, the lights automatically turned on through motion sensors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a bright white light flooded the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick turned around and looked at Nancy, who was bowing her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She seemed even thinner than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her slender body and prominent collarbone made her look like she could collapse with a single gust of wind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, when he barged into his father's office, she was holding a dagger with her thin fingers and was about to cut off one of her own fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That scene was like a brand burned into his mind, unforgettable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I hadn't barged into my father's office, were you really going to cut off one of your fingers?" Mick asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Nancy replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think cutting off one finger can make up for what you owe me? " His voice became colder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just thought..." She didn't finish her sentence before he interrupted her. "Nancy, let me tell you, the debt between us is not so easily forgotten. What you owe me cannot be repaid with just one finger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For the first time in his life, he loved someone so deeply.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was also the first time he had been used and betrayed like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he was telling himself how absurd his feelings were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If one finger is not enough, you can tell me what else I can do to make you feel better," Nancy said. "I just want to try my best to ease your anger before I leave Emerald City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She would accept either one finger or one hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're leaving Emerald City?" Mick's expression suddenly changed as he stared at Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, since I promised you that I won't appear in front of you again, leaving Emerald City is the best solution," Nancy replied. "Also, I have already resigned from the hotel here, so even if you go to the hotel again, you won't see me. You... can rest assured."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick looked at the person in front of him coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She actually told him to rest assured!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the moment he heard her say she was leaving Emerald City, his heart suddenly tightened, as if it was being firmly grasped by an invisible hand, making him feel like he couldn't breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, who allowed you to leave Emerald City?" Mick approached her and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I continue to stay in Emerald City, maybe we will accidentally meet somewhere, and that will make you feel bad," Nancy said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pursed his thin lips, feeling overwhelmed with annoyance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you regret it?" he suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" She was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm asking if you regret using me. If you could do it all over again, would you still choose to use me?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She fell silent. If...if time could turn back, she might still make the same decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she couldn't think of any other way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only regretted not falling in love with him from the beginning and deceiving him by saying she liked him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had fallen in love with him from the beginning, she would have told him everything and asked him to help her seek justice.</span></p></div>
