        <h1>Chapter 1272</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave her the name of the hospital and said, "Why don't I come and pick you up now? I'm free anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A little later, Kyla Corbyn was slightly surprised when a black car appeared at the neighborhood gate she resided in. Bodyguards and drivers were following Grace. She looked at Grace in confusion. "This is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Jay arranged it. I'm married to him now, and I'm three months pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn widened her eyes and looked at her in surprise. "You're... married and pregnant? To Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace replied, "Yes. Come on, get in the car first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was still looking at Grace after getting into the car. It was as though she was still trying to digest the information she had just received. Who would have thought that so many things had happened after just a few days of not seeing each other!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, Kyla, your case will be heard in court in a month. Besides myself, I'll find you another lawyer who's good at such cases so you'll have a better chance of winning. However..." Grace hesitated a little. "I'm not entirely sure I can win the case, but I can probably keep public opinion under control and keep this case and Nelson out of the media."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was smart. She understood right away after Grace said so. "Are you going to ask Jason for help with my case?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled faintly. "It's nothing to Jay. I haven't mentioned it to him yet, but I think... he'll say yes." Even if... he wanted her to pay some sort of price, then... she would pay if she could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to repay Kyla and also protect Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said hesitantly, "Grace, I know you mean well, but&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No buts, so let's leave it at that," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you marry Jason of your own accord?" asked Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are various reasons, but I wasn&rsquo;t reluctant to do so. You know I've always been alone, and I've always wanted a home of my own. Now that I have a family, I'll have three lovely children soon. I really think it's nice." Grace had a gentle look on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was stunned. "Three?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I'm carrying triplets," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked shocked. She had given birth before, so she naturally knew how painful pregnancy was. She already found it difficult with one child, let alone three.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's going to be hard when your tummy gets bigger," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know. I'm mentally prepared for that," said Grace. Her hand gently pressed against her belly while her eyes were full of expectations for the little lives inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn thought about it. Since Grace had married Jason, he would certainly find the best doctors and hospital and make all the necessary preparations, so she was relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they arrived at the hospital, Grace took Kyla Corbyn to Lina's ward. Lina was still lying in the ICU ward. Kyla Corbyn could only look at the comatose Lina through the transparent glass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn only felt heavy-hearted when she saw Lina in such a state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stayed beside her. Looking at her best friend with thick gauze on her head, she secretly made up her mind that she would find out who hurt Lina!</p></div>
