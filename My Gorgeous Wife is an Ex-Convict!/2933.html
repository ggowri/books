        <h1>Chapter 2931</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland also spent a night in the hospital and only learned about what happened last night from her friend the next morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You mean to say that I was drugged and then passed out?" Camille Strickland exclaimed in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yesterday really scared me. I came back from the bathroom and couldn't find you. I called the police, but they didn't accept the case due to the short time. In the end, I had to go to Brian Hart to find you. Fortunately, he helped me find you. If it had been a little later, you might have..." Valda Theller recounted the scene from yesterday at the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland shuddered at the thought. Fortunately, Valda Theller came in time, otherwise she would have been in serious trouble!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, you said Brian Hart took a knife for you. How is he doing now?" Camille Strickland asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The doctor said it's not a big deal, but he needed eleven stitches and will need to stay in the hospital for a few more days for observation," Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was amazed. Eleven stitches, that's really a long wound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian Hart risked his life to take that knife for you. It seems like he cares about you more than you thought," Camille Strickland murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, in this day and age, how many people are willing to take a knife for someone else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side, in the VIP ward, Mr. and Madam Hart looked at their son lying on the hospital bed with grim faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You got injured and hospitalized, and you didn't even tell your family. If your father and I hadn't decided to look for you today, were you planning to keep it from us?" Madam Hart said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking that her son had been stabbed in the waist and abdomen and almost had to undergo surgery, she felt weak in the legs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They only had one son, and if something really happened to Brian Hart, it would be like the sky falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a minor injury," Brian Hart replied calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A minor injury? You needed eleven stitches for the wound. Is that a minor injury? What's a major injury then? Do you want me and your father to receive a death notice before it's considered a major injury?" Madam Hart shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The elegant and graceful lady was now losing her composure in the face of her son's injury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard that you were injured for Valda Theller?" Madam Hart changed the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart pursed his thin lips. Since his mother asked, it was obvious that she already knew what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing her son remain silent, Madam Hart continued, "You brought The Cross Family to the brink of bankruptcy for this woman, and you even took a knife for her. If you really think it's worth it, I won't say anything, but you've already broken up. What does this mean? What are you thinking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know exactly what I'm thinking," Brian Hart said. He just wanted to protect Valda Theller and didn't want anyone to hurt her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you know, then why..." Madam Hart was obviously getting angry again, and Mr. Hart quickly patted her shoulder gently. "Alright, Brian Hart has always been sensible and has his own ideas. Don't say anything more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, he has been sensible and hasn't caused us any trouble in other matters, but have we had less trouble in matters of the heart over the years?" Madam Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One Grace, and now there's Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She didn't know what her son would have to go through in matters of the heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, everything I did for Valda Theller was voluntary and what I wanted to do. She had nothing to do with it, and you shouldn't blame her," Brian Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Blame her?" Madam Hart raised her eyebrows. "Are you afraid that I'll go and scold her? You're injured and hospitalized. Where is she? Even if you've broken up, she should at least be by your bedside! Your injury was suffered for her. If this were ancient times, she should have offered herself to you..."</p></div>
