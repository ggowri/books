        <h1>Chapter 4290 Plan</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley smiled and said, "Mom, Dad, you two are lucky. At least you love each other. I envy you guys. Well, I'll go upstairs first! I've been in class all day today, so tired."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley pretended to be relaxed and went upstairs.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valda looked at her husband and suddenly asked, "Do you intend to cancel the engagement with the Quentin family?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all these years of marriage, they could already guess a little from each other's words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do have that intention if Harley is willing," Brian said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, everyone could see how much their daughter liked Lornell.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a pity that Lornell never had much affection for Harley, always showing indifference.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian once thought that Lornell, at such a young age, was willing to use an engagement to save Harley, which must mean he had some liking for her. But later he realized that Lornell was just curious about what it would feel like to have a fianc&eacute;e.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even so, Brian never regretted allowing the two children to make the engagement. After all, if they hadn't arranged the engagement, the Quentin family wouldn&rsquo;t have saved Harley. Maybe Harley would pass away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you suddenly think of breaking the engagement?" Valda asked curiously.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought it through. I should say it's because I saw Tina and Chandler get divorced," Brian replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Hunter family was also a member of the Crypt families. They saved the lives of Lina and Tina, and that was how the engagement was established. But in the end, Tina and Chandler ended up divorcing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because Tina lost her memory!" Valda said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But apparently, she doesn&rsquo;t love Chandler anymore. So even if Chandler still loves Tina, they will still be separated," Brian said. "And now, Lornell doesn't love Harley either. So in the future, they will separate inevitably. Instead of waiting to get married and then divorced, it's better to end this engagement early."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you know the rules of the Quentin family!" Valda said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, if you take something, you have to give something in return. The Quentin family saved Harley's life, so in the future, repaying the Quentin family with an equivalent favor would be enough," Brian said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But who repays a favor with a life?" Valda felt that her husband's words were equivalent to saying nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Quentin family has been looking for a medical book. And recently, I got some information about that book. Maybe if we find that medical book, it can be considered as repaying the Quentin family's favor," </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Valda pondered. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">If it's a medical book that even the Quentin family hasn't found, then it could indeed be considered a great favor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But will Harley be willing to do so? She has always liked Lornell so much."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wouldn&rsquo;t do it if that&rsquo;s not what she wants!" Brian said. "But she asked that question today, so I believe she must have such thoughts."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why you answered her that way?" Valda said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not exactly. Whether she wants to break the engagement or not, I would answer her that way. Love is between two people. Even if one person tries hard, it will ultimately be in vain," Brian said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not necessarily," Valda said. "Back then, wasn't it me who fell in love with you first, and then you gradually fell in love with me? Perhaps if we wait a little longer, Lornell will also fall in love with Harley."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what Lornell said, Brian's eyes filled with deep affection. "Thank you for not giving up on loving me back then!"</span></p></div>
