        <h1>Chapter 1633</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you want me to leave you alone so badly?" he asked with difficulty. The hands dangling by his sides were clenched into fists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was executing his plans early for her and risking it all, but the woman he loved the most was asking him to leave her alone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She retorted, "Shouldn't you? Since we had a clean breakup and steered clear of each other for five years, why are you suddenly pestering me? Do you think you can keep me out of the spotlight for a few days and everything will work out all right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson kept clenching his hands, and his nails stung his palms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why... Yeah, why?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because he missed her and longed for her. It was because he had devised a plan for five years. Everything would work out as long as she gave him a little more time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was why he could not help seeing her and getting involved with her. He knew his eagerness had almost ruined his plans again, but he was fortunately not the man he was five years ago!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Trust me, I'll go after everyone who has made a move against you and I won't let those people continue to berate you. If nothing good comes out of it in a few days, then..." He paused, and a bitter smile appeared on his lips. "I'll leave you alone from then on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because that would represent his failure!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina only felt a pang in her heart. His smile made her a little uncomfortable and breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, what exactly do you want?" She was confused. She could not figure out why he was doing this when they had already broken up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I want..." he murmured as he looked at her with longing and desire in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though his sentence was incomplete, she could guess what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's expression instantly changed. "No way! If you still have feelings for me, then don't bother. I won't get back together with you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Right in the middle of her speech, her phone rang, and the caller ID showed that it was Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as Lina was about to answer it, Hadwin Stephenson suddenly rushed over and grabbed her wrist. Her hand ached, and the phone fell to the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The phone continued to ring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His lips rested heavily on hers, cutting off the rest of her speech.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He used his other hand to firmly grab her jaw, not allowing her to struggle. He kissed her hard as though he was putting everything he had into this kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina struggled, wanting to turn her head away. She hit him with her other hand but his kiss kept deepening no matter how hard she struggled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His scent, warmth, and the feeling when he kissed her were so familiar. Lina's struggle gradually turned into a trance. She could hardly tell the difference between reality and illusion now.</p></div>
