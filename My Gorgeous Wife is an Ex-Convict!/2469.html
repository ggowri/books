        <h1>Chapter 2467</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had exhausted her love for him during those dark days...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell slowly opened her eyes, only to find that it was already dawn. The nurse was looking at her with concern. "Miss Mitchell, you're awake. Do you want me to help you to the washroom to wash up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, thank you," said Amber Mitchell. She sat up, only to find tears in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because she had dreamed of what happened that year, and it was too painful...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell went to the washroom. After washing up, the nurse came to change the dressing on her wounds. Once that was done, she ate breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything was different from when she was locked up in the mental hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was halfway through her breakfast when there was suddenly an argument outside the ward, followed by what seemed to be sounds of fighting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell frowned, wondering what had happened outside. Suddenly, the ward door was pushed open and someone barged in. The nurse in the ward tried to stop the person, but someone pinned her down the next moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When a figure came into the ward and appeared in Amber Mitchell's sight, her pupils constricted instantly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... George Gregory!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory was here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The men George Gregory brought had subdued the security guards outside, and George Gregory was slowly walking toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell stiffened as a chill shot up her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does George Gregory want?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was inconvenient to say some things when so many reporters were around earlier, so I wanted to come look for you at a quieter time," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His magnetic voice and gentle face were what she used to love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, looking at him now, she no longer felt any love for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know what's there for us to talk about, Mr. Gregory," Amber Mitchell replied hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory frowned a little. Her hoarse voice sounded so harsh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned to his men and instructed, "Wait outside the ward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," the men responded and led the nurse out of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hence, only Amber Mitchell and George Gregory were left in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory stared intently at Amber Mitchell. The white bandage on her forehead was so glaring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You were so infatuated with Herman Moss that you went to the Moss family's cemetery to pay him your respects at night. You were even willing to injure your head. If Herman Moss knows how infatuated you are with him now, he would think his death is worth it," George Gregory said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell instantly felt cold all over her body. 'He... knows what had happened last night? Does that also mean he has placed his people among the security guards at the cemetery?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Worth it?" Amber Mitchell found it ridiculous and felt sad. "George Gregory, so what if I'm infatuated with Herman? So what if I injured my head for him? I don&rsquo;t use these kinds of things to measure whether something is worth it or not. It's ridiculous that I used to think you understood me. You don't understand me at all."</p></div>
