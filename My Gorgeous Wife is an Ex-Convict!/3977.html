        <h1>Chapter 3975</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene's eyes were filled with malice. "Of course, I heard you say it with your own mouth. And, by the way, I was the one who gave the evidence to Mick. Otherwise, he wouldn't have known. You're such a scheming person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy widened her eyes in surprise. She never expected Irene to know about it before Mick did, and that Irene was the one who told him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why... did Irene know? And why did she say she heard it from Nancy's own mouth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, something flashed in Nancy's mind, which was previously muddled by alcohol. "Could it be... the teddy bear you gave me? Did you install a bug in it?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not that stupid after all!" Irene laughed. "But unfortunately, you have no evidence now. You can only blame yourself for not throwing away the teddy bear I gave you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why... would you do such a thing?" Nancy stared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no grudges against Irene, but from the moment Irene gave her the teddy bear, she knew that Irene had been plotting against her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" Irene sneered with jealousy. "Why can someone like you, who is useless, be liked by him? What makes you so special? I want him to see your true colors, so he'll know that I'm the one who truly loves him, and I'm the one who loves him the most!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Nancy was shocked to learn that Irene... loved Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, you're just someone who's been abandoned, so don't delude yourself anymore!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Irene left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy pressed her forehead with her hand, trying to endure the pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It hurt so much!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The effects of alcohol, combined with the chaotic facts she had just learned, made her headache worse and worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turns out that Irene was the one who caused Nancy to slow down that step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Irene hadn't told Mick the truth and instead spoke to him first, would the outcome have been different?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy walked forward, her thoughts racing and her steps unsteady.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, the outcome would probably still be the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because whether or not she slowed down that step, it doesn't change the fact that she used Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used him first, so it's only natural that he abandoned her, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Using the last of her clarity, Nancy asked her boss for time off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing her condition, her boss agreed to give her the time off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Nancy, can you make it home by yourself like this?" her boss asked, concerned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Nancy replied. "I'm just a little dizzy. I'll take a taxi straight home, so don't worry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy packed up her things and headed towards the hotel exit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as she walked down a hallway, she unexpectedly saw Irene and Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick's handsome face was still cold and distant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Irene, at this moment, was eager and no longer had the smug expression she had before Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother, can't we be like before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not your brother," Mick said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it was you who chose to let me into the Reed family and become your sister. It was you who made me fall in love with you. To me, you are not only my brother, but also the person I love the most. I haven't forgotten about you all these years!" Irene couldn't help but confess her feelings as she pulled on Mick's sleeve.</span></p></div>
