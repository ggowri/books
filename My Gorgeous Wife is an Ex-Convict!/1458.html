        <h1>Chapter 1457</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned. The Stevens family was not invited to the funeral today. It must have taken a lot of effort for Sean to come here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, Zoe came limping over and said angrily, "Grace, you wouldn't have been the mistress of the Reed family if my brother hadn't broken up with you. You&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Shut up!" Sean quickly stopped his sister, fearing she might say something inappropriate. "Hurry and apologize to Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean said to Grace, "Grace, I'm sorry. My sister doesn't know any better. Be the bigger person and don&rsquo;t bother quarreling with her. The Stevens family has wronged you so many times, and I can apologize however you want. I only beg you to let the Stevens family off!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's eyes flashed with confusion. She then recalled what Jason had done to the Atkinson family previously. 'In other words, Jay might be dealing with the Atkinson family and the Stevens family at the same time. Is that why Sean is putting on such a show now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I've been feeling guilty all these years, especially after I found out you were wronged. I felt sorry for you even more. If I had found out the truth for you, you wouldn't have suffered so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean looked remorseful and sad as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Grace just looked at him coldly. Sean's eyes were moist at the moment. Many women would feel sorry to see such a sad expression on Sean's handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, she remembered how he had stood beside Lily, coldly looking on as her fingernails were pulled out one by one. He had even ruthlessly stepped on the back of her blood-stained hand, saying the thing he regretted the most was dating her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">People would only find it hypocritical when a man like that showed remorse and sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her silence embarrassed Sean and made Zoe complain, "Grace, what do you mean by acting like this? My brother has already apologized to you. What more do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was suddenly amused by Zoe. 'Does this heiress think that the whole world revolves around her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said coldly, "Do I have to accept the apology just because he said he&rsquo;s sorry? If an apology can solve everything, how about I ask someone to break your other leg and then I'll apologize afterward?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Zoe looked at the bodyguards guarding Grace and was instantly terrified. She already had one broken leg. If her other leg broke too...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What... What do you want, then?" Zoe's voice trailed off noticeably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even your brother said that the Stevens family has done me wrong. Since they did me wrong, why should I be magnanimous and write off what had happened in the past?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Stevens siblings were stunned, not knowing what to say all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sean, you&rsquo;ve come to the wrong person. Since you did it back then, you must bear the consequences now!" said Grace. Then, she told the bodyguards beside her, "I don't want to see these two anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," the bodyguards replied and began to bring the Stevens siblings away by force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean looked as if he had been defeated, and his face appeared exhausted. The Grace in front of him was no longer the Grace he remembered!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he had relented and spoken with a nicer attitude back then, she would have yielded and given in to him even if they were in a dispute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she only looked at him with indifference and disgust now.</p></div>
