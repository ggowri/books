        <h1>Chapter 3469</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, this is how it is. You don't want me to fall in love with someone else, right?" Veronica's tears finally burst out uncontrollably at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she asked Daniel, she didn't cry, but when she asked Mason, she finally couldn't help but cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That is the person she trusts the most! They grew up together and have always relied on each other. She used to think that even if everyone else betrayed her, Mason never would!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But originally, nothing was taken for granted. The person she trusted the most, however, used this method to control her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, I just want you to be by my side and only like me," Mason murmured. "Why do you have to find someone else to be your boyfriend? I can be your boyfriend too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, you don't understand what family and love really mean!" Veronica looked at Mason with teary eyes and said, "You just don't want me to be taken away, you treat me like an object. This kind of emotion is not what I want! So, I will never let you be my boyfriend, never!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's face fell as he listened to Veronica's words. He had always thought that his love for her was true, but now he realized that he had been selfish and possessive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica wiped away her tears and continued, "I need someone who loves me for who I am, not someone who wants to control me. I hope you can understand that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason nodded silently, feeling regretful for his actions. He knew that he had a lot to learn about love and relationships.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica gave him a sad smile and said, "I hope we can still be friends, but I need some space right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason nodded again, knowing that he had to respect Veronica's wishes. He watched as she walked away, feeling a mix of sadness and relief. He knew that he had lost her as a girlfriend, but he hoped that he could still be a part of her life in some way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face turned paler and his body trembled, looking a bit unsteady. There was an obvious panic on her pretty face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, please don't say things in anger." He walked up to her and raised his hand to wipe away her tears. "I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as soon as his hand touched her cheek, she swatted it away. "Don't touch me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His hand froze in mid-air, and she stared at him with teary eyes, saying each word carefully, "Mason, I can never have those kinds of feelings for you, let alone fall in love with you. You can't manipulate my emotions like this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, she turned and ran away, and he instinctively tried to grab her hand but missed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if it was a sign that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't hold onto her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Daniel suddenly laughed, "Mason, it seems that fate is like this. Even if you scheme, Veronica will never like you, never! What's the point of making me break up with her? In the end, you're still empty-handed?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Mason seemed to not have heard him, staring blankly at his empty hand, his face full of despair!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel eventually transferred schools, and there was no longer any trace of him in the school. The discussions about Daniel and Veronica's breakup in both classes also became less and less.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica and Mason are still in the same class and sit together, but Veronica no longer talks to Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even when her classmates asked her about Mason, she would deliberately avoid the topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, did you have an argument with Mason?" asked a classmate who usually gets along well with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Argument? Veronica was momentarily dazed. Rather than calling it an argument, it was more accurate to say that she now understood more clearly than ever before that Mason was indeed the Reed family's Mr. Mason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All along, she thought of him as her "little brother" who needed her care. She believed that although he was cold and indifferent to people, he was more pure inside than anyone else, without being tainted by the filth of the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes she even worries that he is too pure and might be deceived by others in the future. She's afraid that he's too naive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, someone who thinks like this is truly too naive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There was no argument," she replied to her classmate, but didn't say anything else to the others.</p></div>
