        <h1>Chapter 4135</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Isn't this Mr. Hunter? What a coincidence to run into you here," came a voice as someone approached Chandler, warmly greeting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler glanced at the person. "It's Mr. Harrison, long time no see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Indeed. And who is this..." The person's gaze fell upon Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This is my fianc&eacute;e, Tina," Chandler introduced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Upon hearing this, the person's eyes scrutinized Tina with a hint of seriousness. In high society circles, although not many had seen Tina, they all knew about the union between the two families, and that it had been arranged for quite some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Therefore, as soon as Chandler mentioned Tina's name, the person knew exactly who she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was none other than the heiress of the White Maple Group!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hello, I'm Austin Harrison from Harrison Enterprises," the person introduced themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hello, Mr. Harrison," Tina smiled and followed Chandler's lead in addressing him as Mr. Harrison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Since we've bumped into each other, why don't we have a meal together? It'll be livelier," Austin suggested. "Mr. Hunter, today, Mr. Liu, Mr. Fang, and some people from the city are also here. It's been a while since we all had a meal together, so let's do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler was about to decline when suddenly Tina caught sight of a figure in the private room. "Kit?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina looked at the figure in surprise. She couldn't believe that Kit would be at this dinner hosted by Mr. Harrison. After all, Kit seemed to have no connection to this kind of gathering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh, Miss Stephenson knows Kit too? There are a few celebrities here tonight as well. Would Miss Stephenson be interested?" Mr. Harrison immediately asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina hesitated and said, "Um, I am a fan of Kit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Harrison exclaimed more enthusiastically, "Even better! Come on, let's go to the private room together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler glanced at Tina, his eyes gleaming slightly, "Let's have a meal together then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Harrison was delighted by the suggestion and immediately led Chandler and Tina into the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were quite a few big bosses in the private room who knew Chandler. When they saw Chandler, they were particularly friendly. After they learned about Tina's identity, they also showed some enthusiasm towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the private room, Tina indeed saw several celebrities whose names she could recognize, as well as some familiar popular anchors!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, these people were obviously just companions, here to liven up the dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit's expression froze when he saw Tina. He didn't expect to see her in such a situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Austin tried to liven up the atmosphere, "Come on, Miss. Stephenson is still a fan of our Kit. Kit should raise a toast to Miss. Stephenson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Others also echoed, so Kit picked up a glass of wine and said to Tina, "It is my honor to have a fan like Miss. Stephenson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After speaking, he drank up the glass of wine!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina also intended to have a drink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Drink less," Chandler said, after all, she couldn't handle alcohol well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I know, just one drink," Tina whispered, and Chandler didn't stop her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, Austin and a few other executives chatted with Chandler about some business matters. Tina wasn't interested in these matters and didn't join their conversation. Instead, a popular female anchor came over to her, clearly wanting to get closer to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina chatted with her absentmindedly, occasionally glancing in Kit's direction from the corner of her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Today, after seeing Kit, she felt that his complexion wasn't very good. She wondered if it was because he hadn't fully recovered from last night's incident in the elevator.</p></div>
