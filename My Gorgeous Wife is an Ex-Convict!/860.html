        <h1>Chapter 859</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't be a stranger, Kyla. If one day I'm in trouble, I think you'll help me too," Grace said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's true." Kyla also smiled. "By the way, I'm planning to move to G City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"G City?" Grace was surprised. This city was not far from Emerald City, but it was not near either. It was a three hours' drive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that city had beautiful landscapes. Although it was a tourist city, the cost of living was not high. It was about the same as the cost of living in third-tier cities in the country.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When are you moving?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Probably in September. I need to find a place over there and find a kindergarten for Nelson. With the hearing aid on, Nelson is just like an ordinary kid and has no problem communicating with others. So I want to find an ordinary kindergarten for him. I wonder if there's any kindergarten that will accept him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since her son was deaf, it was normal for him to go to special education kindergartens before this, but now that he was like an ordinary child, Kyla had the idea of doing so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted her son to grow up like an ordinary child instead of being classified as differently-abled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Deaf... She owed the boy for that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no matter how hard she tried, she could only let her son wear a hearing aid. It was impossible to get her son to hear like a normal person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll find one! Nelson is so smart and cute that everyone who meets him embraces him right off the bat. Doesn't he get along well with normal kids too? When Aunty took Nelson to the park nearby, Nelson could get along with the other children," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope so. I'll just look around for more kindergartens. There's got to be a kindergarten that would accept him!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Mrs. Corbyn arrived with Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Nelson saw Kyla, he immediately flew toward Kyla. However, before he reached her, he remembered that his grandmother had told him that his mother was injured, so he came to a sudden halt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grandma said you hurt your stomach. Does it hurt, Mommy?" The little fellow spoke clearly. His beautiful eyes looked at Kyla's stomach, full of worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His little hands seemed to want to touch Kyla, but he seemed afraid of hurting his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at her son. As Nelson grew older, his eyes seemed to become more and more like Martin Weiss's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was with Martin Weiss, the man had also looked at her with worry in his eyes while asking, "Kyla, does it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so sweet at that time that she even felt that it was a great blessing to find a man who loved her so much in her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she found out that this blessing was only the result of a scheme.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not hurting anymore." Kyla took the initiative to put her son's hands on her abdomen. "Although it's still wrapped in gauze, it's not that painful anymore. I can remove the gauze after some time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, the little one smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He heard from his grandmother that his mother was injured and wanted to go to the hospital to see his mother right away, but his grandmother would not let him. He could only video call his mother every afternoon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop getting hurt, Mommy. I want to see you every day," said the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled softly. "Alright. I'll try my best not to get hurt because I want to watch Nelson grow up by my side!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching the mother and son interaction, Grace turned to the little one to ask, "Nelson, aren't you gonna give me a hug?"</p></div>
