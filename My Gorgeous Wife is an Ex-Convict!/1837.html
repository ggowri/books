        <h1>Chapter 1835</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, I can go alone if you're busy with work," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He insisted and said, "I'll go with you. They're your mentor and your mentor's wife. Don't you always say how grateful you are to them? They've been good to you and Jasper. In that case, I'm also grateful to them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace leaned against Jason's chest and muttered, "Yes, they were very kind to me and Jasper. If it weren&rsquo;t for them, my life there would have been much harder. I almost ruined my mentor's reputation not long ago. I'm quite embarrassed about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't worry. I&rsquo;ll repay your mentor and his wife. I can give them anything they want," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"My mentor won't accept it. He's a man of the highest integrity. He has no other hobby than studying law. He cares the most about his wife. Her leg has always been my mentor's sore spot." With that said, Grace seemed to recall something and said, "By the way, I'll take my mentor's wife to see Dr. Russell and see if Dr. Russell can fix her leg."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What happened to her leg?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "I think she got into an accident and hurt her knee. From then on, she limps a little whenever she walks and can't walk long distances. It&rsquo;s also difficult for her to walk up and down the stairs. My mentor keeps saying that he caused the accident and feels terribly sorry for his wife. He has taken his wife to many renowned hospitals and specialists in the country over the years, but her leg isn't getting any better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"When they're here, take her to Dr. Russell. I&rsquo;ll find some specialists to examine her leg as well," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Three days later, Jason met Old Lawyer Watts and his wife when he accompanied Grace to the airport.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason recognized Old Lawyer Watts at a glance. After all, he had investigated everything Grace did in L City before. Hence, he received a lot of information about Old Lawyer Watts as well, but his wife... He remembered that there was a photo of her included in the information, but he had only glanced at it at the time and had no impression of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts did not look old. She was almost in her 60s but looked like she was just about to hit her 50s. Standing next to Old Lawyer Watts in a simple and elegant modified Tang suit, she looked much younger than her husband.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hello, I'm Jason. I've heard about you from Grace for a long time but haven't had the chance to meet you until now. Thank you for taking care of Grace," said Jason as he extended a polite handshake to Old Lawyer Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he reached out his hand to Mrs. Watts, she did not reach out her hand and just kept staring blankly at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason narrowed his eyes slightly. "What's the matter? Is there something wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh, n-nothing." Mrs. Watts turned pale and quickly reached out her hand to shake hands with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she let go as soon as she shook his hand. It was as if she was afraid of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For a moment, the atmosphere became a little strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mentor, Mrs. Watts, the car is parked outside. Let me take you there," said Grace as she quickly smoothed things over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay... Okay, let's get in the car first," said Old Lawyer Watts as he took his wife's hand and walked forward.</p></div>
