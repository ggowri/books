        <h1>Chapter 2830</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So I won't kiss you or do anything more intimate with you than holding hands and hugging from now on," Valda Theller seemingly said with determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned when he heard her say this, and a sudden discomfort overwhelmed him. "But didn't you say you're happy to do those?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm happy, but it's not fair to you. If it were me, I wouldn't enjoy someone I don't love treating me like that," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't mind..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I do!" She looked up and widened her eyes to meet his beautiful phoenix eyes. "When we&rsquo;re being intimate, I hope you&rsquo;re in love with me. People would want to be close to each other because they love each other, right? It&rsquo;ll become a burden if only one party is in love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared darkly at her as he pressed his thin lips. Her eyes were so clear that he was flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Do I really not hate her being intimate with me? Did I say yes only because we're a couple?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's up to you. If you think it's unnecessary, then we don't have to do those things," he said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not that it's unnecessary. I just want us to... uh... be intimate when you've fallen in love with me..." she said as she blushed, her eyes still clear. "Uh... Of course, I'll try to make you fall for me too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face seemed to fill with a fighting spirit. Those eyes were so bright that he had a hard time looking away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long pause, Brian said slowly, "Well... Valda Theller, make me fall in love with you as soon as possible."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked forward to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a heart-to-heart talk with Brian, Valda Theller relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dating was not all about deepening your intimacy with each other. It was probably better to let some things happen naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was attending the charity gala with Valda Theller, which was a relief to her. At least Valda Theller would not have to fear or worry too much if she made a fool of herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It felt like she had someone to protect her even if the sky fell, and Brian was her protector.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the day of the charity gala, Brian's driver sent Valda Theller to the salon for styling. Brian had prepared a gown for her beforehand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is the gown and jewelry Mr. Hart has prepared. He said you can change them to something you like if you're dissatisfied, Miss Theller," the staff member serving Valda Theller said respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at the gown, which was light blue, and the jewelry was a set of sapphire and diamond jewelry that matched well with the gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The gown and jewelry looked expensive. They were too expensive for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could not help biting her lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you dissatisfied, Miss Theller?" the staff member said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I'm satisfied," Valda Theller said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then please change into the gown first, Miss Theller. Then we'll give you a suitable makeup and hairdo," they said.</p></div>
