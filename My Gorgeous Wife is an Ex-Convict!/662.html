        <h1>Chapter 661</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These paintings showed images of her carrying him down the hill or snuggling with him in the woods.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, all they could rely on was each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the first time, he realized that she was so important that he might not be able to live without her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only one of these paintings was an exception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not a painting of a child, but the face of a grown woman. The woman in the painting smiled faintly. Her almond-shaped eyes were gentle and serene, but it made people feel comfortable. It was as if being stared at by such eyes would make you feel calm but also grounded at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stood in front of the painting, gazing at the person in the painting with his dark phoenix eyes. Pain flashed in his always indifferent and distant eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Grace was here, she would discover that she was the person in the painting!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why aren't you her?" his cold voice rang in the studio, but there was no reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman in the painting only looked at him with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his hand and gently stroked the face in the painting as if he was stroking the woman's cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If only... Grace was the one standing in front of him now. She would not let his hand touch her face like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw her in a wedding dress today, he realized that she and Jason were really getting married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would be the wife of another man. From now on, she would only have that man in her heart, and she would bear children for that man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be impossible between him and her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Impossible!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the word flashed through his mind, he had a feeling of near suffocation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, Brian left the studio. He said to his servant, "Put away all the paintings in the studio. Also, lock the door. No one is allowed to enter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," the servant answered and did what he instructed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his eyes and looked out the window at the full moon. Since he had misplaced his feelings, he was simply getting rid of them now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This should be a simple matter to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Grace was not the one he was looking for. He had only put that longing and despair on her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I mistakenly fell in love with her because her features bear traits of the little girl from my childhood!' Brian told himself...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the three days that her grandmother's body was at the Lu family's house, many people came to pay their respects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, only a small number of them came sincerely for Mrs. Lu. Most of them wanted to take this opportunity to get close to Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay certainly enjoyed that feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Grace and Jason, Jason once said in front of First Uncle and the rest that he did not want to be disturbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, no one dared to reveal Jason's identity. In everyone's eyes, Jason was just Grace's boyfriend.</p></div>
