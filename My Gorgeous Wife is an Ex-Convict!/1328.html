        <h1>Chapter 1327</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Yes, I'm happy. Our marriage is far happier than I thought it would be. Sometimes, I'm a little worried because I'm so happy right now. Especially after comparing myself with Kyla and Lina, I&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" he interrupted her abruptly and said with great certainty, "No matter what happens, we'll be together forever!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gaze was intense and domineering, catching her firmly like a net.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was willing to be caught in his net. "Yes, we'll be together forever!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was after three in the morning. Kyla Corbyn dragged her tired body back to the rental house. She took out several boxes of medicine, filled a glass of water, and took her pills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were seven or eight of these pills altogether. These used to be the last thing she wanted to take, but now, they gave her hope to live another day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Mrs. Corbyn came out of the bedroom, her eyes could not help turning red when she saw her daughter taking the medicine. "I think you should stop running the food stall. We still have some savings. Or I can work as a domestic helper so you can spend more time with Nelson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn swallowed the last two pills and turned to look at her mother. "Mom, you're too old to be a domestic helper. I'll run the food stall for another month and make some more money. After all, we need to spend a lot on medicine every month. I'll close my stall in a month and spend time with Nelson then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn felt sadder as she looked at her daughter's calm appearance. "Did the hospital really check it right? Did they&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've been to two hospitals. The test results are the same. How could they be wrong?" said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you ask Grace for help? Hasn&rsquo;t she married Jason? Jason is so influential in Emerald City. Maybe he can find a good doctor to treat you? There's hope!" Mrs. Corbyn said unrelentingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn shook her head. "I owe Grace enough already. She's pregnant, and I don't want her to worry about me. What's more, my sickness is already in the intermediate late stage. I've seen the specialists in both hospitals. They all said there's no other way but to replace the liver. But Mom, you know I have a unique blood type. Most livers won&rsquo;t be a match for me, and it's almost impossible to find a liver with the same blood type as mine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She chose to hand Nelson to Martin Weiss because she had already been sentenced to death and could do nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn could not help but cry. "Why did you get your father's blood type? If only you got mine. An old woman like me is of no use. If only I could give you my liver."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's nose felt sore too. She wiped her mother's tears with a tissue. "Mom, I&rsquo;ve let you down the most. I was supposed to take good care of you, but you were constantly on the move with me and never enjoyed life. Mom, you need to take good care of yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's nothing to apologize for between us mother and daughter. I just hope you can live longer and spend more time with me!" said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn tried to squeeze out a smile and said, "I will. After I hand Nelson to Martin Weiss in three months, I'll accompany you back to your hometown, Mom. I'll find a nursing home for you there. With the money I&rsquo;ll be leaving you from my insurance, it should be enough to pay for the nursing home&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn rambled on. She had planned it all out for Mrs. Corbyn, but the more her daughter spoke, the more Mrs. Corbyn felt sad.</p></div>
