        <h1>Chapter 623</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've mistaken me for someone else, Mr. Hart. Besides, even if you didn't mistake me for someone else, it makes no difference. The person I love is Jason, and he's also the person I want to marry. I won't have any feelings for you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words made his blood freeze instantly. His whole body stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the opportunity to pull her arm out from between his fingers. "I hope you won't come to me for this again in the future. It doesn't make any difference whether I'm her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Grace turned to look at Kyla and said, "I'm going to go home, Kyla."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," answered Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had walked out of the small restaurant, but Brian still stood there while staring blankly at his empty hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Empty, empty!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It doesn't make any difference whether she's her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is that? Why?' Brian slowly gathered his hands and held them tightly, letting his fingernails prick deeply into his palms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at Brian with some shock on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expression on the entertainment industry's crown prince's face was so sad that he seemed to be enveloped in hopeless loneliness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like he had lost his most important treasure. He seemed to be mourning!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know what? I've always felt as if I'm dispensable. Even if one day I don't exist in this world, it wouldn't matter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... At least I don't think you're dispensable. I... Probably wouldn't have gotten away without you, so you're very important&hellip; Very important to me... I can think of you as someone important to me from now on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're the first person besides Mom to say I'm important. How nice. If only we could be together forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, I can be with you forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who is it? Who&rsquo;s saying these words?' Why did it seem as if there were layers of mist enveloping her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she could see were two tiny figures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who the hell is it?' She tried to make out the two figures, but the more she tried, the more her head seemed to ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" With a cry of surprise, Grace sprang out of bed and sat up. What she saw was darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, a voice by her side rang. "What's the matter? Did you have a nightmare?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, the lights in the room were switched on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head, a little shocked. She looked at the bright, amorous eyes of the person beside her. His gaze was now filled with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's Jay!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You look so pale. Did you have a bad dream?" His fingers slowly went up to her cheek, and the familiar temperature made her feel a little more comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," she replied as she shook her head. 'At least it wasn't a nightmare, just&hellip;' She lowered her eyes slightly as a strange feeling came over her.</p></div>
