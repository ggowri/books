        <h1>Chapter 692</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Something happened when I was buying the books in the bookstore. Then, I met Brian," Grace said without hiding anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she did not want someone else to tell him and cause him to misunderstand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes rested on her face. "Then what?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"People were filming me with their phones and there were a lot of people looking on. Brian helped me by taking me away in his car. He stopped the car a few hundred meters away from the bookstore, and I got out to meet Lina."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gave a rough account of what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I don't want you to misunderstand anything. It just so happened that Brian passed by today," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she felt differently about Brian, it was only because her strange dreams had made her wonder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyelashes quivered a little, then he stretched out his arms to embrace her. "I won't misunderstand anything because I know I'm the one you love most, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mmm," she replied softly, leaning against his chest and feeling his cool body temperature. "Jason, you're the only one I love. There's no one else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hands that were wrapped around her tightened slightly. "Grace, you mustn't fall in love with anyone else. I won't stand it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can it be?" Grace smiled, lifted her chin, stood on tiptoes, and took the initiative to kiss him. "Do you think there&rsquo;s anyone in the world who loves me more than you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I'm the one who loves you the most!" he answered, grabbing the back of her head with one hand and kissing her back hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His kiss almost took her breath away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Um... Jay... That... That's enough..." She turned away almost in a fluster to take a breath, but the next moment, his lips kissed hers again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, not enough... It's not enough..." he murmured, kissing her more deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not seem to kiss her enough. He wanted to own all of her, to brand her with his breath and his mark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason picked Grace up horizontally, his bright peach blossom eyes full of lust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. 'No way. He's not going to&hellip;' "It's not evening yet." She blushed as she gasped, her chest heaving. She did not know her bashful look was more likely to provoke desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lay her gently on the bed, trying hard to resist the urge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would probably frighten her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea how badly he wanted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what?" he asked with his breath fragrant like an orchid as he lowered his head. His lips came close to her ear as he breathed softly. His fingers tugged her hair before slipping down to her collar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face immediately turned redder. She knew what he was trying to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes, eyebrows, and the expression on his face seemed so full of temptation now that she could not take her eyes away from his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, say you want me," he said, his voice cold and hoarse with emotion. "All I have is you. Say you want me, all right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt as if she was sinking into his eyes. His voice... 'How could I not want him?'</p></div>
