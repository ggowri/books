        <h1>Chapter 253</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"For fear of it becoming a habit," Grace said, somewhat embarrassed. "Some things may become a habit after many times. When you&rsquo;re no longer able to rely on that, they become despair instead.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, were you desperate before?" he asked casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath, looked into his eyes, and finally stopped hiding. "Yes, I was desperate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His pupils froze slightly. The faint smile on his face also slowly faded away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you go out now? I want to change," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason did not back off. His dark eyes were still staring at her, and his fingers were stroking her cheek as if he was thinking of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment, he muttered, "Will you be afraid if I say that it has already become a habit and that it&rsquo;ll never change?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at the face close to her, not knowing what to say for a moment. She felt as if her heart was violently beating right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the dressing room, Grace blushed and changed her clothes. Although Jason had gone out, she felt as though her face could still feel the touch of his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, she had not replied to his question. If it had become a habit, it would always be so... What did he mean? Would he stand up for her all his life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man like him would never bother to lie, so he must be thinking the same thing as he was saying it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what about later? Who would know? He had never been one for her to speculate on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It was better not to have any&hellip; habits.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said to herself in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stood by the door of the dressing room. His eyes were drooping low as if he was thinking about something, and his bodyguards stood behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the bodyguard shivered as he looked to the left. He only saw a figure coming this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, the bodyguard also recognized the man. It was Brian, the crown prince of the entertainment industry and a friend of Young Master Reed. Therefore, the bodyguard did not move but just stood in the same spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian walked up to Jason and said, "Did you come here today to stand up for her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason slowly lifted his head and looked at the person in front of him, smirking. "So what if I did? What a coincidence to see you here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Coincidence? Brian smiled faintly. Knowing that Jason was here today, he guessed that Grace would be here too. That was why he had hurried over to see what would happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, he saw a good show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he did not say it, Jason had probably guessed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't care if you happen to be here by coincidence or on purpose, but 'she'&mdash;you can't touch. 'She' is mine," Jason said lazily. He looked indifferent, but there was some kind of seriousness in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you care that much about this woman?" Brian asked blandly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I do." He confessed matter-of-factly, surprising Jason's bodyguard. Young Master Reed just said that he cared about a woman. He... had never heard Young Master Reed say that before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Young Master Reed had never said he &lsquo;cared&rsquo; about Jennifer Atkinson, Young Master Reed's previous fianc&eacute;e.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had a slight surprise in his eyes. After years of knowing each other, he knew how hard it was to get the word &lsquo;care&rsquo; out of Jason's mouth.</p></div>
