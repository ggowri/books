        <h1>Chapter 1378</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides... Martin had never wanted her all these years. The only time was three months ago when Martin got very drunk and she deliberately threw herself into his arms. However, all Martin said after getting drunk was Kyla Corbyn's name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she did spend the night in his bed, he had not touched her that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she tricked Martin into having sex with her now, she would not be able to hide the pregnancy duration from anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to her own child, she cared more about getting the position of the mistress of the Weiss family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then abort the baby. Do it in secret before you marry into the Weiss family. Then you can find an excuse to rest for a few days. Everything will be fine," said Mr. Daniels after thinking about it for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels mused, 'I'll abort this baby, but... I'm going to come up with something. I want to use the baby in my belly to make Martin end his feelings for Kyla Corbyn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom and Dad, I have an idea..." With a smile on the corners of her lips, Paisley Daniels whispered to her parents about the plan she had just come up with...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her best friend who was trying to eat in the hospital bed. After Hadwin Stephenson left Lina's ward that day, they had thought Lina would be so sad it would trigger her illness. Grace had even told Jay to inform the doctor to bring Lina straight to the operating room the second anything happened to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when they walked into the ward, Lina just smiled at them and said, "I'm... a little... sleepy. I want to go to bed..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Lina really did fall asleep!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina woke up the next day, she was still positive about the matter regarding her illness, but the more her best friend behaved this way, the more uneasy Grace felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong... Why are you looking at me like that?" asked Lina. Although she was still stammering a little these two days, it was much better than a few days ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated a little but still asked, "Are you sure you're okay?" They were alone in the ward now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina swallowed her food and said to Grace, "How can I&hellip; be okay? My... feelings for him are real. He and I would&rsquo;ve gotten married... if this hadn't happened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then why aren&rsquo;t you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina interjected, "Why am I... not crying? Actually... the night he came, I... cried alone when my dad was asleep."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She had no idea about such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina made a whispering gesture. "Don't tell... my dad. He slept so soundly at night that he didn't notice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina exhaled and said, "Grace, I don't want to think about... anything else now. I just want to get well and live for the people who love me and care about me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Hadwin Stephenson, perhaps they were not suitable for each other. He had always wanted to climb to the pinnacle of power and wealth and be the best, while she just wanted to lead a peaceful life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help in his journey to realizing his ambitions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In that case, they might as well break up.</p></div>
