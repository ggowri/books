        <h1>Chapter 4178 Tina's Choice</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina felt a sense of unease rising within her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before she could speak, a loud explosion erupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately after, a second explosion followed...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three-story building began to collapse in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In just a moment, many people were trapped beneath the rubble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina and Eugenia were also trapped beneath the rubble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina smelled the scent of blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her body was filled with intense pain, making it hard for her to determine where exactly it hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Eugenia... are you... are you okay?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... I'm still alive!" Eugenia trembled and said, "Tina, we won't die here, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as they were rescued, they suddenly encountered this situation again, causing Eugenia's spirit to almost collapse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, we won't die, we will be saved," Tina said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice slightly reassured Eugenia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then, suddenly, an even louder explosion occurred, and shouts from outside could be heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh God, it's the dam, the dam has been blown up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "How could this happen? The water from the dam will come rushing down!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Quick, quick, save them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina's heart skipped a beat. Was the dam blown up? Was it Mr. Perkins who did this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So, Mr. Perkins meant it when he said they would all go down together!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It seems that Mr. Perkins had planned for every possibility!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The rocks that were pressing down on her and Eugenia were moved aside, but at the same time, the rushing water surged towards them in an instant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Ah!" Tina and Eugenia were both swept into the raging current almost at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> A SWAT officer managed to grab hold of Eugenia, while Tina held onto Eugenia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The three of them were like a chain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, in the waves of rushing water, it was extremely difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina saw that the SWAT officer holding onto Eugenia was about to give in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, the chances of survival were too low while dragging two people in the water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia cried out, "Tina, hold on, don't let go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But if Eugenia didn't let go, then the three of them might all die in the water!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina mustered her last bit of strength and said to Eugenia, "Eugenia, I'm sorry... for involving you. Please tell my parents that it was my fortune to be their daughter. I hope in my next life, I can still be their child. And... tell Chandler I'm sorry, I couldn't become his wife..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I won't tell, I won't tell! Don't let go!" Eugenia shouted desperately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina smiled weakly; she knew Eugenia was kind-hearted, so she would eventually tell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Slowly, Tina released her grip, and all she could hear was Eugenia's screams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But this was the best choice she could make right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Three people dying or one person dying, no matter how you thought about it, it was more cost-effective for one person to die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She just felt sorry for her parents' nurturing kindness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And... sorry, Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had promised Chandler so solemnly that she would save him! She would give birth to their child and save him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina!" a hoarse voice suddenly resounded, carrying a sense of fear that made one's heart tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina's body was swept away by the surging waves, heading towards the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She struggled to open her eyes and looked towards the sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She saw a figure desperately running towards her, trying to jump into the current.</p></div>
