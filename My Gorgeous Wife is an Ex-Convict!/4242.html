        <h1>Chapter 4240 Rejection</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Tina said this, both Edmond and Kit were shocked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit, in particular, never expected Tina to say such words.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rely on? Would the Stephenson family be his support?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had deceived her so much, the Stephenson family would probably hate him very much, so how could they become his support?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmond awkwardly withdrew his hand and forced a smile: "Since Miss. Stephenson cares about our Kit like this, then I naturally have no objections. I have something to do today, so I'll leave now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Edmond left on his own.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the apartment, only Tina and Kit were left.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit greedily looked at Tina. He had thought that he would never see her again, but he didn't expect her to appear in front of him like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like an illusion!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit unconsciously reached out his hand towards Tina's face, wanting to touch her, wanting to confirm if she was real or if all of this was just his delusion!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as his hand was about to touch her, she suddenly stepped back, instantly sobering him up like a bucket of cold water.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit slowly lowered his hand and looked at Tina with bitterness: "Miss. Stephenson, hello."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This "Miss. Stephenson" made Tina feel a difficult-to-describe discomfort in her heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her memory, Kit used to call her "Tina." During their time in the small town, they were so close. She regarded him as her only family, her only love, her only support in this world.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the end, what destroyed all her feelings for him was his lies.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I happened to be at the door just now, and since the door wasn't closed, I came in," Tina said, somewhat uneasily biting her lip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit immediately explained, "I must have forgotten to close the door properly."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Tina's gaze fell on Kit's right hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that his hand was disabled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if noticing where her gaze was, he said lightly, "It's just an inconvenience with one hand, but it doesn't pose a big problem in life. The doctor said that as long as I rehabilitate properly, I can still regain some function."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you facing financial difficulties now?" Tina took a deep breath and asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit smiled bitterly, "Don't worry, I've been working for several years and have some savings. Life isn't difficult for me right now. I won't take up my father's proposal!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, all he had left was just a bit of dignity.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did your father treat you like this before?" Tina hesitated and asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, he only saw me as a tool. I spent time in the orphanage until I was 8. If he didn't think I looked decent and could be cultivated, maybe I would still be in the orphanage now," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Silence filled the air.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit continued, "I know what you said to my father about the Stephenson family being my support was just to help me. I won't take it seriously, so Miss. Stephenson can rest assured."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few seconds of silence, Tina said, "What I said to your father wasn't a joke. You lied to me, which is despicable, but you also saved me twice, once in the village and once during the car accident, so..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I refuse," Kit interrupted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at him with a surprised expression.</span></p></div>
