        <h1>Chapter 2106</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was another person... who had helped her. They had helped her in that prison full of pain, but she had no idea when she could repay them for their kindness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's heart sank at the thought. After all, she did not even have the person's contact information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, the hope of finding them had only gotten slimmer after so many years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla and Martin Weiss arrived at tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau a few days later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked blankly at the signs hanging in front of the entrance of tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau. She had once hoped that Martin Weiss would propose to her and they could come to this place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, she was imprisoned and she stopped thinking about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She never expected she would ever set foot here to get married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Now, she came here to marry Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you not going to go in?" Martin Weiss's voice rang beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm going in," Kyla replied after taking a deep breath. However, her footsteps were so heavy that each step seemed to weigh more than a tonne.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They entered tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau, got their queue number, and sat in the waiting area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Marriage and divorce were both handled in tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Not long after Kyla sat down, a woman seated next to her started a conversation with her. "Are you here for a divorce too?" she whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze slightly before looking at the people there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">People who were here to get married were talking and laughing, while those who were here to divorce were ignoring each other while looking indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She and Martin Weiss looked just like they were here to get a divorce!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before Kyla could say anything, the woman beside her said, "I'm here to get a divorce too. I thought I hit the jackpot before we got married. Then I realized he's trash after we got married. I took care of the kids, did the chores, and looked after his parents. He acted like he was doing charity every time he gave me some allowance. I've had enough of getting beaten up whenever something went wrong outside!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The woman seemed to have many complaints about her marriage, so she poured her heart out to Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla listened politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a while, the woman seemed to have finished speaking. She looked at Martin Weiss. "But your husband is so good-looking. Why do you want a divorce? He didn't have an affair, did he? Nowadays, the more attractive the man, the less trustworthy he is. If you ever get married again after the divorce, find someone honest. Don't just look for the good-looking ones..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We're not getting a divorce; we&rsquo;re getting married." Martin Weiss's voice rang out of the blue, then his eyes glanced coldly at the woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The woman immediately looked embarrassed as she said to Kyla, "Oh, why didn't you tell me sooner that you're here to get married? You don&rsquo;t look like you&rsquo;re here to get married. You&rsquo;re both sitting here with such long faces and not saying anything!"</p></div>
