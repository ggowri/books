        <h1>Chapter 2824</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The air became silent, and the hand that was holding her chin earlier let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Will he think I'm...' Valda Theller thought to herself but dared not open her eyes to see how he would react when he heard her statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, you're avoiding me because you want to be more intimate with me?" Brian's voice rang after a long while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his voice was not as indifferent as usual but hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"... Yes,&rdquo; she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was speechless. He even asked her why. It was because... "I like you, so... so I want to be more intimate with you, of course. I overthink easily when I see your body. When you get close to me, I'll blush, and my heart will race. I... I don't want to do this either, but I can't help overthinking sometimes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, she added, "Why don't... you stay away from me? I'll go back to my bedroom and calm myself down. Maybe I'll stop overthinking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In other words, you won't have feelings for me anymore when you've calmed down?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course not!" she quickly said in denial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't mind you liking me," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze and instantly opened her eyes to see Brian's handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... don't mind it?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He replied nonchalantly, "Why should I? You said you like me, and that&rsquo;s why you'll overthink. Since we're a couple, what's there to mind?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip. He showed no expression of disgust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It... It&rsquo;s great that you don't mind, but I'd better stay in my room alone for a while before I do something bad to you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had worries about her determination if the man she liked were to prance around her in a bathrobe. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter even if you do it," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes widened slightly, still in a trance. "What... What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only thought her round eyes were now so wide that they looked adorable. "If you really want to force yourself on me, you can. You can also kiss and touch me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was dumbfounded. Brian's words were like a violent shock wave, causing her mind to go blank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, she finally came back to her senses. "You're willing to do that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'm willing," he said. He was willing because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took several deep breaths and stammered, "Do you love me? Do you love me... even a little bit?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes glimmered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word &lsquo;love&rsquo; was too heavy for him, and he had given almost all his love to a woman named Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since then, he seemed to have lost the ability to love anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, I don't know if I love you a little bit because I&rsquo;ve never known the definition of 'a little bit'. And I have never loved anyone 'a little bit'." His love for Grace had never been little. It had kept growing over the years.</p></div>
