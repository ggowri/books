        <h1>Chapter 2729</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Naturally, they looked at her with surprise after finding out she was a comic artist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if they did not expect the crown prince of the entertainment industry to have a regular comic artist as his girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, there was some commotion at the banquet hall's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned his head to look and froze. Valda Theller, who was holding his arm, was the first to notice something was wrong with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked up to see two figures walking into the banquet hall. Many people walked toward them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those two were... Jason and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller had met Grace in the shopping mall before, while Jason... Valda Theller found his photo online afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'They're here, and Brian...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She subconsciously looked up to Brian and saw him looking straight at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked over as if sensing something. Then, Grace also looked over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instantly, the four people looked at each other from afar under such circumstances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, let's go say hello." Moments later, Brian's voice rang in her ears. However, his voice sounded slightly tense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Tense?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze. 'Brian tenses up too?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could feel that the arm she was holding had stiffened since Grace appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He... must be really nervous.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Biting her lip slightly, Valda Theller's hand slipped from Brian's arm to his hand. Then she opened her fingers to grab his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He paused, turned his head slightly, and looked at her as if he was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said sternly, "Brian, I'm your girlfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That sentence seemed to make Brian's nervousness fade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was unbelievable. She thought she was the one who would scared or nervous, yet she was the one motivating him now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, you're my girlfriend," he muttered before lifting his feet again and leading her to Grace and Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What a coincidence running into you here," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's quite a coincidence," said Jason as he sized up Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is my girlfriend, Valda Theller." Brian introduced before saying to Valda Theller, "This is Jason, the president of Reed group. The one next to him is his wife, Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, Mr. Reed," Valda Theller said naturally before looking at Grace. "Hello, Mrs. Reed. We met once. I didn't expect to meet you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah." Grace nodded. "You can call me Grace. I'll call you Valda." Grace liked Valda Theller.</p></div>
