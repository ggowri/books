        <h1>Chapter 3021</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he hasn't fallen in love with her yet, it would make her happier to spend her life with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And, she had a feeling that he would definitely fall in love with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, she waited and waited, until one day he would say to her, "Valda, I love you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought, that would be the most wonderful sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian hugged Valda tightly, "Okay, if you get pregnant, we'll get married. If you don't get pregnant, then whenever you want to get married, I'll marry you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay!" Valda raised her hands and hugged Brian back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Marriage...at this moment, she began to look forward to what their life would be like after marriage, and what their children would be like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be a very happy life, wouldn't it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because of William's relationship, Philip stayed in Emerald City for a few more days after the banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During these days, William kept going to the Reed family, so Philip naturally visited the Reed family every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When are you leaving?" Jason asked Philip, his guest, clearly wanting to give him the hint to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In a few days," Philip replied. "And what about you? Are you really coming to Deer Capital in two weeks for the piano competition that Jasper is participating in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since the competition is in Deer Capital, we naturally have to go," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about your wife and the other kids?" Philip asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mick, Jasmine, and Grace will come with us," Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shall I prepare rooms for you all?" Philip offered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason felt a bit helpless. Although they stayed in a hotel during their previous trip to Deer Capital, Jasper always liked to visit the Barlow family, and even insisted on sleeping with William at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, going to Deer Capital, they would probably encounter this situation again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In order to keep his daughter under his watchful eye, Jason finally said, "That would be great, but there will be a few more people in my family this time, so we'll need two nannies to take care of Jasmine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No problem," Philip readily agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Speaking of which, does Jasper's room still need to be prepared separately? It seems like every time she comes to the Barlow family, she sleeps on William's side," Philip casually mentioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Preparation is still necessary." Jason said with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. "The child has grown up and ultimately there are differences between boys and girls. It's not good for them to continue sleeping together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't mind if the two children sleep together. After all, they are still young. Even if they sleep together, it's just a way for them to feel close to each other," said Philip leisurely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I mind!" Jason said directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This is the difference between the boy's father and the girl's father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip smiled and didn't continue talking about the topic. Instead, he said, "When you come to Deer Capital, let me show you some hospitality as a landlord. I also hope that Jasper will achieve good results in the competition this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where is your son? Is he not participating in this piano competition?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't participate," said Philip. "For him, the piano is just a tool." William only plays it to win Jasper's favor, because she likes it when he plays. So, William will continue to play.</p></div>
