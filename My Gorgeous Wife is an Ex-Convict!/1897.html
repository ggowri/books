        <h1>Chapter 1895</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her heartbeat was like a beating drum. Her clothes were a mess while he was fully dressed. She should be the one feeling embarrassed, but he was the one even more embarrassed instead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason turned his head and looked away from Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At this moment, he just wanted to calm down and not let himself get flustered by her and love her more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">These days, he had been telling himself over and over again to stop being a loser and stop loving someone so much. The more he loved someone, the more he would be hurt when they betrayed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace slowly got out of bed and came to Jason. Her hands gently cupped his face again. "Jay, will you look at me?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Rather than being shy, she wanted him to see her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes fell indifferently on her. "So what if I look at you?" However, his clenched hands by his sides gave him away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does she know how much willpower I need to subdue this desire?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, we're husband and wife, so let's work out any problem or conflict, okay? I don't want us not to see each other or give each other the silent treatment. It&rsquo;ll drive us further and further apart. You're the one I love the most. I want to spend my life with you." Grace stood on her tiptoes and kissed him as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His lips were cold when she carefully kissed them. Each kiss seemed like a test as she was afraid that he would push her away or reject her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he did not. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He just stood quietly and let her kiss his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he did not give any response at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The kiss seemed one-sided.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a while, she breathlessly finished the kiss, trying to press her body against him to prove how much she loved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, I love you..." Her lips were close to his ear, and she repeated these words over and over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He gently looked down. His eyes were full of struggle, but she did not notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wanted to prove that she loved him, and he wanted to prove that he did not love her that much. He wanted to force her to leave by humiliating her. If she still did not want to leave, he would prove that he could slowly withdraw his feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even if she was the only woman he had loved in his life, he could love her less and it would not hurt so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason slowly closed his eyes and allowed her kisses to fall on him. Memories that he had forgotten and then recovered flashed through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her whisper rang in his ears. "Jay, you love me and have feelings for me, don't you? I promise I won't hurt you again. Whether you want to sue Mrs. Watts for what happened back then or get justice for your dad, I won't intervene again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Yes, he had feelings for her. No matter how much he restrained himself, his restraint was always so weak when facing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His physical reactions could not fool anyone! How pathetic and ridiculous!</p></div>
