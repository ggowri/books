        <h1>Chapter 267</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Here, sit down first," Tony Cummins said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sat down and asked directly, "Where are you going to move Mom&rsquo;s grave to?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no hurry," Tony Cummins said and waved. "Let's talk about you and your sister first. I'm going to be a peacemaker for you two today. No matter what has happened before, you're still sisters. As an older sister, you must take care of your younger sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned slightly. "I just want to know where you&rsquo;re going to move my mother&rsquo;s grave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins was upset. "Didn't I already say that we'll talk about this later? Let's talk about you and your sister first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis, if I&rsquo;ve done something wrong, don't take it to heart. I apologize." Evelyn looked sincere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace was defensive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more Evelyn was acting like this, the more problematic it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, what Tony Cummins said next also made Grace understand what Evelyn's purpose was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, you'll always be sisters. You can't hurt each other over a man," Tony Cummins said to his eldest daughter. "Brian is your sister's boyfriend, Grace. You can't mess with your sister's relationship. Besides, aren't you close with Jason now? Then you shouldn't get between your sister and Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly realized what this was all about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not interested in what's going on between her and Brian. I just want to know where you&rsquo;ll be moving my mother&rsquo;s grave." Grace repeated her question once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins fumed. "Are you refusing? Do you really want to get between Evelyn and Brian? I'm telling you, if you ruin Evelyn's relationship, don't think about paying respects to your mother's grave for the rest of your life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared coldly at her father. "It's not up to me to refuse or not. If Brian really likes her, no one can take him away from her. If Brian isn't serious about her, she won't be able to keep him no matter how hard she tries!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean?" Melinda Riley was anxious. "Are you cursing our Evelyn because you won't be able to marry Jason? Our Evelyn is not like you. She's innocent and has no criminal record. She's going to be the best actress someday, not like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you think she is different from me, let her conquer Brian on her own," Grace said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not quite understand why Brian chose Evelyn as his girlfriend in the first place. Was it really out of love? It seemed not. If it was, he would not have let Evelyn kneel on the set in front of so many people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though it was Jason's idea, but with Brian's background, he did not have to fear Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Grace had seen how Brian treated his ex-girlfriends. Maybe sentimental people were actually the cruelest. She did not think Evelyn would really be Brian's last girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I only came here today on account of the relocation of my mother's grave! You can give me the grave relocation documents and the household register. I will move my mother's grave myself," Grace said. As a matter of fact, her household register had not been removed from the family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if she did move out, she did not know where to put her household register. She did not have any real estate in Emerald City, and she could not put herself under the Sanitation Service Center's collective household register. As for her grandmother's&hellip; Her first uncle and the rest would probably think that she was trying to split the relocation money and would not agree at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Grace felt so isolated because she did not even have a place to stay.</p></div>
