        <h1>Chapter 1160</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was trying to prove that the woman in front of him could not influence him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn only felt a trace of bitterness in her mouth. Even though she had already gotten over the man and no longer had any feelings for him, she could not stop the bitterness from spreading when she heard him say this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If... I say I didn't push Paisley Daniels down the stairs, and Paisley Daniels did it all on purpose, you... still won't believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn spoke in a tone that was verging on a humble plea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was begging this man to trust her and not define her as a criminal. She did not care whether she was a &lsquo;criminal&rsquo;. After all, whether she was a criminal could not reverse her time in prison!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not want the &lsquo;criminal&rsquo; identity to bring any harm to Nelson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss seemed to have heard a joke. "Believe you? You want me to believe you? Kyla Corbyn, don't you think it's funny to say that now? Paisley lost a child because of you and even became infertile for life. What right do you have to raise my son?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I never did any of these things!" Kyla Corbyn looked straight at him. "What you see is not necessarily true. Sometimes, your eyes may deceive you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you're telling me that everything I saw that day isn't true? My testimony is false too?" he said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed her lips tightly. She had explained to him again and again, but he did not believe her. He did not even have a trace of pity for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was only humiliating herself by telling him this. He still would not believe her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been branded as the daughter of his enemy from the very beginning. How could he believe her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've never harmed anyone, and I've never taken a human life. Just because Paisley Daniels fell down the stairs on purpose, does that mean I committed the crime? Martin Weiss, I pleaded guilty not because I admitted to the charge, but because of your testimony!" she said. She had never done anyone any harm, but she kept getting hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was hurt by him, Paisley Daniels, and the prejudices of the world!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she had survived the worst of it, but he still wanted to hurt her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's expression immediately changed. Her accusation stung him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He put down the teacup in his hand, stood up slowly, and walked to Kyla Corbyn. "Since you say you didn't commit a crime and what I see is not necessarily true, okay, I'll believe that what I saw is not necessarily the truth as long as you destroy your eyes today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn stared at Martin Weiss with her eyes wide open, almost in disbelief. However, her disbelief turned into self-mockery and understanding after a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, why should I be surprised? This is the man who put me in prison with his own hands, so what if he wants my eyes?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If... If I destroy my eyes, you'll believe that I didn't harm Paisley Daniels, let Nelson stay with me, and not fight me for him?" Kyla Corbyn asked in a murmur.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss only felt the stinging feeling getting stronger. "Yes, I'll believe you and won't fight you for Nelson. So? Are you going to destroy your eyes?" he said, full of sarcasm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was only saying these in front of him for show. In that case, he wanted to see how far she could go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn lowered her head and closed her eyes gently. She remembered how he had said he loved her eyes the most.</p></div>
