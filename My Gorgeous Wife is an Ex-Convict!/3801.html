        <h1>Chapter 3799</h1>
        <div><span>.</span><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had already been hypnotized and had forgotten that part of his emotions, the memory seemed to be even more vivid in his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you called me here today just to talk about this matter, then I can tell you clearly that my decision will not change," Mason said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Snap! Snap!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica cried until tears fell from her cheeks and onto her hands, only then did she suddenly realize that she was crying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because his voice was so resolute, as if there was no room for any hesitation, that all the arguments she had thought of for days were stuck in her throat, and she </span><span>seemed unable to say a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her tearful face with some hesitation, and his heart was once again stabbed with pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stop hurting! Since they were going to break up completely, then stop hurting! He kept telling himself in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her tears were still flowing, and his heart was still hurting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason turned his head away, trying hard not to look at her tears. "Even if you cry, it won't change the fact that we're breaking up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I didn't know that we could break up so quickly. I thought this time, we could be together for a long time, but...it turns out that being with me makes you feel so tired..." She choked, "Do you know? When I heard that you were hypnotized, I was very panicked and afraid that everything between us would be meaningless to you. Later...it really became meaningless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She laughed at herself, but her tears fell even more fiercely. "I have regretted it all these years, regretted misunderstanding you in the end and making you choose hypnosis. So when you said you were willing to 'try' with me, I was so happy and grateful, feeling that God had given me another chance to be with the person I love the most."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said, step by step, approaching him, "Mason, I...I really thank God for bringing you to my side, for giving me the opportunity to protect you, for letting me accompany you for so many years. It's just that...you loved me too early, and I loved you too late. You said you were tired and didn't want to continue dating me, then...what about your feelings for me? Do you really not love me anymore?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to know how much he still loved her at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raising her hand, she wanted to touch his face, but at the moment her fingers touched his cheek, he suddenly stood up and took two steps back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he was rejecting her touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt her last bit of hope shatter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you really don't love me anymore, do you?" Despite her heart sinking, she still wanted to hear the answer from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally turned his face, his expressionless face looking at her with cold eyes, as if he was empty of everything.</span></p></div>
