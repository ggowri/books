        <h1>Chapter 1075</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her eyes gently and looked quietly at the purple gown in her hands. She went on with her mending without a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The faint smile on the corner of his lips gradually disappeared. "Stop," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she seemed not to hear and just went on with what she was doing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes darkened, and the jealousy within him grew stronger. It was as if all she could see was the gown... Or rather, all she could see was Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I told you to stop!" He snapped, and the next moment, he yanked the purple gown out of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Grace gave a low cry. The needle in her hand had stabbed into the index finger of her other hand. A flush of red blood instantly gushed out from the spot where she had been stabbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had pricked herself hard, so the blood was flowing fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a few moments, a great deal of blood was gushing from her slender finger, and the red blood dripped down her fingertip to the dark floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing what was happening, Jason threw away the gown and squatted down before taking Grace's hand in his. He put her bleeding finger into his mouth and sucked the blood from her fingertip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze, feeling nothing but warmth and dampness on her fingertip. The waves of heat enveloped her fingers and made them hotter and hotter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared blankly at the man who was in front of her with some astonishment. He was kneeling before her with his eyes lowered. His eyes were half concealed by the long and thick fan-like lashes, and there was obvious worry on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was worried about her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, his thin lips slowly parted. He looked at the finger he had just sucked. The blood was no longer gushing out like earlier but was still oozing a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it hurt?" he asked as he looked up at her. His long black lashes were lifted as he looked up. Those dark, glittering eyes looked so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly came back to her senses. "I'm fine." With that, she was going to withdraw her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not let go of her hand. "Don't move, or the blood will gush out again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a prick. It's nothing," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It may not mean much to you, but to me&hellip;" His words disappeared in his mouth and he did not go on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sight of her bleeding was like a stab in his heart. He even felt a sense of regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He caused her this wound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lowered his head and looked at her fingertips. "Don't worry about the gown anymore, alright? Since it's torn, let it be. Don't mend it. Don't make me angry, alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He spoke and pressed her fingertips to his lips, gently sucking the blood off her fingertips little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could feel the burn on her fingertip, but her heart seemed to be sinking.</p></div>
