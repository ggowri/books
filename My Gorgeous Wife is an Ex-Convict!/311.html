        <h1>Chapter 310</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get in." His thin lips spat out these two words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A hint of struggle suddenly appeared on Lina's face. Her phone was precious, but the price of her freedom was higher! She did not want to be locked up in his room for hours as she had been yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Grace had not come with Jason to take her away yesterday, she did not know when she would be able to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. I was just thinking about changing my phone. I don't need that old phone anymore," Lina said timidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't need all those photos and all those internet accounts on your phone anymore? By the way, I think there's also some of your company's internal information on it," Hadwin said lightly. "If you don't want it, so be it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was&hellip; a threat!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina gritted her teeth, but the problem was her phone was password protected. Did... Did he unlock her phone and saw the photos and information on it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, her various social media accounts... Could he have decrypted them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could you?!" she said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to get in or not?" he asked without answering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt like something was stuck in her throat. She could not swallow nor spit it out. She found him to be a sweet cutie when she first met him. How did he turn out like this after years of not seeing each other?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lina could only hang her head low as she opened the door of the passenger seat and sat down beside Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she got into the car, she saw Hadwin playing with her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My phone!" she exclaimed, subconsciously trying to get her phone back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before her hand could touch the phone, he grabbed her by the hand. "You seem to have had a good life these years," he said thoughtfully. With his other hand, he tapped on the photo album on her phone, which showed all kinds of photos of her smiling. Some of them were travel photos, while some of them were everyday photos. Others were photos of her eating delicious food outside. Looking at the photos as they were, her life seemed pretty well off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the problem was everyone would take photos of their happy times. Who would take photos when they were sad?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not too bad I guess..." Lina answered timidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She twisted her wrist, trying to pull it out from his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It felt strange to be held in his hand like that. It was as if all his warmth was passing through his fingers to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she had gone crazy for his pretty fingers. She even had the cheek to tell him, "You've got pretty fingers, let me feel them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What happened after that? He seemed to have given her his hand and let her touch wherever she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As someone with a &lsquo;hand fetish&rsquo;, the feeling of his hand... Uh, it was nice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wait, what was she thinking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina suddenly came to her senses and wanted to slap herself. Look at what she got herself into, yet she was still busy thinking of fingers and whatnots!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she looked up, she once again looked into Hadwin's beautiful black eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his eyes, which were looking at her, seemed to be clouded with feelings she could not understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, he let go of her hand. Lina's hand was finally free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How are you going to get me to return your phone?" Hadwin asked coldly.</p></div>
