        <h1>Chapter 875</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lowered his head and began to eat. After a few bites, he looked up at her and said, "It's delicious, Sis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her expression changed. "I'm not your sis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" He smiled. "Isn't it good to be my sister? I can make you the most honorable woman in Emerald City. You can have anything you want in Emerald City. No matter how expensive it is, I can get it for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I want you to stop appearing in front of me?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes gradually darkened. "Are you that against seeing me?" Even his voice turned cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." She met his eyes and gave him a sure answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only by not seeing him could she really forget him and their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face darkened, and tension began to fill the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just when Grace thought Jason might leave in a rage, he suddenly smiled again. "I really want to see you, though. What should I do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She choked. She simply could not rebuke him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, dig in. I don't want to argue with you when I can finally eat with you. I remember you used to like eating with me. Even if I got home late, you insisted on waiting for me to eat with you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Jason as he lowered his head to eat again. She felt as if something was stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had liked the feeling of having dinner with him because it felt like she was having her meal with a family member.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now&hellip; Dining together seems ironic.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her head and picked up her chopsticks to eat. She had cooked the vegetables as usual, but she felt like she was chewing on wax.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neither of them spoke again and there was an eerie stillness in the rental house except for the sounds of eating and chewing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, when they were finished, Grace looked at Jason. She said, "Alright, we've finished eating, so can you go now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about you? Have you decided? Do you want to be my sister?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at him coldly. "Jason, do you want a woman who dated you to be your sister? Don't you think it's disgusting?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Disgusting?" He suddenly extended his long arm and grabbed the back of her head. He put his face close to her eyes and said with his breath that was as fragrant as an orchid, "So what if it's disgusting?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want to never see her again. Even if he had to use this method, he wanted to keep her by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't love you, but other than that, I can give you everything you want. Haven&rsquo;t you always wanted a family? Then I can be your family&mdash;the best and perfect family. Isn't that great?" His warm breath sprayed on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His muttering voice was like the spell of the devil, making one tempted to say yes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the face that was right in front of her. Back then, she had loved him so much that she would have given her whole life to this man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought he would be her real family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, hearing the word &lsquo;family&rsquo; again, she felt an unspeakable sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe, it was like he said. By being his sis again, she could live without worry for the rest of her life and gain a lot, but... all these depended on his benefaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once he got tired of playing this family game, then she would be nothing again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." She gently spat out the word. Her voice was low, but she sounded unusually firm.</p></div>
