        <h1>Chapter 529</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Call my name, Grace. Call my name..." said Jason, his slightly hoarse voice sounded coquettish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay..." She called him by his name. The next moment, Jason&rsquo;s lips pressed hard against hers, and he kissed her in the most infatuating way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The voice that had whispered his name was the most beautiful sound in the world, and he wanted to treasure it for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Throughout the next few days, the Farmer family's tax evasion scandal was fully covered by the news media. If they had been trying to cover it up before, then now, the fig leaf was completely gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, the tax bureau had mustered enough evidence of the Farmer family's tax evasion and was now preparing to press further charges against the Farmer family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Consequently, the Farmer family was forced to pay the taxes and fines. Hence, their cash flow became restrained, and no bank was willing to lend them any money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Farmer family which once owned a huge convenience store chain empire was now teetering on the brink of a possible asset restructure and takeover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The series of events left many ordinary people dazzled, and some wondered how the Farmer family had been brought down so fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, people in their social circle, especially those that had attended the banquet that day, knew why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was probably the result of Tasha Farmer offending Jason that day. Tasha Farmer's actions had brought the entire Farmer family down with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elsie Jordan and Felicia Kemp, who had been with Tasha Farmer that day, were also scolded by their families. Fortunately, their family businesses only suffered a little and did not experience as bad of a crisis as the Farmer family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elsie Jordan and Felicia Kemp were also scared. Fortunately, Tasha Farmer had acted on her own by taking the initiative to target Grace. Although the two had fanned the flames, they had not picked on Grace directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was already misfortunate enough for the Farmer family. However, Tasha Farmer's eldest brother added fuel to the fire as shouted in Tasha Farmer's face that she had dissipated all the fortune that would have been his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. and Mrs. Wang had asked their circle of friends for help, but no one dared to help them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer had not expected to end up dragging the entire Farmer family down just by taunting Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There&hellip; There must be a mistake. How could Jason do this for a woman?" Tasha Farmer whispered to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, the truth was now right in front of her. Her social circle of female friends had also begun avoiding her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Elsie Jordan and Felicia Kemp, they eagerly wished to be unrelated to her. Additionally, her friends that often called themselves her sisters were now unwilling to give her a hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even had a friend say to her face, "You're way too impulsive, Tasha. Tell me. If a man like Jason had intentions of bringing a woman to a party himself, would he not find out about her background beforehand? Imprisonment? Hmph. It might be an unpleasant taint for ordinary people, but Jason is no ordinary person! Does he care if a woman has been to prison? He could even make a beggar a princess if he wanted to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tasha Farmer froze when she heard this. Yes, she had forgotten that Jason was no ordinary person. How could Jason not know something that even she knew?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, the Atkinson family has not uttered a single word. What's the hurry?" the girlfriend added, "Wasn't Lily there? Did you see her get upset and say something?"</p></div>
