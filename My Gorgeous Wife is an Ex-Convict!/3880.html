        <h1>Chapter 3878</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Mason had suggested, she could try the food and see if there were any other chefs who specialized in making meals for pregnant women that she preferred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to her pregnancy, she needed to have her blood checked again to see how the baby was developing. Therefore, Veronica took a few days off from school to rest at home, so as not to risk getting morning sickness or affecting the baby's health.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The results of the blood test, which was done every other day, relieved her. The baby was doing well and growing healthily, with the index doubling, indicating that the baby was healthy and growing well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, pregnancy lasts for 9 months, 40 weeks, and it's just the beginning now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She will spend every day with her baby well! Veronica silently promised in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These days, Veronica stayed in her small apartment. Mason would come back to accompany her when he had no classes, and of course, they would go to the hospital together for blood tests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica planned to recheck in a week. If the result was good, she would tell his family then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why wait another week to tell them?" Mason clearly didn't understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I'm afraid that the situation may not be good later, and they will be disappointed." After another week, they could also do an ultrasound to check the fetal sac and fetal heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the baby has a fetal sac and fetal heart, then it truly becomes a life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She has also looked up a lot of information these days and knows that there are many situations where the baby may not have a fetal sac and fetal heart at all, which also represents natural selection, and the baby is instinctively eliminated from her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He saw her worries and said, "Okay, then it's up to you. But I don't want you to feel pressured. No matter what happens to the baby in your belly, it's our business, not just yours. You don't need to care about whether others will be disappointed. You are the most important one, understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is Mason's comfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There are not too many sweet words, but it makes her feel very relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm." She responded softly. Whatever happens in the future, they will face it together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Veronica did not expect that the next day when Mason went to school, the doorbell of her apartment rang, and the person who came was the ones who had conflicts with her in the restaurant before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..." Veronica frowned and did not let the other party into the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She made it clear that she did not welcome these people in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We are here to apologize to you, Student Barlow," one of them smiled and spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cato and his girlfriend, who were the ones who had the most argument with Veronica in the restaurant earlier, looked embarrassed and no longer acted arrogantly like they did before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Student Barlow, we're sorry. It was just a small matter when we argued over a seat in the restaurant that day. We heard that you weren't feeling well, so we bought some milk and fruit to visit you," Cato's girlfriend said apologetically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although their tone was humble, there was still a sense of reluctance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Cato also spoke up, "Student Barlow, it was a misunderstanding that day. If you suffered any losses, I can compensate you. Please forgive me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at these people and understood that they probably knew about her relationship with Mason, so they came to apologize on purpose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, it was just fear of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for the Reed family, these people probably wouldn't have come to apologize to her.</p></div>
