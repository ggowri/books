        <h1>Chapter 1856</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Master, you came to see me again. It seems that you've encountered some trouble again, haven&rsquo;t you?" Secretary Wang said as he beamed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said with dark eyes, "Did you already know that Lawyer Kang's wife, Tang Yihui, is my mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He never believed coincidences. Many coincidences only happened due to someone's deliberate planning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Secretary Wang had sent Grace to L City back then, where she got to know Lawyer Kang and his wife. It seemed that there was a driving force behind it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Secretary Wang did not look surprised. "It seems that you&rsquo;ve found your mother. I do know who your mother is. Old master Reed knew about this too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's eyes instantly narrowed. 'Grandpa... knew?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Master, you&rsquo;ve been looking for that woman's whereabouts over the years. Old Master was doing the same as well. Think about it. How could Old master Reed let the woman go? But Old master Reed was already dying by the time I found out the woman's whereabouts, so he left the matter to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then why didn't you say anything? Why did you go through so much trouble?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Master, I went through so much trouble so that you can understand that no matter how much you love someone, that person might not meet your expectations,&rdquo; Secretary Wang said as if he had foreseen what had happened today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Secretary Wang took the initiative to say, "I would have told you about your mother if Grace had died, Young Master. But she didn't, so I wanted you to know that loving someone too much will only hurt yourself. You're the patriarch of the Reed family. You can have any woman you want. You don't have to be so obsessed with one woman!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said coldly, "Who are you to decide whether I should be obsessed with one woman? You sure have a knack for fooling me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Master, I just hope you can understand that feelings are nothing. The Reed family is the only thing you can control. As long as the Reed family remains standing, you&rsquo;ll always have power and wealth. You don't need to be afraid of losing anything!" said Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason sneered, his laughter full of sarcasm. 'No need to be afraid of losing anything?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though everything had been revealed now, he was no less afraid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The Reed family is important to you and Old Master, but it&rsquo;s nothing to me. Why don't you tell me what other things you have planned? Otherwise, if I find out that there&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll make sure you go and accompany Old master Reed right away! Maybe you can watch Reed group collapse before you go!" Jason said with a hint of menace in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had always been calculating, yet he had never been calculated against.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It seemed that it was Secretary Wang who was plotting against him, but it was actually Old master Reed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though the old master was dead, was he still influencing and controlling his life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Master, someday you'll realize that I'm right, and the love you thought you had is just a delusion. Do you want to follow in Master's footsteps again?" said Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason got up and left the room, ignoring what Secretary Wang said. He had asked all the questions he wanted to ask today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason got in the car after leaving the prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young master Reed, are we going back to Reed Residence?" the driver in the front asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, go to the old house," said Jason. The old house was the house his father rented with his mother when he was a child.</p></div>
