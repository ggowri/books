        <h1>Chapter 4186 Escape</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She took a deep breath and walked briskly ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She is now a mother, willing to take any risks to protect her unborn child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just as she was about to leave the village, suddenly, the flickering flames of the ritual extinguished!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She exclaimed in her mind, "Oh no!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This meant that the ritual ended earlier than she had anticipated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had to be quick! Quick to escape!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Before Drogo and the others returned home and discovered her escape, she had to leave the village as soon as possible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Suddenly, it started drizzling from the sky!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She forced a bitter smile. The rain would only slow her down and make her escape even more difficult!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Could it be that fate was going to throw even more obstacles her way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was particularly difficult for her to run with her big belly. Even walking briskly was already a heavy burden on her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She didn't know how long she had been walking, but finally... she walked out of the village, only to find an even longer road ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She remembered hearing someone say that if she walked a long road outside the village, she would reach the town where there was a police station and many people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If she made it to the town and found someone from the police, then she would be saved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even if she couldn't remember anything, the police would help her, help her find her family, and... the father of her child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> What kind of person was the father of her child?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although she couldn't remember, whenever she thought about it, she felt a sense of nostalgia. She must have loved the father of her child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just then, she heard the sound of hurried footsteps behind her, along with flashlight beams and people shouting, making her heart race even faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> They were chasing after her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had to be quick, she had to be fast!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had to escape from here quickly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Here! I see her, she's up ahead!" someone shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Then more footsteps echoed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "We can't let her get away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "If she escapes, the Drogo family will be finished! Where will Drogo find such a beautiful and lively daughter-in-law again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "The Drogo family promised that whoever helps them catch their daughter-in-law will be rewarded with 1000 dollars!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> 1000 dollars, in this backward village, was a big amount of money. The villagers who came to catch her became even more excited upon discovering her trail, their eyes shining!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As the crowd chasing her got closer and closer, she stumbled and fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Worriedly, she looked at her belly, relieved that she had been on all fours and her belly hadn't hit the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But her elbow joints and knees were throbbing with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, at a time like this, she couldn't care less about her injured body. All she had to do was run!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had to run, even if it was for the sake of the child in her belly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her body seemed to have an instinct telling her that no matter what, she had to protect this child, because this child was important to her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This kind of importance seemed to come not only from maternal love, but also from some other reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But she couldn't remember!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The footsteps behind her were getting closer and closer. Just as it seemed like she was about to be caught, suddenly, she saw a car approaching not far away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The bright headlights stung her eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But at this moment, the car lights were her last hope of escaping from here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She exerted all her strength, waving her hand towards the car and running towards it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The car slammed on the brakes just a few meters away from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Bathed in the light of the car headlights, she looked straight at the man sitting in the driver's seat through the windshield!</p></div>
