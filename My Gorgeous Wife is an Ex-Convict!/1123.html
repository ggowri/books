        <h1>Chapter 1122</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jealousy flashed across Paisley Daniels's eyes as she looked at Nelson Corbyn, who was standing next to Kyla Corbyn. She never expected Kyla Corbyn to be able to give birth to a child in prison!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, she lost the ability to conceive and was now even being forced to raise Kyla Corbyn's child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels said, "Kyla, long time no see. I heard Martin say that Nelson is his child. In that case, I'll treat Nelson as my own!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Paisley Daniels spoke, she gestured to the driver behind her who was now holding several children's toys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"These are the toys I prepared for Nelson. I don't know where you live, so I could only come here to pass them to you." A gentle smile appeared on the corner of Paisley Daniels's lips as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla Corbyn could not help but tremble when she saw the smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels had also smiled at her in the same gentle way back then, but in the blink of an eye, Paisley Daniels staged the scene of her falling down the stairs. What would Paisley Daniels do this time around?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost subconsciously, Kyla Corbyn hid her son behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you up to?" Kyla Corbyn asked, looking defensive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What can I be up to? I just want to be nice to Nelson. After all, he's Martin's son and will be my son soon," Paisley Daniels said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson will never be your son!" said Kyla Corbyn. How could she let her son be the child of the woman who made her bear a crime?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's hand could not help but clench her son's hand tighter. It was as if she feared that the woman in front of her would take away her most precious treasure again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, ouch!" The little one's face could not help but wrinkle up. The child could not understand why his mother looked so nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, why did the other aunt say that he would be her son? He was clearly Mommy's son!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn realized that she had accidentally hurt her son, so she quickly let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels's voice rang again. "Why would you do this? Kyla, you cruelly pushed me down the stairs and made me miscarry, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's face suddenly turned pale, and she immediately said, "Stop it!" She wanted Paisley Daniels to stop talking about it. Especially in a place like this where they were surrounded by kindergarteners and parents. Most importantly... Nelson was beside them too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Paisley Daniels ignored Kyla Corbyn and kept talking to her, "You've gone to prison and paid for your crimes. It's just that an ex-convict like you isn't cut out to raise children, after all. It's best to hand the child to Martin and me. So why give all of us a hard time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn trembled suddenly. Her face had already turned pale. Even the hand holding her son was rapidly turning cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nonsense! My mommy didn't go to prison. Only bad people go to prison!" Nelson snarled at Paisley Daniels as he darted out from behind Kyla Corbyn like a lion cub.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not quite understand what the aunt was saying, but he understood when she said his mother had gone to prison.</p></div>
