        <h1>Chapter 2059</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla shook her head. "No, we only chatted a little."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She looked at the time and said to her son, "Alright. Nelson, you haven't done your homework, have you? Why don't you go to bed? I'll go to school tomorrow and explain what happened to the teacher. You can do it tomorrow..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before she could finish, Nelson Corbyn said, "I'll go work on my homework!" With that said, he opened his bag to take out his workbook and pencil case. He then said to Kyla, "Mommy, I... I won't get bullied anymore. You don't have to worry about me. I'm a man. It doesn't hurt!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's eyes watered as she watched her son do his homework as he bent over the small table. His red and swollen face was so obvious under the lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It doesn't hurt? How could it not hurt?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, she learned from her mother at the police station that the kids had fought with Nelson. Nelson was the only one being beaten. He only protected the hearing aid in his ear so that it would not break again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At night, Kyla lay in bed, tossing and turning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's voice rang in her ears again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Marry me... Marry me... Marry me...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It repeated again and again like a spell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Stop thinking about it!' Kyla told herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Under no circumstances will I marry Martin Weiss! But...' Her eyes fell on Nelson lying beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She looked at his tender face. She had seen him injured many times in the past few days. No matter how hard she tried, she could not prevent Nelson from getting hurt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Only Martin Weiss could stop it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla raised her hand to gently stroke her son's cheek. "I'm sorry..." she muttered. Her soft but pained voice drifted in the air...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss stood in front of an old apartment building as his eyes looked coldly at his surroundings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The subordinate beside him said, "Mr. Weiss, this is it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, they led the way while Martin Weiss followed them toward the apartment stairway. Finally, they came to the door of one of the apartment units.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Inside, several men in black suits surrounded a woman in revealing clothes. Her makeup was thick, looking just like those working in a &lsquo;unique&rsquo; industry. She did not have a welcoming smile on her face but a look of terror. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the woman saw the man entering the room after the door opened, her eyes suddenly widened. Shock, fear, pain, bewilderment, and finally hatred flashed across her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss!" The woman almost spat out the words through clenched teeth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Paisley Daniels, it's been so long since we met." Martin Weiss looked at the person in front of him with a cold expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hmph, I can sue you for breaking and entering by barging into my house like this!" said Paisley Daniels. As much as she loved this man previously, that was just as much as she hated him now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If it were not for him, she would not have ended up like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can try! Let's see if you can win the lawsuit," Martin Weiss said coldly as he looked at her with thick disgust. "You have many people coming in and out of your place every day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Paisley Daniels's expression changed before she showed a mocking smile. "Yes, many people come and leave here every day. Some of them even paid me more when they found out I'm the ex-fiancee of Weiss Group's chairman! They asked me to serve them the same way I served you."</p></div>
