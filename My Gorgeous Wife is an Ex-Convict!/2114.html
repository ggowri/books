        <h1>Chapter 2112</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Life went on as usual. However, ever since Martin Weiss set off the firecrackers and distributed wedding candies, Kyla could distinctly feel the change in her neighbors' gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps that was the way people were. She would divorce Martin Weiss after the baby was one year old. Then, she would move to another place once Nelson went to junior high.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A divorced woman with two children would have a better reputation than an unmarried woman with two children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was ridiculous. She had never cared much about reputation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, reality forced her to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">While Kyla was contemplating what she could do after her son graduated from primary school, a black Maybach pulled up at the store&rsquo;s entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A woman in a modified cheongsam stepped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was an elderly in her 60s. She also wore a fall-season cloak. Her hair was in an updo while she wore delicate makeup. She looked dignified and graceful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla shuddered as she recognized her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was the matriarch of the Weiss family... Martin Weiss's mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Speaking of which, she had only met her once. She accidentally ran into her back when she was dating Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Weiss was indifferent to her and did not care about her relationship with Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she was in jail, she figured out that Mrs. Weiss did not care because she knew Martin Weiss was not really in love with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As Mrs. Weiss walked up to her, Kyla asked calmly, "Can I help you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I should have visited you long ago. Now that you and Martin are married, you should call me 'Mom', right? Kyla?" said Mrs. Weiss. Instead of the indifference Kyla had seen before, Mrs. Weiss's expression now seemed a little... obsequious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she could not bring herself to call this woman &lsquo;Mom&rsquo; no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Weiss did not insist either. She only said a little sheepishly, "Speaking of which, the Weiss family and the Corbyn family have such an ill-fated relationship. Your father almost brought down the Weiss family, and Martin was hospitalized for leukemia. I almost couldn't take it. I really hated the Corbyn family at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But you happened to be the one who saved Martin. If you had refused to donate your bone marrow like Paisley Daniels, then Martin would have already died. And Martin wouldn't have been able to revive the Weiss family after our downfall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You saved Martin with your bone marrow, and Martin also cut out his liver for you. Our feud has long been incalculable. I know you've suffered a lot. The Weiss family has done you and Nelson wrong. I don't want to deal with all this anymore. I only want my son to live like a human being and not live in pain forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Weiss's voice had a hint of imploration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Never had a woman of her status spoken to anyone in such a tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was stunned. She never expected Mrs. Weiss to do this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, you're a mother too. Since you would marry Martin for the sake of your unborn child, you must know how I feel. A mother can do anything for their children," Mrs. Weiss said earnestly as her hands grabbed Kyla's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was silent. As a mother, she naturally understood how Mrs. Weiss felt, but...</p></div>
