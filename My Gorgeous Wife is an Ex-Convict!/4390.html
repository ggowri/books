        <h1>Chapter 4388 You're Also Very Beautiful</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing, I just find it quite amazing. In just two years, you've become famous," Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there a problem?" Calvert asked, his brow slightly furrowed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's great. Your success proves that I have good taste," Harley said with a laugh. After all, his entry into this circle was her recommendation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll work even harder," he suddenly said with great seriousness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She chuckled lightly, "You're already working so hard, how much harder do you want to push yourself? You're filming and doing fashion shows, with hardly any time to rest. Didn't you even faint in your apartment before?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for the housekeeping staff, he probably would have stayed in the hospital for a few more days!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the reason he fainted that time was due to extreme fatigue!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just feel that now is the time for me to strive," Calvert said. "If I don't work hard now, there might not be a chance to do so in the future, even if I want to."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley looked at the person in front of him. In this circle, many people who gained fame became arrogant, thinking that this state could last for a long time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in that circle, there were only a handful of people who could maintain high influence for a long time. Most people might have enjoyed their moment of fame, but like fireworks, they faded away in an instant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert, on the other hand, had a clear understanding of this. Even though he was famous at that time, he remained humble and always had a sense of crisis.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what, even if you're working hard now, you need to take care of your health. Don't ruin your body for the sake of your career. That would be a loss rather than a gain," Harley advised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright." Calvert obediently agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Harley's phone rang. Picking it up, Harley spoke into the device after a brief conversation, "Sure, I'll pick you up! I guarantee a safe ride!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She ended the call with a beaming smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert looked puzzled, "What are you taking?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I'm off to pick up a kid from kindergarten! I've been playing with this child a lot recently, so she insisted that I pick her up after school," Harley explained.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Child?" Calvert was taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, her name is Quinn, she's really adorable!" Harley eagerly showed Calvert a photo of her and Quinn on her phone.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the photo, Harley was holding a little girl who was about 4 years old. </span><span>Both of them</span><span> had joyful smiles on their faces, creating a warm and beautiful scene.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's adorable, isn't she? I just love her!" Harley said, obviously referring to Quinn.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Calvert felt that the truly adorable one was Harley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'm off now, </span><span>gotta</span><span> pick up the kid!" said Harley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go with you," Calvert blurted out. They had finally managed to meet up, and he didn't want to part ways so soon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert saw Harley seemed to freeze, and asked somewhat uneasily, "Is that okay?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Would this take up too much of your time?" Harley pondered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I don't have any other plans today, I'm totally free!" he quickly replied.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, let's go pick up Quinn together," Harley said with a smile. "Speaking of which, Quinn is quite a fan of yours. I even showed her your poster once, and she said this uncle is so handsome!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a kid talking nonsense," said Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I think you're very beautiful too," Harley said.</span></p></div>
