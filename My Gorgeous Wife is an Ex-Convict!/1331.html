        <h1>Chapter 1330</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said nothing. No matter how mean his words were now, they could no longer hurt her. The time she had left was reserved for her mother and Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll give you the agreement now," she said and glanced at her arm, which was still in his grip. "Mr. Weiss, can you let me go now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a cold face, Martin Weiss loosened his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn took the lead while Martin Weiss looked at her back, suddenly feeling a terrible emptiness... in his palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was clear that she was complying with his request, but why did he feel so uncomfortable?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn and Martin Weiss came to the house she rented.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no one at home as Mrs. Corbyn was also out. Kyla Corbyn went into the room, took out a pen and paper, and asked Martin Weiss, "What do you want me to write?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her and said, "Just write that you're giving up custody and you'll hand Nelson to me in three months. From then on, you won't show up in front of him or have any private correspondence with him. Don't try any tricks. If you try anything, I'll make you suffer more than you ever did in jail."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry. I won't play any tricks. I won't be involved in Nelson's future at all," she said lightly. She lowered her head and began to write down what he wanted her to on the paper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I won't be involved... in Nelson's future, because I won&rsquo;t have the opportunity to.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she had was these three months, and she only hoped that she could spend the happiest time with her son and mother in these three months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He narrowed his eyes as if he was a little unaccustomed to her calmness. It was as if nothing he said could stir her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he no longer held a place in her eyes and heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He used to occupy her eyes and heart. She even liked to hold his face and would say coquettishly, "Martin, look at me. I like it when you look at me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now it seemed she did not even bother to look at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn finished writing the contents of the agreement. She signed it, took out the ink stamp, and stamped her fingerprint where her signature was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When everything was completed, she handed the agreement to Martin Weiss. "That's all, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss glanced at the agreement. "Are you so eager to finish writing the agreement to get rid of Nelson so you can start your new life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's personal. You have no right to ask, Mr. Weiss." She still maintained the same indifferent expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's teeth suddenly tingled with hatred. He was supposed to be the one calling shots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the one begging him, but why did he feel as if she was the one calling shots?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is the man that great?" He suddenly grabbed her wrist and forced her into a corner. "Didn't you say Nelson was your everything and you didn't want another child? Yet now you're willing to have a second child with another man?"</p></div>
