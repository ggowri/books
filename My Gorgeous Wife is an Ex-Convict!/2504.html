        <h1>Chapter 2502</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It all depends on luck, the baby's luck and mine." Her voice choked slightly as she looked down and said to the little baby in her belly whose heartbeat had just developed, "Baby, will you give your best and let me give birth to you? I'm dying to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What answered her was a hug from Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A week. It would take a week for them to confirm if she was physically fit to continue the pregnancy. However, the test results they had received today were not too bad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace told herself to stay happy and take care of her diet now so that the baby could be healthy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two walked toward the inpatient department, intending to visit Kyla. However, Kyla's ward was empty when they reached it. Even the bodyguards Jason had assigned to protect Kyla were nowhere to be seen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly asked the nurse at the nurses&rsquo; station and learned that there was suddenly something wrong with Kyla's condition earlier. The doctor had taken her to the operating room for a C-section after checking on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? A C-section?" Grace was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, the patient wanted to hold on for a few more days before delivering the baby, but the doctor said it&rsquo;ll probably kill both mother and baby if she doesn&rsquo;t have a C-section now," the nurse replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's heart instantly sank. Although Kyla was having a C-section and the baby was already seven months old, babies that young had a low survival rate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that Kyla intended to wait until the baby was eight months old before delivering them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the doctor had urgently brought Kyla over for a C-section. She must be in critical condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After asking the nurse for the location of the operating room, Grace and Jason hurried to the waiting area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace saw Mrs. Corbyn and the bodyguards here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two bodyguards hurried forward to report the situation, and Mrs. Corbyn looked like she was about to cry. "What do we do? Isn't her C-section supposed to be in a week or two? Why did it suddenly... The doctor sounded pretty serious. Is Kyla going to be okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The elderly woman was at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurried to comfort Mrs. Corbyn. "I just asked the nurse. Kyla has the best doctors operating on her, and they&rsquo;ve been studying Kyla's case. It'll be okay. Kyla will make it through."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Grace did not mention was that the doctors had said that Kyla's liver was taking too big of a toll on her. Without a liver transplant after the C-section, Kyla would probably not survive for longer than a year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they had not found the right liver so far. Martin Weiss was the only person who could donate his liver to Kyla, but Martin Weiss&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After calming Mrs. Corbyn down, Grace called Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The phone rang several times before the call was finally picked up. "What's the matter?" Martin Weiss's deep and cold voice came from the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla's condition suddenly became critical, and the doctors are now performing an emergency C-section on Kyla in the operating room. I thought as her husband and the father of the baby, you should come over and take a look," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other end of the line was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's heart was racing as she nervously waited for his reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would Martin Weiss come? If Martin Weiss came, it would at least show that he had feelings for Kyla. If he did not, it meant he intended to get over Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace eventually heard the busy signal at the other end of the line.</p></div>
