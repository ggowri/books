        <h1>Chapter 1278</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Kyla Corbyn had heard the bodyguard calling Jason to report the incident and knew that with Jason's ability, he would bring Grace back safely, she still had to hear it from Grace herself before she could feel at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine, Kyla. Don't worry," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good." Kyla Corbyn breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, how's Nelson? I'll come and visit him next time I'm free," said Grace. It had been a long time since she visited the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn hesitated for a moment before saying, "Nelson's fine. He misses you too. Alright, I gotta go back to work. I have customers here. I'll talk to you next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said, quickly ending the phone call and putting away her phone. However, there were no new customers at her food stall at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled wryly as she lowered her head. She just did not know how to tell Grace. There had been so much going on these days. Grace was pregnant, and she did not want her friend to worry about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that the following days after Nelson was discharged from the hospital, her son kept having some bruises and minor injuries on his body. The kindergarten teacher also said that the child often had conflicts with other children in the kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the reason, the teacher only discreetly mentioned that it had something to do with some of her experiences. Kyla Corbyn immediately understood when she heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Imprisonment. It had to do with her imprisonment. That experience was like a smirch branded on her forever, which also made Nelson suffer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I only want my son to grow up safely, but why is something so normal for all mothers so difficult for me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Also, can I really win the custody case?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's eyes dimmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, Grace turned her head and asked the butler nearby, "Where's Master Reed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Over in the mourning hall," the butler replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace decided to head toward the mourning hall, but as she was about to leave the main house, the butler suddenly stopped her and said, "Young Madam, I hope you'll treat Master Reed well. Master Reed is... really like his father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The butler lowered his head and stopped looking at Grace after saying that. After all, he was not supposed to be the one to say this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he had worked for the Reed family for years. When he saw Master Reed's parents being thrown out of the Reed family back then and little Master Reed returning to the Reed family with an urn of ashes in his hands afterward, he could not help but sigh with sorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Reed family seemed glamorous, but it was secretly dreadful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, the Reed family finally had two happy events happening at the same time. Master Reed was married and had three babies on the way. He sincerely hoped that there would be laughter in the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know. I won't let him end up like his father!" Grace said with great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she turned and walked in the direction of the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she walked into the mourning hall, she saw Jason standing in front of his father's memorial tablet as he had done last time, as still as a statue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The yellow light fell on him, making him look lonely and cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay!" she could not help calling out to him. Somehow, her heart ached every time she saw him standing like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He turned around slowly, and his dark eyes looked at her. Suddenly, he quickly walked toward her, put his arms around her, and leaned forward. He rested his head on her shoulder like an exhausted man who had finally found a place to rest.</p></div>
