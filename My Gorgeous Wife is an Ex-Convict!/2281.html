        <h1>Chapter 2279</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I... want to know why he&rsquo;s here looking for me," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Kyla asked the nurse to let Neal Reid into the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After entering the ward, Neal Reid was not as arrogant as he was before. Instead of looking like a noble businessman, he was haggard. Even the suit he was wearing was a little wrinkled. He looked so down and out. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid said uneasily, "Uh... Mr. Weiss, Mrs. Weiss, what Jacqueline Bowman did this time has nothing to do with the Hunter family. I knew nothing about it, nor did I participate in it. It was her idea alone! I broke up with her long before she did anything to Mrs. Weiss! You can look into it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't understand why you&rsquo;re telling us this, Mr. Wu? If you're afraid of being implicated, you should be talking to the police, not us," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid was groaning inwardly. The police did not arrest him because he had nothing to do with the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, even though he was innocent, many people in the business circle knew that Jacqueline Bowman was his lover. Now that Jacqueline Bowman had been arrested, many businessmen in Emerald City knew about it even though it was not reported in the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, some people who had business dealings with him had recently started to distance themselves from him, saying that he had offended Martin Weiss and might end up like the Yu family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the thought of the Yu family and Mr. Lambert's fate, Neal Reid could not help shuddering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mrs. Weiss, my... my business has been greatly affected by Jacqueline Bowman's incident. Everyone is saying that I've offended the Weiss family and will probably be in trouble. Please be the bigger person and let me off. I... I'm innocent." All Neal Reid had left to do was kneel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you didn&rsquo;t participate, the Weiss family won&rsquo;t do anything to you," said Martin Weiss, but his voice was utterly hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... But no one dares to do business with the Hunter family now. I wonder if you can release a statement or something to clarify this matter, Mr. Weiss," said Neal Reid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss sneered. " Neal Reid, who do you think you are to have the Weiss family clarify this matter for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid felt a chill rising on his back as his hands and feet broke out in a cold sweat. "Mister... Mr. Weiss, I... I'm really innocent! That b*tch Jacqueline Bowman not only troubled you but she troubled me too! We&rsquo;re both victims!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was afraid that talking too much might affect Martin Weiss's wounds, so she hurriedly said to Neal Reid, "Mr. Wu, your business has nothing to do with the Weiss family. How you explain it to your friends in the business circle is your business. My husband is still sick and needs rest. Please leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla told him to leave, and Neal Reid's face instantly turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss froze because of the words &lsquo;my husband.&rsquo; Then, his eyes glowed with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the first time she had ever referred him as her husband to an outsider!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did that mean she... was willing to accept him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could Neal be willing to leave like that? After a moment's hesitation, he finally bit the bullet and said, "Mrs. Weiss, I... I went to see Jacqueline Bowman at the detention center before I came here. She said she wants to see you and that she has something important to talk to you about. You&rsquo;ll regret it if you don&rsquo;t go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman had indeed asked him to pass the message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want to pass the message along at first because he was afraid that the Weiss family would think that he still had relations with Jacqueline Bowman. If that was the case, he would be implicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, at this point, he had to make every possible effort.</p></div>
