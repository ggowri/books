        <h1>Chapter 2074</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Samantha Dean threatened. It was clear that she was asking for money. She had listened to her lover's advice and invested all the money she got from the divorce and the mortgage on the house in her lover's business. However, the business failed to get off the ground and she was now in debt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hence, she wanted to use Chase Harper's shop to settle the debt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper's face turned red. His ex-wife's shameless threat put him in a dilemma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla took one step forward and looked coldly at Samantha Dean. "Chase and I are just friends. Be ready to bear the consequences if you want to spread rumors. I&rsquo;ll sue whoever dares spread rumors about me till the end. I'll sue you until you lose all your money. I&rsquo;ll make you publish a statement and apologize to me in the newspaper!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla exuded a harsh chill as if she would do anything to protect the people who mattered most to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her aura crushed Samantha Dean and made her gasp for breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Step by step, Kyla approached Samantha Dean. "Try it if you don't believe me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..." Samantha Dean's face turned red, and she swung her hand toward Kyla in anger. "You... I'll kill you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla ducked to avoid her, while Chase Harper rushed to hold Samantha Dean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, another hand was faster as it slapped Samantha Dean, causing her to stagger back several steps to steady herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Samantha Dean covered her face and stared blankly at the handsome, cold man in front of her. The crisp suit he wore and the imposing manner he exuded made him seem like a man of high rank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Who... Who are you? You hit me, so I'm calling the police," shouted Samantha Dean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss did not even look at her. He only turned to ask Kyla, "Did she hurt you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm alright," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Samantha Dean looked at the way Martin Weiss was concerned about Kyla and felt a pang of jealousy. 'This woman isn't very beautiful, but Chase Harper and this dignified man are both taking her side.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't you know how intimate this woman is with my ex-husband? They are so intimate. Speaking of which, a widow with a child won&rsquo;t be able to stand loneliness..." Samantha Dean began to speak nastily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, halfway through her statement, Samantha Dean was slapped in the face again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Slap! Slap! Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The third, the fourth, the fifth... The slaps were incessant. Samantha Dean's cheeks were swollen, and blood oozed from the corners of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you going to go on?" asked Martin Weiss as he looked at Samantha Dean coldly. He did not show mercy even though she was a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Samantha Dean looked terrified as she trembled. She had a feeling that she would suffer more than just slaps if she stayed any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Samantha Dean fled as fast as she could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper looked at Kyla apologetically and said, "I didn't know she would come here and make a scene. I'll try... to sort this out with her. I won't let her come and make a scene again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After what had happened, Kyla could now see that Samantha Dean was a woman even more shameless than she had thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If an honest man like Chase Harper was going to deal with a shameless person like Samantha Dean, he might give her his shop to avoid trouble.</p></div>
