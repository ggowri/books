        <h1>Chapter 2050</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He got his men to investigate the situation in Nelson&rsquo;s school and learned that many students discriminated against his son because of his hearing issue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Those who discriminated against his son only knew that his son's mother was an ex-convict. Even if he had already reversed the case for Kyla, many people did not care about whether the court made the wrong judgment and would only continue to discriminate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What made Martin Weiss miserable the most was that he caused these people to discriminate against Kyla and Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I asked you to check on Paisley Daniels. How is it going?" After reading the information, Martin Weiss slowly asked the person in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Paisley Daniels has been released from prison and arrived in Emerald City a few days ago. We haven't found out her specific whereabouts, but she's probably still in Emerald City," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes grew cold. "Then find her. Find this person for me even if you have to flip Emerald City around!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It's all because of this woman Paisley Daniels... If this woman hadn't interfered, would things between Kyla and me go this far?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Paisley Daniels is so lucky to only spend five years in prison!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'This woman is probably up to no good since she came to Emerald City after being released from prison. I want Paisley Daniels to continue to pay the price for what she did back then&hellip;&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla went to the small market to stock up her store again and stopped by Chase Harper's shop. Chase Harper was talking to his staff. Seeing Kyla, he hurriedly stepped forward and asked, "Are you here to restock your store today?" His eyes glanced at the things she was carrying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "Yeah, I'm done with buying the things, so I dropped by to visit you. Those two people didn't bother you after you fixed my tricycle, did they?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, their garage has been penalized. Two security guards and one administrator from the market were taken to the police station too. I heard they were working with the garage. No one dares to have such ideas anymore," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's good." Kyla smiled. Then, she took out a pair of flower hairpins and handed them to Chase Harper. "These are the flower hairpins I bought for Juliet. You can put them on for her after you braid her hair."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's so generous of you!" Chase Harper said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"After all you've done for me, buying Juliet some trinkets is nothing. Besides, Juliet is adorable," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you..." Chase Harper accepted the flower hairpins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla prepared to leave, and Chase Harper quickly said, "Let me help you carry these things to your tricycle." Without waiting for Kyla to say anything, he took the bags of things from her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla smiled at this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They went to the car park outside the market together, and Chase Harper placed all the bags on Kyla's little tricycle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Be careful on the road and don't ride too fast," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, got it. Hurry back," said Kyla as she rode away on her electric tricycle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper watched Kyla's back for a few moments before turning back to the market.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Not far away, Martin Weiss was sitting in a black car, staring darkly at Chase Harper's back. His face was covered with a layer of gloom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Chase Harper returned to his shop, his staff member asked curiously, "Boss, who was that just now? She looks pretty. She seems gentle too. She owns the tricycle we fixed last time, right? You even sent it back yourself after fixing it. She's not your future wife, is she?"</p></div>
