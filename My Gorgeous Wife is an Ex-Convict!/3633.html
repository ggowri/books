        <h1>Chapter 3631</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was startled by the voice and immediately looked up to see who it was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a tall young man with a pair of gold-rimmed glasses perched on his nose. He appeared refined but also carried a hint of melancholy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason!" Jasper exclaimed with joy, quickly getting up and walking towards the person. "Why did you come back today?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll be studying as an exchange student at Stanford University for the next six months," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Six months?" Jasper's face lit up with excitement. "Why didn't you mention it earlier? That means we can be alumni for half a year!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm," Mason replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Known for his cool demeanor, Mason showed little expression on his face, which contrasted sharply with Jasper's enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, do you like men?" Mason asked, looking at Mick, referring to his previous question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick raised an eyebrow and stood up. "What if I said I do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, congratulations," Jasper replied promptly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick looked at his younger brother. "Unfortunately, I haven't fallen in love yet. Whether it's with a man or a woman, I don't really mind. But... right now, there's no one who makes me feel like I want to spend every moment with them and never get tired of it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although there were always women around him, such as when his mother and her friends gathered and brought all of their children along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was also familiar with the girls from the Stephenson family, the Hart family, and the Weiss family, in addition to having two younger sisters of his own. So he didn't exclude women, but he found it... troublesome.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For example, like Chandler, he has to accompany Tina to chase after stars. It seems like Chandler is in control of Tina, but he actually feels like Tina is in control of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina spends all day with the Weiss family's little girl, Trista, as well as Harley and her own little sister, Jasmine. The four of them get together to chase after stars, gossip about celebrities, and occasionally sneak off to special bars to broaden their horizons.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time they do this, it gives him, Chandler, Nelson, and Harley's fianc&eacute;, Lornell, a headache. They all just stare at each other, at a loss. So, in Mick's eyes, women, at times, equal trouble!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if there really is someone who makes you want to spend your days and nights together, it doesn't mean you'll actually end up together. The human heart is the most difficult thing to control in this world," Mason said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick was taken aback and raised an eyebrow. "What's this? Did my words just make you think of Veronica?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason, however, looked Mick straight in the eye and said in a indifferent tone, "Why should I think of her? She and I have no connection anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Mick said. "Jasper told me earlier that he saw Veronica at a charity event. It seems like she's been through a lot. She was publicly humiliated and had drinks thrown at her, but she didn't dare say a word. Even though the Reed family could pay for her education, she insisted on working her way through as a celebrity assistant. And yet, she still ended up </span><span>being humiliated like that. It's really quite pitiful."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick rarely spoke so much at once, but unfortunately, Mason's reaction disappointed him.</span></p></div>
