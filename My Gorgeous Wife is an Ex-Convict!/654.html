        <h1>Chapter 653</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been to Emerald City with Brian these days, so of course, she understood more about what the name Jason meant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was even... Her cousin's boyfriend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Hasn't Grace been to prison? How did she find a boyfriend like that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not just Jason, but... Stella Lindsay glanced at Brian who was next to her. She managed to calm herself and force out a smile. "You're Mr. Reed! Grace, why didn't you tell us that your boyfriend&rsquo;s Mr. Reed when you brought him back the last time? Anybody would think we were strangers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt immediately said with a smile, "Hey, Grace, you're lucky to have Mr. Reed as your boyfriend. Your grandmother would rest in peace if she knew. Big Brother, Second Brother, why are you still standing there? Hurry and apologize to Grace! What you did last time was way out of line!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt's attitude took a completely new turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">First Uncle and Second Uncle looked at each other. They no longer seemed as arrogant as before. They immediately smiled and said things like, "We're sorry, but it was only for your sake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was indifferent to her uncles' apologies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she just hoped that her relatives would not cause too much of a commotion and disturb her grandmother's funeral! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The undertakers came over to put her grandmother's cerements on and put her body in the frozen transparent coffin. Watching her grandmother lying in the transparent coffin as if she was sound asleep, Grace burst into tears again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grandma!&rdquo; shouted Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the elderly in the transparent coffin could no longer answer her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was holding Grace as he knew that she was losing her footing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grandma's body and coffin were first transported back to the Lu family's house. It was customary to leave the body at home for three days before cremation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The funeral company had already set up the Lu family's house with the memorial tablet, altar, and everything else needed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The neighbors and relatives in town also knew that Old Mrs. Lu had died, so they came to pay their respects. The Lu family went to entertain the neighbors and relatives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Grace sat down with a chair next to the crystal coffin while silently looking at the elderly inside. When someone came to see Old Mrs. Lu, Grace got up and bowed in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know how much time had passed when Jason walked over to her with a pair of shoes and clothes in hand. "Change out of your wedding dress. It's inconvenient for you to do anything in it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up at Jason. He was always like this, silently taking care of everything for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded and took her clothes to the bathroom to change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she got changed and came out, Jason looked at Grace's still visibly red and swollen eyes. He said, "Don't be so sad. Your grandmother certainly wouldn't want to see you so sad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grandma&hellip; Was very kind to me. When I was here, Grandma took good care of me. Even if I wanted a new dress, Grandma would buy it for me even if it was expensive," Grace said wearily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was talking when she was suddenly interrupted by Jason. "All right, I know how much your grandmother means to you. I'll treat you better, Grace. I'll treat you better than anyone else in the world."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Out of the corner of his eye, he glanced toward Brian and Stella Lindsay who were walking this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay saw that Grace had already changed out of her wedding dress and the outfit she was wearing was from a luxury brand she had seen in magazines before. However, when she went to inquire, the sales assistant told her it was a limited edition. Even if she pre-ordered it, she might not get it.</p></div>
