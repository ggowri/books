        <h1>Chapter 4096</h1>
        <div>.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler's body trembled, and every word the old man spoke felt like he was mercilessly uncovering things that Chandler least wanted to think about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop talking!" Chandler shouted weakly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Chandler, Grandpa just wants you to understand that no matter what, you must let Tina give birth to your child so that you can live well. And..." Grandpa paused and looked deeply at his grandson, who was lying on the ground in a miserable state. "If you don't want to go through this pain again, you should marry her as soon as possible. There's no need to wait for her graduation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grandpa continued, "There are still two years until she graduates, but during these two years, many things could happen. You are eight years older than her. Are you really sure that during these two years, she won't be tempted by anyone else? Will she obediently marry you when it's time to get married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler suddenly shook, thinking of the scenes of Tina and Kit shooting posters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is that man a temptation for Tina?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that Tina only saw him as a favorite idol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But would this liking change one day?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If Tina wants a divorce in the future, would you agree?" Grandpa's words were like a heavy blow, hitting Chandler hard and making him feel a sharp pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gritted his teeth and endured the pain in his body. "I...I will agree. If she really doesn't love me and falls in love with someone else, then...I can let her go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he had thought countless times that he would never let her go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But if she really couldn't accept him, then...he could let her go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..." Mr. Hunter glared angrily at his grandson. "Don't you want to live?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler closed his eyes and endured the pain surging through his body again and again. "After Tina graduates, I will...tell her about my physical condition...If she really doesn't want to marry me, then the engagement between the Hunter family and the Stephenson family will be cancelled..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to let Hunter's family line end with you?" The old man was furious. "How could I have a grandson like you? Everyone said you were lucky to find someone who could cure the curse at such a young age, but what have you done? You've been dragging your feet on your marriage with Tina for so many years, and now you're saying such irresponsible things!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grandfather...my life, whether I live or die...should be my own decision," Chandler said intermittently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've been blinded by love!" Mr. Hunter scolded angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina, who was listening outside, felt confused. She understood every word they said, but the meaning behind them was unclear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What did her marriage to Chandler have to do with life and death? And...it seemed like she had to bear a child, not just for the sake of continuing the family line, but to make sure Chandler wouldn't die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Tina was lost in thought, someone grabbed her shoulder and pushed her inside before she could react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Master, she was eavesdropping outside!" the person holding Tina's shoulder said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was one of Hunter's security personnel patrolling at night. They weren't supposed to approach the church, but they saw Tina listening by the door and brought her in.</p></div>
