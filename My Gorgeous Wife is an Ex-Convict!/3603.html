        <h1>Chapter 3601</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harold and Camelia watched the backs of the two people, looking at each other in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That girl just now...she's Jason and Grace's daughter, right? I remember reading about her in the news, her name is Jasper."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, that's the child."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, she and William..." Camelia hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harold sighed bitterly, "It's all a tragedy! A curse!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in that short moment just now, he could tell that his grandson was afraid that Jasper would find out about their identities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To their grandson, their existence is a sin, a shame!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He remembered that the news mentioned that their grandson and the Reed family's girl were childhood friends who grew up together, and they had a good relationship!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Atkinson family and the Reed family, who were once supposed to be in-laws, turned into enemies. Who would have thought that their descendants would develop such a strong bond.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It can only be said that things are unpredictable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Jasper and William entered the elevator. Jasper asked curiously, "Isn't Building 3 the hospital? Are they here for a medical check-up? But why are they carrying water and snacks?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe they are here to thank a doctor, it's not really important, you don't need to think too much about it," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it really like that? But Jasper has a strange feeling, as if William doesn't want to mention these two old people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she quickly suppressed this strange feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps she's overthinking it, after all, those two old people are just unrelated strangers!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...After returning from Deer Capital to Emerald City, Jasper Grace continued her classes as usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The posts about her and Roger's rumors on the forum have also been deleted, and it didn't have much impact on her university life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there were not many people who dared to point fingers at her in front of her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for the whispers behind her back, Mason didn't care.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From a young age, there have been plenty of people talking behind her back. If she constantly worries about what others say, she'll never be able to live her life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One afternoon during a public class, Jasper couldn't help but notice that many of her classmates were looking back at her, and the way they looked at her seemed quite strange.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was puzzled, wondering if her rumored relationship with Roger on campus hadn't ended yet. Or perhaps there was a new post about her on the school forum?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the class ended, Meave rushed up to her and said, "Jasper, something's not right. There's a post on the forum, it's about..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"About me?" Jasper interrupted, "What is it this time? Did someone take a picture of me with another guy and post it on the forum?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... it's not that!" Meave quickly replied, "Well, it does have something to do with you, but it's mainly about William!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper froze, "About William?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She quickly took out her phone and opened the school forum.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, the most popular post on the forum had a title that read, "The Son of a Criminal Turns out to be the Prince of Stanford University!"</span></p></div>
