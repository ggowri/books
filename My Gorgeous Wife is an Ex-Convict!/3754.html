        <h1>Chapter 3752</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing to worry about. The driver who came to pick up Veronica's friend is Mason from the Reed family, and he and Veronica have been childhood sweethearts," the department head said. This was also what the principal had told him on the phone just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" The homeroom teacher's face turned pale. "The Reed family's Mason?" Was it the same Mason he was thinking of?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's the Reed Group's the Reed family Mason," the department head said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a gasp in the office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have thought that an ordinary student who needed to work part-time would have a relationship with Mason, the richest family in Emerald City, and even a childhood sweetheart relationship at that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anyway, let's stop here. As for the rumors in the school, we should clear them out and delete all the related posts and comments on the school forum!" said the head of the department.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, no one spoke up to refute, and the homeroom teacher's face had become extremely ugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was the one who had been the most difficult for Veronica just now, and he </span><span>offended Veronica not just for the school's reputation, but also because he received a favor from Vanessa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa's family had said that if he could help Vanessa get rid of this trouble, they would cooperate with him on a project.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To say that he would participate in the project was almost the same as receiving money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he didn't even know if he could continue to stay in this school, let alone money!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa felt relieved when she heard that Veronica had been called into the office, and she was looking forward to seeing Veronica's face when she was expelled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How dare Veronica treat her like that! She would make Veronica know how powerful she was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shirley was nervously waiting downstairs, watching for her friend to come out, afraid that her friend would really be expelled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Shirley, what are you doing here? Are you worried that Veronica will be expelled?" Vanessa walked over and said, followed by her group of girlfriends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Vanessa, what are you doing here?" Shirley frowned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I'm here to see what expression Veronica will have on her face when she's expelled." Vanessa said, eager to see Veronica's grieving face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all classmates, why do you have to be like this?" Shirley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She's a person who ruins the school's atmosphere. What qualifications does she have to be our classmate? She's definitely getting expelled today!" Vanessa said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa's group of friends began to criticize Veronica one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shirley only had one voice, how could she compete with so many others?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Shirley was about to roll up her sleeves in anger, she suddenly saw Veronica walking down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica!" Shirley hurriedly greeted her, "What happened? Did the school leaders talk to you about the rumors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They asked me about the rumors and then the department head said that the matter ends here, and then let me leave," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just like that?" Shirley was surprised, "They didn't make you drop out of school?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shirley breathed a sigh of relief. It was good that Veronica didn't drop out of school. Since the department head said it ends here, they probably won't pursue the matter any further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's have a good meal later to celebrate!" Shirley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Veronica smiled and agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa, who had been prepared to see Veronica crying, was now surprised and said, "Impossible! How could you not have been expelled?! You must be pretending! The school leaders clearly wanted you to drop out!"</span></p></div>
