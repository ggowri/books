        <h1>Chapter 458</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fine, he was her creditor anyway!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace and Jason returned to Reed Residence, Jason asked, "Are you disappointed today? We went to S City but didn't find anything useful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. "No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not disappointed?" He seemed somewhat surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because you're willing to help me find clues and clear my name. I'm happy regardless if we find something useful or not," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he really trusted her, and the original estrangement between them was slowly disappearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her. He understood her desire to reverse the case, only... He could clear her name, but he could not tell her the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though it was a truth she wanted to know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As long as you're happy." He smiled slightly and sidestepped the topic by saying, "What are you going to do the next few days if you're not going to work?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm going to visit Grandma in a couple of days," she said. She was so busy with her work that she did not have time to call her grandmother to check on her. Since it was rare for her to have these days off, it was natural for her to visit her grandmother. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, when are you going? I'll go with you," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You? You want to visit my grandmother too?" She was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's your grandmother. Of course, I'm going to visit her," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such a simple sentence left Grace with a bit of a sore nose for no reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, then we'll go together," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, the traditional medicine from the hospital arrived. It was to help Grace with her uterus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the traditional medicine and felt a touch of emotion. If Jason had not taken her for a physical examination, she might still think that she would never have a child of her own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The medicine seemed to give her hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, about 20 minutes after dinner, Jason asked the servant to bring the heated traditional medicine over. Along with the traditional medicine came a plate of candies and chocolates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The medicine is a little bitter. You should take some candy or chocolate after the medicine to get rid of the bitter taste in your mouth," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," she answered, realizing the amount of care he was putting in for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the bowl and drank all the traditional medicine in one gulp, causing her eyebrows to frown. It was&hellip; extremely bitter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she picked up a piece of candy and put it in her mouth to wipe out the bitter taste.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it bitter?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. Then, she saw Jason picking up the bowl she had just drunk the medicine with. It still contained some leftover traditional medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could ask him what he was going to do with it, she saw him lift the bowl and tilt his head slightly before drinking the rest of the traditional medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. "Why did you drink it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because I want to know how bitter your medicine is," he answered. He seemed to savor the taste of the traditional medicine in his mouth. "It's indeed bitter."</p></div>
