        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she sat in the basket, it started moving slowly towards this side of the river after a moment. The basket on the other side of the river also began to move towards here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the two baskets met in the air, Whitney did as she had promised and pressed the pause button, causing both baskets to come to a halt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at the tiny baby in the basket, who was none other than Jasmine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And Jasmine is currently crying loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda quickly leaned over and picked up Jasmine from the hanging basket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, it's time for you to tell me your withdrawal password," urged Whitney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda then gave out the password, which had been discussed with everyone before departure. As soon as she received Jasmine, she could tell her the password to ease her psychological state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, the police will naturally react and take her and Jasmine to safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After receiving the password, Whitney hung up the phone. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was holding Jasmine and trying to soothe the child to stop crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, I don't know if it's because I'm hungry or for some other reason, but the baby keeps crying and there's no sign of stopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not long after, the phone rang again, but this time it was Phoebe calling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, thank you so much for bringing us the password. If we have good days ahead, we'll definitely have to thank you properly. However... it also depends on whether you have the luck to survive," Phoebe said with a sinister tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's heart sank. As she suspected, it wasn't going to be that easy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So what she needs to do now is to try to delay as much as possible. This way, Brian and the police can have a better chance of finding her location and rescuing her and Jasmine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've already received the money, why go to such extremes? If you just take the money and leave now, this matter will be over. But if Jasmine and I don't survive, do you really think the Reed family and Brian will let you go?" Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hahaha..." Phoebe laughed, "I never said that both you and that child will die. Only one of you will die."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda frowned, "Dead... only one?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What does this mean?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But before she could think further, there was a sudden explosion and the rope she was on started shaking violently. Then, the basket became detached and could potentially fall into the river at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side, the rope began to move slowly, and the basket hanging from it started to sway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, the hook on one side of Valda's basket has completely come off, leaving her with only one hand to hold onto the basket while the other hand is holding her child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda!" Brian's voice came from the shore. Valda looked towards the shore and saw Brian with the police, who were preparing to rescue someone in the river.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, don't be afraid. Just hold on a little longer, help will be here soon!" Brian said urgently, his face filled with worry and anxiety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda responded, as long as she could hold on a little longer, she and Jasmine would be saved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, as the police officer was about to dive into the water, his expression suddenly changed and he looked upstream along the river.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda also heard the sound that was rushing towards them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That is... the sound of water!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It's the sound of a lot of water rushing out!</p></div>
