        <h1>Chapter 1526</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Just what? Are you going to say that you came back because you love me?" Jason said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stared fixedly at the person in front of her. His tears made her heart ache. She did not understand why his attitude toward her seemed to have an indescribable contradiction, but... "Yes, I came back for you because I love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His pupils shrank, and his heart beat wildly as if what she said was very important to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His heart was even beating so fast that he was a little out of breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why does this woman influence me so much?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you think I'd believe someone who's been gone for five years?" It was a long time before he managed to speak with some difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What will it take to convince you?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He pursed his thin lips, and he did not know what to say for a moment. Almost unconsciously, his fingers squeezed her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Ouch!" Grace could not help but frown and let out a low cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason instinctively loosened his fingers, and Grace pulled out her wrist. Sure enough, her wrist was already red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked at his empty palm a little blankly as if a treasure had left his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Treasure? What's my treasure?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;Could it be her?' He only found it a little funny when the thought flashed across his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, a pair of hands grabbed his face. "Why are you crying? Don't cry. You're crying as if I bullied you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Bully? Who is she to bully me?' Jason thought sarcastically, but he could not control these tears at all. It was his body&rsquo;s instinctive reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"As for proof..." she muttered before her lips touched his cheek and she gently kissed his tears away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason subconsciously tried to push her away, but when his hand pressed on her shoulder, he seemed unwilling to push her away and could not muster any strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She slowly kissed his eyes that were full of tears. "Okay. Okay, stop crying. I didn't mean to leave you for five years. I won't leave you anymore, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her voice rang softly in the car. Her gentle tone was so melodious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Feeling somewhat uncomfortable, he wanted to hide his face. 'Does she think I'm a child that she needs to coax?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With her hands on his cheeks, she turned his face toward her as soon as his face moved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Jason glared at the woman in front of him. No one dared to do this to him, only her... However, he did not dislike what she was doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If... Uh, you can push me away if you don&rsquo;t like me doing this," said Grace. After all, she loved him as much as ever, but he seemed to feel somewhat differently for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Maybe some things will change in five years...' Even though she thought so, there seemed to be a voice in her heart saying, 'It won't change. His feelings for me won't change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;They&rsquo;re so unforgettable. How could they change in just five years?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, when Grace said this, she nervously watched his reaction, afraid that he would push her away.</p></div>
