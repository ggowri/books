        <h1>Chapter 3677</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been too long, so you just had to see me?" Mason sneered. "But I don't want to see you at all. You should understand that you're not my Veronica anymore. We have no relationship between us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's face turned pale, and her hands hanging at her side anxiously tugged at her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, she knew that they had no relationship anymore... but she always remembered the past between them, the misunderstandings she had of him, and the attachment he had for her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I understand now. I'll be more careful in the future," Veronica said with difficulty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Good that you understand. Don't appear in front of me again," Mason said before turning and leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica hung her head, holding back the tears that threatened to spill. Yes, she </span><span>understood. His attitude today made her realize once again that he had truly hypnotized away the feelings from their past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she still remembered everything from their past, those feelings were no longer there!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, she was already someone completely unrelated!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica left desolately, not noticing the two figures hiding nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper didn't expect to come out looking for Mason and stumble upon this scene. And she certainly didn't expect Roger to suddenly appear by her side and witness it with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that the Reed family is really cold-hearted. Even though you were once so close, you can still heartlessly cast someone aside when they're no longer useful," Roger said mockingly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he didn't spend much time with the Reed family and only saw Mason and Veronica a few times, he knew that they had a good relationship. Mason even lived with the Barlow family because of Veronica, not the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't understand anything, so why make comments?" Jasper retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then tell me, is there some hidden story behind this?" Roger asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pursed her lips and didn't explain. After all, this was between Veronica and Mason. "It's not my place to say, and you don't need to know anything."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger's sarcasm grew stronger. "Of course, you're the high and mighty Reed family. Why would us ordinary people need to know about your family affairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not what I meant! This is between Mason and Veronica!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think I need to hear your explanation. People like you rich folks play with other people's feelings so easily, it's only natural, isn't it?" Roger said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You--" Jasper glared at the other person and suddenly said, "Do you think Mason played with Veronica's feelings? Or do you think I played with your feelings?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger's lips curled up slightly, as if he was agreeing with her statement.</span></p></div>
