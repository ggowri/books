        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina suddenly froze.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The name Kit, she had been deliberately trying not to think about it during this time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because every time she thought about it, it would cause her immense pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made her feel torn apart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to see Kit as the only person she could rely on, but in the end, she discovered that it was a huge lie!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his kindness towards her was genuine.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He rescued her from the village, cared for her, and even saved her during the car accident!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his deception made it difficult for her to let go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the accident hadn't happened, would she have lived her whole life under that lie as long as she didn't recover her memory, not even knowing that her parents were still alive?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wouldn't know who the true father of her child in her belly was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her entire early life had been woven by Kit's lies.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought that this name would gradually fade away with time.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, she had indeed been trying to do that.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never expected to hear news about him here.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Disabled?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He, who was once an idol star shining on the stage, had become disabled?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because of that car accident?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because he saved her that he became disabled?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's mind was a mess.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she walked out of the restroom and returned to her seat in the restaurant, Tina's mind was still occupied with thoughts of Kit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with you? Your face looks so awful. Are you feeling unwell?" Chandler asked with concern.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina replied reluctantly, "I suddenly feel a bit tired and want to go home and rest."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I'll take you back after dinner. Your body is still in the recovery period, so you really shouldn't overexert yourself," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina nodded absentmindedly, lowered her head, and continued eating her food, unaware that Chandler's gaze toward her had changed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing their meal, Chandler accompanied Tina back to the Stephenson family's house. When Tina was about to enter the front door, Chandler suddenly hugged her. "No matter what troubles you have, you can confide in me. I'll do everything I can to help you solve them."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you suddenly saying this?" Tina said uncomfortably.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just don't want you to have any worries," he said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina paused for a moment, her head resting against his chest, feeling enveloped in warmth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," she whispered softly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her troubles were something he couldn't solve!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying goodbye to Chandler, Tina went back to her bedroom and opened her phone, searching for news about Kit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, in no time, news about Kit's disability caught her eye.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that Kit now lived alone in an apartment he had bought in Stasas, with one hand disabled and weak muscles.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people had seen pictures of Kit going to the hospital for rehabilitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the person in the pictures was wearing a fisherman's hat and a mask, covering themselves up completely.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Tina could still recognize Kit at a glance in the pictures!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were several pictures where one of his hands could move, but the other hand just hung by his side, unless a healthcare professional helped him lift his arm, it would just hang there.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did his hand really become disabled?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina stared blankly at the pictures on her phone, a pain that was hard to put into words surged up.</span></p></div>
