        <h1>Chapter 735</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her silence seemed to allow Brian to confirm his speculation further. "Therefore, have you really forgotten something? Does it have to do with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip slightly. "Mr. Hart, you have an overactive imagination. I did come here today for hypnosis, but not because of the reason you&rsquo;ve mentioned. It's to treat some of my other symptoms. As you know, I was in prison for three years before, so I have some anxiety disorder or something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His phoenix eyes were fixed on her as if to distinguish the truth from falsehood in her words. "Is that so? Anxiety disorders? Do you have them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She met his eyes. "How do you know I don't?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly moved closer to her, his elegant and handsome face inching closer to her eyes. "Did you know that when you grabbed my hand at the fair that day, you said the same things as the little girl who saved me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I told you. It was nonsense," she said without flinching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nonsense?" he sneered, "You grabbed my hand and said you won't let go, that you're going to take me up and want me to hold your hand tight! Tell me, what nonsense does it take to speak so illogically? Also, take me up? Where are you taking me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His question struck her in the heart like a heavy hammer, inexplicably making her feel a tightness in her chest. It was almost as if she could not breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he approached, it made her step back until her back was against the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She unconsciously raised her hand to block the space between them, but his hand pressed both her hands against the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, what are you doing? Let go!" Grace struggled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her strength was not enough for her to break away from Brian's grip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, is it so hard for you to admit that you saved me?" He growled at her. As the crown prince of the entertainment industry, he was often fawned upon and ingratiated. When had he ever cried in such an aggrieved voice in front of a woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at the man blankly. As he drew near, she saw his face. His phoenix eyes had a touch of redness, and they were staring back at her as if she had done something heinous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were so aggrieved as if he was an abandoned child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Grace just felt her chest tighten as the memory of him crying in front of her came back to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They all said that the crown prince of the entertainment industry kept changing girlfriends, but they were all substitutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crown prince was always looking at a small silver bracelet and was always looking for someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then... It became an obsession.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her wrists were captured, and the slight pain was pulling her back to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she was the person she used to be, she would try her best to find out the truth. She would want to know whether she had lost her memories and whether she had saved Brian when she was a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Now, she did not want to find out the truth. Finding out the truth would make her get entangled with Brian and make Jason sensitive and uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If that was the case, she would rather have it buried forever and never probe into it&ndash;Regardless if&hellip; It was her or not.</p></div>
