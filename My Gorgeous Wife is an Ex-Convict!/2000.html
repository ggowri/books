        <h1>Chapter 1998</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Monica Keller and the rest of Keller Group also sat in their chairs with pale faces. The meeting was now a struggle for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson gained a complete victory in this battle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After the meeting, in the president&rsquo;s office of Stephenson Group, Hadwin Stephenson looked at his mother and said with a straight face, "I'll arrange a plane for you to go abroad tomorrow. You&rsquo;ll stay abroad for a few years before coming back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers sneered. "I won't go abroad. What's the matter? Are you going to lock me up again? You&rsquo;re going to lock up your own mother? Locking people up is illegal, you know. Aren't you afraid I'll sue you if you do that? It&rsquo;ll be another scandal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said indifferently, "I'm not planning on locking you up. I can only tell you all the shares you have in your hands will become a waste if you refuse to go abroad. As for your real estate, they might be under your name, but you're not the one who paid for them. I have a way to take them back. The longer you stay here, the more assets you&rsquo;ll lose."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers's expression changed. "Do you really want to go that far?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You started it first. I wanted to let you off the hook again and again, but you kept refusing to let me off the hook," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Since when have I not let you off the hook? I just don't want you to be with a woman like Lina. What is it about her that's good enough for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So you forced Anthony Sherman to post something and make it go viral. How are you not forcing me when you're treating Lina like that?" said Hadwin Stephenson as he approached Emily Flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers staggered back a step, her face turning pale. Her eyes were full of shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson suddenly chuckled. "What's the matter? Are you surprised how I found out? You paid Anthony Sherman a sum of money not to return to the country for a year, so you thought everything was perfect, didn&rsquo;t you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers was so shocked that she could not say a word. It turned out her son already knew everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So you see, I'm already showing mercy by letting you go abroad. If you're still in J City after tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll assume that you want to go against me and I won't show mercy anymore," Hadwin Stephenson said grimly as if it was the last warning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers trembled and suddenly snapped. "You're doing all this for Lina, aren&rsquo;t you? Why are you doing this to me for her? Who is she to have you do this for her? I'm the one who gave birth to you and raised you. Who is this woman to have you act like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Just because she has always only thought of me as just Hadwin Stephenson. I'm just Hadwin Stephenson to her, not the heir of the Stephenson family or the head of the Stephenson family. She would... never use me!" replied Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If he had never met Lina, he would never know that someone would love him so purely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She won't use you? When did you become so naive? She came to you after getting pregnant. She's just trying to use the baby to get to the top. I know what a woman like her is thinking. You're just a tool for her to get to the top!" Emily Flowers said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Hadwin Stephenson only looked at her coldly, not in the least affected by what she said. "So you&rsquo;ll never be someone like her. I love her. She's more important to me than my own life. If you're still going to go after her, then I don't mind killing my own mother!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers was stunned as she felt chills rising up her spine.</p></div>
