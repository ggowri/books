        <h1>Chapter 4413: Demanding</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley shivered. Is Calvert just outside?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she rushed out of the room, she didn't see Calvert outside. It was as if he had never been there at all.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was in a rush to find Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had barely taken a step when Lornell grabbed her. "Don't you think it's better if he heard our conversation just now? He was only a tool to begin with, and he has already completed his task."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who said he's just a tool!" Harley looked at Lornell and said, "I never intended to use him to provoke you or anything. I never thought about starting over with you. For me, what's in the past is in the past. Lornell, I did really like you in the past, and I wanted to spend my life with you. But now, the person I like is Calvert. It's because I like him that I decided to date him!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's face turned sour, "Are you really going with him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" she said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if he's not worthy of you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doesn't match me? Are you talking about family background? If we put that aside and just consider me as an individual, then what makes him unworthy? Moreover, in my eyes, he's more ambitious, more hardworking, and better at seizing the opportunities that fate offers. He's someone who's willing to change his destiny!" Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, that's why she was attracted to Calvert, huh!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lornell, don't waste any feelings on me. I wish you can find someone who truly loves you!" After saying this, Harley left without looking back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell gave a bitter smile, feeling as if his heart had sunk into an unfathomable abyss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can he really find the person he loves again?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or perhaps, is it possible to never fall in love with anyone else for the rest of one's life?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert felt like everything was just a dream.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was so sweet before, but now, all he desperately wants is to escape from it all!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it really as Lornell said, that he's just a tool to stir up emotions?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If that's true, then he...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like in an instant, everything had turned gloomy!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Son, I've been waiting for you!" Just as Calvert returned to his apartment, he was unexpectedly greeted at the door by his gambling-addict father.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face suddenly changed, "How did you end up here?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I came to see you!" Lornell's father said, "You're doing well for yourself now. I saw the news report, you're dating that girl from the Hart family. If you can marry her in the future, the entire Hart family will practically be ours!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, Lornell's father has already instinctively started to consider the Hart family as his own property!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert looked at his father with disgust, "What on earth are you talking about!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, alright, let's just say I'm talking nonsense. I'm a bit strapped for cash lately, and you seem to be doing pretty well. How about helping me out with a million or two?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's father talked about a couple of million as if it was pocket change, something he could easily whip out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't give it to you!" Calvert immediately refused.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he had the money, he wouldn't give it to his father. He knew all too well that his father would just gamble it away. It would be like throwing money into a bottomless pit, and his father would just keep asking for more in the future!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not giving? You, a big star, making so much money, and you can't even spare a bit for your own father, do you even have a conscience!" Lornell's father cursed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You better leave now, or I'll call the cops!" Calvert warned.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Call the police? Are you planning to make a spectacle of us, father and son, for everyone to see? Aren't you afraid that the Hart family will find it embarrassing and forbid you from seeing Harley?" said Lornell's father.</span></p></div>
