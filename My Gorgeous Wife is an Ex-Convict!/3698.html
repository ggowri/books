        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even she was surprised that she couldn't grab his arm. She had felt like she had him, but she didn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your suit..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is my unwanted trash. What's the point of returning trash to me?" Jasper said coldly, finally looking directly at her as Angelica had hoped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his gaze made Angelica's heart skip a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because his eyes were too cold and sharp, as if he could see through all her intentions, even...making her feel like he was calling her trash, not just the suit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica forced a dry smile. "Veronica, my assistant, found this suit. I didn't know you had thrown it away. I wanted to help her out since she's so busy with work and school. I also wanted to apologize for last time when I accidentally spilled pasta on your clothes..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She shifted all the blame onto Veronica, making herself look both innocent and wronged.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's gaze darkened at the mention of Veronica's name.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The air around them suddenly felt suffocating. Just as Angelica thought Mason wasn't going to say anything, his thin lips parted and he asked, "Is she your assistant?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, yes...she is," Angelica quickly replied. "Actually, I used to have another assistant, but she was just a temporary worker. Recently, my other assistant had to take a leave of absence due to illness, and I heard that Veronica was working part-time to support herself. I thought she deserved a chance, so I let her be my temporary assistant. This way, she could earn more money than just doing odd jobs."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica continued to portray herself as a kind-hearted person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason spoke coldly, "Since she was the one who picked up the clothes, she should be the one to return them to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Jasper left on his own.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica stood there in a daze, watching Mason's back. She felt a lump in her throat and couldn't breathe properly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was this supposed to mean?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he want Veronica to return the clothes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica had thought that even though Mason seemed cold, she could still strike up a conversation with him while returning the clothes. But it turned out like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like she was just a clown from beginning to end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Veronica looked at the suit that was thrown in front of her and hesitated. "Miss Kinsman, what is this for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This suit. Mason said it was garbage and didn't want it. Since you picked up the garbage, you should return it to him personally!" Angelica said unkindly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica lowered her gaze and felt a bitter taste in her mouth. Garbage? He thought it was garbage because it was the suit that had protected her from the pasta. In his eyes, </span><span>she wasn't worth that kind of gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you staring at! Listen carefully, you will return this suit to Mason and explain the situation from last time. It was your fault that I got angry and threw pasta, don't let Mason misunderstand me, got it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's eyes dimmed, "I understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, you can leave now," Angelica said.</span></p></div>
