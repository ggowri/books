        <h1>Chapter 2237</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was still grabbing his collar, and Mr. Lambert naturally recognized Grace, so he immediately said that. After all, he would really be finished if he also offended the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he could only continue to throw mud at Kyla so that the Reed family would vent their anger on Kyla instead. That way, he would be able to keep himself out of it. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what Martin Weiss said made Mr. Lambert lose his last glimmer of hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla is my wife! She&rsquo;s the only wife I'll ever have. Who are you to judge her? You'll pay for every word you said today!" Martin Weiss suddenly threw Mr. Lambert on the ground and looked condescendingly at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert shivered, unable to believe what he had heard!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla is... Martin Weiss's wife! They're already... married?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Martin Weiss even said Kyla is the only wife he'll ever have in front of so many people!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he learned from Jacqueline Bowman that Kyla only had a shabby store and lived in the house behind it. How did she become Martin Weiss's wife?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter what the real reason was, Mr. Lambert knew he was done for, and so was the Lambert family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman, who was standing not far away, was even more shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla is... Martin Weiss's wife? She&rsquo;s not his hidden lover?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;How could it be? How could Martin Weiss marry a woman who has been to prison? Although Kyla was wrongly convicted, it's an indisputable fact that she was in prison for more than three years!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Kyla who was standing beside Martin Weiss and being carefully protected by him, Jacqueline Bowman felt a fit of deep jealousy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were both ex-convicts, but why was Kyla able to marry Martin Weiss while she could not even get a title from someone like Neal Reid?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems your friend is no ordinary person!" Neal Reid's voice rang in Jacqueline Bowman's ears. "I didn't expect her to be Martin Weiss's legitimate wife. Didn't you claim to have a good relationship with her and that you helped her out a lot in prison? What's the matter? Did she never even mention that to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was embarrassed. She thought she knew everything about Kyla but in the end... Kyla had kept the greatest secret from her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had been waiting to see her make a fool of herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Jacqueline Bowman was the one who said what Mr. Lambert had said today, she would be the one greatly humiliated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid said, "You'd better maintain a good relationship with this friend of yours. Whether the Hunter family can be friends with the Weiss family depends on how close you are! If the Hunter family can get on the Weiss family's good side, then you'll have much to gain. Don't let me down again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman shuddered. Looking at the man beside her, she suddenly felt an intense reluctance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this all I can get? I'm no worse than Kyla. I'm even younger and prettier than her, but why are our fates so different?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it," Jacqueline Bowman looked down and replied obediently.</p></div>
