        <h1>Chapter 3653</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am Lawrence, so what?" He smiled and admitted it frankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why did you conceal your identity? Why didn't you admit it when I asked you before?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I have to admit it because there is a legal requirement?" He walked slowly to her, his lips smiling but his eyes coldly looking at her, "I am now Roger, and as for the former Lawrence, he died in the hands of debt collectors. Before he died, he was still thinking about why the high and mighty Miss Reed family didn't answer his calls. If she hadn't broken off with him back then, would everything be different now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's body stiffened, her eyes red as she looked at him, "You hate me, don't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are the high and mighty Grand Princess of the Reed family. How dare I hate you. At that time, I was just a toy for you to play with when you were bored. When you got tired of it and didn't find it interesting anymore, you naturally kicked the toy away." But he took it seriously, thinking that toys could also be friends of princesses, thinking that she was the one who was really good to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are not a toy! I have never treated you as a toy!" Jasper retorted loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what am I if I am not a toy?" Roger asked back, "You can break off with me so decisively, not listen to any of my explanations, and then ignore me, even unwilling to answer my calls. Do you know what kind of feelings I had when I made that call back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry!" Jasper choked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had thought about what Lawrence would say to her if she saw him again. Even at this moment, she had imagined these words in her mind more than once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she really heard them, it was so painful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry?" He sneered, "At this point, what's the use of your apology? Can your apology bring my parents back to life? Can it turn back time? Can it..." His voice paused, and the rest of his words were swallowed back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is there any way to make him not experience that kind of hellish torture?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back to when he was kidnapped from the hospital and everything he went through afterwards, even worse than an animal, that was the darkest moment he had ever experienced. It was then that he realized that there really was a hell on earth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you can't do it, how can you expect me to forgive you?" Roger said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lawrence, I know I shouldn't have cut ties with you back then, shouldn't have missed your phone call. I've been looking for you all these years. I don't know how to make it up to you, but...at least, at least I know that you're still alive..." She sobbed, tears the size of beans rolling down her cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger looked at her tear-streaked face, his eyes full of mockery. "You know I'm still alive, so you think your own guilt can be reduced, right? People like you, how could you care about the lives of ordinary people?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not it!" Jasper said. "I feel guilty about what happened to you, but not to reduce my own guilt. I just don't want you to die, don't want you to disappear from this world. Because Lawrence is an important person to me! Very important, very important!"</span></p></div>
