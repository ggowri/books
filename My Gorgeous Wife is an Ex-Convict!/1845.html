        <h1>Chapter 1843</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A meaningful glint flickered in Katherine Jackson's eyes. These so-called banquets held by socialites were, to put it bluntly, blind date banquets held by the high society. If it were in the past, Hadwin Stephenson would never attend this sort of banquets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Did it mean Hadwin Stephenson had gotten over Lina, which was why he was attending them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After lifting the blood curse, Hadwin Stephenson gave the Jackson family a good price and acquired their properties as they had agreed. However, the money could hardly make up for Katherine Jackson's reluctance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had lost her glory, and it was all only because Hadwin Stephenson wanted to avenge Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Frankly speaking, she ended up where she was now because of Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina had Hadwin Stephenson protecting her before this, so she dared not touch her. However, since Hadwin Stephenson had left Lina, she wanted Lina to pay the price!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A slight smile appeared on the corners of Katherine Jackson's lips. Then, she thought of how she had met Lina's eyes when she was driving past her car that was parked outside the mansion that morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It seems that Lina has misunderstood the situation!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'So what if Hadwin Stephenson loved Lina deeply and suffered so much for her? It still can&rsquo;t beat a misunderstanding.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts and Mrs. Watts finally decided to have the operation in Emerald City. Grace helped contact the hospital where she had the operation last time. Dr. Russell had worked with those specialists before, so everything went more smoothly this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, Mrs. Watts's operation was much simpler than Grace's. It took about three hours before she was pushed out of the operating room. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Mrs. Watts woke up from anesthesia and saw Mick Reed, Jasper Reed, and Grace in the ward, a faint trace of disappointment flickered in her eyes. "Where's Jason? He... He..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts spoke but stopped mid-sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay has something to do at work, so he didn't come. I'll bring him to see you later, Mrs. Watts," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks. Don't bother. I... I just asked because I didn&rsquo;t see him. He must be busy running such a large company," Mrs. Watts said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After that, Mrs. Watts had a few words with the two young ones and got a little tired, so Grace said, "Mrs. Watts, get some rest. I'll visit you again tomorrow. Just call me if you need anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," answered Mrs. Watts. Just as Grace was turning around, she suddenly said, "Thank you, Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't mention it." Grace smiled and led her two children away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts stared blankly at Grace's back. She was not thanking her for the operation but was referring to her staying by Jason's side, giving him a real home and three adorable children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As a mother, she had only caused her son pain. Fortunately, Grace had healed him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts sighed gently and said to his wife, "Don't overthink it. If you really want to see Jason... I'll just tell Grace to try and bring Jason to the hospital to visit you more often."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts hurriedly said, "Don't... I don't deserve to have him visit me. Besides... I'm afraid I'll give myself away in his presence."</p></div>
