        <h1>Chapter 1299</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Daddy and I will give you a warm home!" Grace lowered her head and spoke gently to her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea what was the sex of the three babies in her belly and what they would look like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she looked forward to all three of them coming out safe and sound!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the next few days, Grace was only focused on Kyla Corbyn's custody case. Jason had also found her a lawyer who was an expert in this field. They often handled custody cases and had a high winning rate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had also discussed the case with them several times. Even though the lawyer was experienced, they were only 20% sure of the case. In other words, the chances of losing the case were 80%.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there no other way to increase our chances?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Unless we can prove that her case was a wrongful conviction," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace also knew the crux of the problem, so she said, "Okay, I'll think of something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps their only breakthrough so far was the doctor who performed the abortion after Paisley Daniels fell down the stairs!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Paisley Daniels was discharged from the hospital and Kyla Corbyn was imprisoned, the doctor resigned from the hospital shortly afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason came to pick Grace up when it was time to get off work. Grace asked, "Jay, can you help me find someone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The attending doctor who performed the abortion on Paisley Daniels," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly. "You want to prove that Kyla Corbyn was framed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's the only lead we have. The attending doctor knows all the details, and my bet is... Paisley Daniels wasn't pregnant at the time. It was a fake abortion, or the child she was carrying wasn't Martin Weiss's!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were either of these two, it would be enough to prove that Paisley Daniels had an agenda when she fell down the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Paisley Daniels was unfortunately pregnant with Martin Weiss's child... then she would be wrong and it would be harder for Kyla to reverse her case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't you afraid that it&rsquo;ll be confirmed Paisley Daniels was indeed carrying Martin Weiss's child?" Sure enough, Jason hit the nail on the head and pointed out the key issue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But what if Kyla was indeed set up by Paisley Daniels? No one knew that Kyla was pregnant at the time, so if Paisley Daniels was really pregnant with Martin Weiss's child, there was no need for her to miscarry to frame Kyla. Isn't such a price too high?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave her analysis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "And what if we find this attending doctor but he refuses to say anything? What's more, even if the attending doctor is willing to speak up, some of the physical evidence is already gone. Paisley Daniels could deny all of it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I'm not trying to convince the judge that Kyla is innocent. I'm just trying to convince Martin Weiss! If Martin Weiss loved Kyla before, I bet he doesn't know the truth about Paisley Daniels's set-up. He just believed what he saw and believed Paisley Daniels. That's why he gave such a testimony."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So do you think as long as Martin Weiss is a little convinced and starts having doubts in his heart, he won't fight for custody with Kyla Corbyn?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"At least that's the only thing we can do for now," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a smile at the corners of his lips as he watched her analyze the situation. It seemed to him that her entire body was glowing, and she looked so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so beautiful that he could not look away.</p></div>
