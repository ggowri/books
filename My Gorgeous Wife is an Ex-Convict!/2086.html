        <h1>Chapter 2084</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "She's not feeling well and has gone home first. What about you? How are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm fine. Everything is normal, but the doctor still told me to pay attention to the baby's kicking. I have to come to the hospital immediately if the baby is suddenly kicking unusually again," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then you have to be careful. Why don't I send you home?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sure," Lina answered. After a while, she said, "Oh, I wonder what's wrong with Kyla. She didn't seem well this noon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could not make any comment. After all, it was only her speculation, and Kyla had not done any tests either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace told Jason about Kyla's possible pregnancy in the evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If Kyla is indeed pregnant, what do you think will happen to her relationship with Martin Weiss?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason smiled faintly. "I can't say for sure. But judging from Kyla's previous attitude toward Martin Weiss, I'm afraid she won't get together with Martin Weiss just because of a child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If it were true that they could get together because of a child, Kyla would have gotten together with Martin Weiss because of Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But if Kyla really doesn't want to be with Martin Weiss and she's indeed pregnant, will Martin Weiss want everything to go on as usual? Or... will he do anything to get Kyla?" Grace said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It makes sense if Martin Weiss does anything. If it were me, I would too," Jason said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze and looked at Jason. "You would too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I would." He looked straight at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She suddenly recalled what had happened. "When... I was pregnant&hellip; If I had refused to marry you, would you... have done anything to force me to marry you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's eyes glimmered slightly as he gently took Grace's hand and said, "Would you hate me if I said yes?" Perhaps he could follow her thinking and tell a lie that would please her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he did not want to do so. He had promised to be honest with her and would no longer hide things from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked blankly at Jason. Although she did not like people &lsquo;doing something&rsquo; to her to get what they wanted, there was no way she could hate it when that person was Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She shook her head and could not help asking, "What would you do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Do you want to guess what Martin Weiss would do from my answer?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"..." Grace said nothing as if she was saying yes tacitly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If it were me, I would grab your weakest point. I&rsquo;d just hold on to anything you can't afford to lose and the things you value the most," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His elegant voice sounded like a violin, but it made Grace tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What he said was lethal, just like his usual style. It was why many would warn others not to mess with Jason in Emerald City, or you would not even know how you died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you still refused, then... maybe I'd keep you with me for the rest of my life, or..." He paused as his gorgeous peach blossom eyes looked at her gently. &ldquo;I'd let you leave and drive myself insane."</p></div>
