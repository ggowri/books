        <h1>Chapter 4188 What are you to me?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Kit drove away from the scene with Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Along the way, Tina sat in the passenger seat, her head down, feeling restless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit occasionally glanced at Tina from the corner of his eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though it had been over half a year since she disappeared after falling into the water, Emerald City was still searching for her. However, everyone had already lost hope, hoping only to find her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Stephenson family had even prepared a grave for her, but they hadn't put her name on the tombstone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps there was still a trace of hope deep in their hearts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he never imagined that he would find her faster than the Hunter family and the Stephenson family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because the Hunter family and the Stephenson family were mainly searching for Tina's whereabouts in Emerald City and the surrounding counties and cities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So he deliberately stayed away from those areas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After he left the entertainment industry, he simply followed the waterway where Tina disappeared and drove downstream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, he had only heard that there was a ritual in the village where Tina escaped tonight, so he wanted to go and take a look. He didn't expect to encounter Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was like... it was arranged by fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit took Tina to a small town dozens of miles away and checked into a small hotel in the town.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina looked up and met Kit's concerned eyes. "Tha... thank you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit led Tina into the hotel room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a double room, but quite spacious. Besides the two beds, there was a small sitting area with a sofa and a coffee table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Tina's uneasy expression, Kit explained, "You can sleep inside. You can choose any of the two beds. I'll sleep on the sofa. The reason I didn't book two rooms is because you're pregnant, and I'm worried about any unforeseen circumstances. If I were in another room, I wouldn't be able to know. So... it's just for your safety."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina looked up and stared at the person in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her anxious heart was calmed by his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This man was the one who brought her out of the village, the one who saved her. And for some reason, he gave her a familiar feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, when this man got off the car, he called her Tina, so... "Do we know each other?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Kit was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do we know each other?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... don't know me?" Kit widened his eyes and looked at Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina bit her lip. "I... lost my memory. I don't remember anything from before. Because I was saved by the Drogo family, everyone in the village says I'm Drogo's wife. But... I know, I'm not Drogo's wife at all, and the child in my belly is not his!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit looked at Tina in shock. She lost her memory... she actually lost her memory!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't remember anything from before?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah." Tina nodded. "Every time I try to remember things from before, I get a headache."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... are called Tina!" Kit murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina, was that her name? Tina wondered to herself. "And what about you? What's your name?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... I'm called Kit," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then what relation do you have with me?" Her memory was a blank slate, and right now she seemed like a naive child, asking him.</p></div>
