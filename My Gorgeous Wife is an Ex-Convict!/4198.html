        <h1>Chapter 4196</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle of the night, Tina was awakened by a nightmare!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat up, still a bit dazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" Kit rushed into Tina's room after hearing the commotion and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just had a nightmare," Tina replied softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A nightmare?" Kit asked worriedly, "What kind of nightmare?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he turned on the bedside lamp and gently wiped the sweat from Tina's forehead with a tissue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I dreamt of a man," Tina said, unaware that Kit's hand suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of man did you dream of?" Kit struggled to control his trembling voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I couldn't see the man's face clearly, but he seemed to be in pain, writhing on the ground. I wanted to help him." Tina said, feeling scared in the dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if the man would die if she didn't approach and help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how she tried to step forward, she couldn't get any closer to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And then she woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Kit felt a sense of relief. Should he be grateful? Thankful that Tina didn't see the man's face in her dream!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop thinking about it, it was just a dream," Kit said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, just a dream," Tina whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, go back to sleep," Kit said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina suddenly grabbed his hand, "Can you stay with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit was taken aback, looking at Tina absentmindedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina immediately added, as if wanting to explain, "I'm still a bit scared. If you stay with me, maybe I can fall asleep faster."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Kit said softly, staying by the bedside.</span></p></div>
