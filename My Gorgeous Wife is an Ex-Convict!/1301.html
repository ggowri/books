        <h1>Chapter 1300</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace finished analyzing the situation, she found Jason staring intently at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... are you looking at?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just think you're beautiful," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart was beating fast again. 'When did he become such a sweet talker and such a flirt? He's the beautiful one, alright?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, any news from Hadwin Stephenson?" Grace asked after calming herself down. Lina was going to have her second operation in two days. The doctor also said Lina would wake up if everything went well after the operation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How awful would Lina feel if she woke up and Hadwin Stephenson was still missing? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "Not yet. The Stephenson family isn&rsquo;t allowing anyone to mention Hadwin Stephenson, blocking his news and only announcing to the public about his disappearance. All of the Stephenson family's affairs are temporarily handled by the first wife's family. Hadwin Stephenson's men have all been released from their duties."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A look of worry came over Grace's face when she heard this. "Could Hadwin Stephenson be..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "He's probably alive. If something had indeed happened to Hadwin Stephenson, the first wife would&rsquo;ve been eager to announce everything so they can take over the Stephenson family smoothly. She would not be going through so many troubles. They&rsquo;re only doing this because they're afraid Hadwin Stephenson will come back and seize power!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace breathed a sigh of relief at that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'As long as Hadwin Stephenson is alive!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During Lina's second surgery, Grace waited with Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney outside the operating room. It was not until the surgery was over and the doctor said everything was fine that she breathed a long sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, Grace." Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney had completely changed their attitude toward Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They regarded Grace as the Sweeney family's savior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uncle, Aunt, you don't need to thank me. Lina has done more for me," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Sweeney sighed. "I wonder what on earth happened to Lina when she went to find Hadwin. Hadwin is also still missing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe by the time Lina wakes up, we'll have news about Hadwin Stephenson," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope so," said Mrs. Sweeney while Mr. Sweeney put his hand on his wife's shoulder, patting her to comfort her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace also hoped Hadwin Stephenson would show up soon so that they could find out what had happened and why Lina was so seriously injured!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During the weekend, Grace and Jason went to Grace's mother's grave together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her mother's black-and-white photo on the gravestone, Grace's eyes could not help watering again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mother was smiling gently at her as if she was happy for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Mom, I'm happy now. I married Jay, and I have three babies in my belly. You can feel at ease now. After the three babies are born, Jay and I will come and see you again with them. Mom, if you're up there, I hope you can ensure the safe birth of the three babies."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason also said, "Mom, I'll protect Grace, and I will never let her be wronged or get hurt again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace seemed a little stunned as she turned her head to look at Jason.</p></div>
