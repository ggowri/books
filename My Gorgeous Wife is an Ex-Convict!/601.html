        <h1>Chapter 600</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said nothing but drove on with a panic he had never felt before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know what he was afraid of. Was he afraid of Brian finding out that Grace was the one he was looking for, or was he afraid that Grace would have feelings for Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, Brian... Could not have figured it out. He had tampered with the evidence just in case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace... It seemed that she really did not remember the events of that year. After investigating the matter, he knew that Grace had fallen ill a few days after Brian was found. She was even sent straight back to Emerald City with a high fever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was probably because of the fever that she could not remember some things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that... Even though he was prepared, why was he still agitated?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if there were exceptions to everything. Some things would happen without him knowing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like the pictures he saw of Brian holding her while crying. What was she thinking then? Why had she never said anything to him about it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was she trying to hide?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, where the hell are you driving to? I have to go back to the restaurant this afternoon to deliver food," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason did not seem to be listening as he did not give her any answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip. She then took out her phone and called Kyla. "I... I'm a little caught up right now, Kyla. I'm afraid I won't be able to get back to the restaurant for a while... Yes, it's all right. I'm sorry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the call was over, Grace suddenly saw an earlier call from Jason in her call history.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The call lasted more than one minute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not take the call! Grace had a sudden shock and thought of Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was changing her clothes, she did not take her phone and bag into the changing room but left them on the seat next to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was that when... Brian took the call?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, Jason's sudden appearance in the shop made sense to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Was it Brian who answered your call earlier? I was changing and my phone was outside... I only met Brian by chance today. My clothes got dirty when I was delivering orders..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can you not say anything now, Grace?" His voice suddenly rang in the car, making her stop talking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip. From her point of view, his face was cold and terribly gloomy. He seemed to be gripping the steering wheel with all his might.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A suffocating silence filled the car again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he... Misunderstand that something was going on between her and Brian? Grace thought to herself. She would have to wait for the car to stop before she could explain to Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car finally stopped, Grace found that the car had stopped on the top of Ganyang Mountain which overlooked Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Usually, during holidays, many people would drive here to see the scenery. However, at this hour, there was no one around. Except for the chirping of insects and birds, it was quiet.</p></div>
