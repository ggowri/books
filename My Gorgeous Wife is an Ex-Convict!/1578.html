        <h1>Chapter 1576</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is this woman...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Immediately, the manager and the sales assistant who had tried to curry favor with Irene Lynch went pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace generously accepted the card and did not refuse it. Then, she said to the junior sales assistant who had been serving her. "I'll take this gown. Please wrap it up for me after I change out of it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"O-Okay..." she said excitedly. As a newcomer, she had hit the jackpot to get such a sale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was more embarrassed and wanted to pick up her bag to leave quietly, but Grace stopped her. "Miss Lynch, we're not done yet. Don't you want to look at the surveillance footage?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No... No thanks. I was the one who spilled water on myself by accident," Irene Lynch said with a dry laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Lynch, since you were the one who spilled water on yourself, aren't you going to apologize for making people misunderstand that my friend splashed water on you?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch looked surprised and asked almost subconsciously, "Apologize?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Shouldn't you?" Grace asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch's face could not help reddening. She thought she was special ever since her daughter became the adopted daughter of the Reed family. Besides, even those socialites and wealthy women fawned over her. Since when did she have to apologize to others? She even had to apologize to an ordinary person. Was it just because she was Grace's friend?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It would be humiliating for her to apologize, especially with all these people watching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Lynch, since Young Madam is asking you to apologize, I think you'd better apologize. You'll still have to apologize when Young master Reed hears about this," Terrence said out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch had to bite the bullet and apologize to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The manager and the sales assistant also apologized with a look of horror. Who would have thought that between these two women, the one dressed in plain clothes would be Young master Reed's wife?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was Young master Reed! Who in Emerald City dared to offend Young master Reed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Not far away, a woman's eyes fell on Lina's face with amusement. A sneer rose from the corners of her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson did not expect to meet Lina in a place like this. Besides, Lina's friend appeared to be Jason's wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... it was useless even if the Reed family was willing to back Lina up. Hadwin was hers. She would eventually get the man she wanted. There were no exceptions!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina followed when Grace went to change out of the gown. Irene Lynch was about to leave with a grim face, but Terrence stopped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Terrence... What... What's the matter?" asked Irene Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Lynch, you seem to be spending quite a lot of money these days. The gowns here aren't what ordinary people can afford," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was a little at a loss as she said, "I... I was just looking around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's great that you were just looking around. Miss Lynch, what you spend should be in line with your status. If you aim too high and seek something you shouldn't, then you'll probably get nothing in the end," Terrence said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was stunned. She could tell that Terrence was warning her to stop going after Jason!</p></div>
