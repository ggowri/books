        <h1>Chapter 878</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Stella took a different turn in the conversation. "It's just that Brian once mistook you for the one he was looking for, so I hope you can keep your distance from Brian and avoid any unnecessary misunderstandings between us. We're relatives, after all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly let out a chuckle. "Unnecessary misunderstandings? What kind of misunderstandings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You were pulling and pushing with Brian at the film studio last time. It's easy for others to get the wrong idea," said Stella. Then, she added coyly. "I'm with Brian now. We haven't announced anything officially yet, but soon..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella spoke with deliberate hesitation, leaving people space for imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have nothing to do with Brian, so don't worry about it," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wouldn't it be better if you could avoid appearing in front of him? Or... I could sponsor you to develop your career somewhere else? You could open up a shop or something. Wouldn't life be easier? We're sisters. I have enough money now anyway. Why don't I give you two million dollars first?" said Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Two million dollars?' Grace just found it funny. 'The two million dollars is probably Brian's money. Now, the impostor's going to use the money she got from Brian to drive me&mdash;the real deal&mdash;out of Emerald City?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she think I'm that easy to fool? Or is she too greedy?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If one day Brian finds out you&rsquo;ve been lying to him, tell me, would he take the money back?" Grace asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella immediately felt a thump in her heart, and her expression gradually grew unnatural. "What are you talking about? What did I lie to Brian about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Was it really you who saved Brian on the hill?" Grace looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course. Could it be a lie?" Stella said, trying to keep her composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Was it really you who saved him?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean? Who else if it wasn't me?" Stella insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her with a sneer. "Sis, do you really think I'm that easy to fool? Do you think I'll believe whatever you say? You're not the one who saved Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's face immediately paled, but she then said out of anger, "If it wasn't me, then could it have been you? Do you think it was you just because I told you what happened on the hill when I was a kid? You've fooled Brian into thinking you saved his life. What are you going to do now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis, the memories I&rsquo;ve lost have come back, so you don't have to say that much in front of me. The more you spin this story around, the more ridiculous it seems to me," Grace said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella stiffened and stared at the person in front of her with disbelief. "What&hellip; What are you saying... Did you... get your memory back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. How else would I have known that you&rsquo;re so good at spinning stories?" Grace replied sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I don't know what you're talking about!" Stella insisted. She was not going to admit to being an impostor no matter what. "Grace, you're not trying to hook up with Brian just because you&rsquo;ve broken up with Jason, are you? You're going too far if that's true!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I go talk to Brian now? What do you think he'll think?" Grace asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you dare!" Stella panicked. 'If Grace tells him, then... Everything I have now will be gone.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why wouldn't I dare?" Grace laughed. "Why wouldn't I dare say things I've done myself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a split second, Stella felt cold and began to tremble as a sense of extreme fear filled her body.</p></div>
