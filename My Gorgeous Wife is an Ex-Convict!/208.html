        <h1>Chapter 207</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The part-time job that Claire was talking about was to be an extra on a filming set. The job only required her to register her name and leave her contact number, so there was no need to look at any files.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was 80 bucks a day with lunch included. If an extension was needed for the filming time, they would provide dinner as well, but there would not be any extra pay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Claire said, since she was free on her rest days, she could be an extra and earn some cash. It was a job that was paid by the day after all. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One month down the line, if there was something for her to do every rest day, then in that one month, she could earn a few hundred bucks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To other people, a few hundred bucks might not be much, but to Grace, it was already really good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she left work, Grace glanced at the gloves that she had already finished knitting and made a call to Jason. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve finished knitting the gloves. Do you want me to send it over, or do you want to get someone to come over and collect it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just come and collect it, then,&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; she replied. She then returned to her rental home. After finishing her dinner, she placed the gloves on the table and pulled out the photocopies of the case files that Lina had given to her last time regarding her car accident. In it, there were transcripted statements from the witnesses at the time, along with photocopies of the photographs of various physical evidence from back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the contents, feelings of shock and bitterness rose in Grace&rsquo;s heart. Among this evidence, there was even the wine bottle and glass that she had drunk from that day, along with her DNA that was detected from the rim of the glass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was simply laughable. It was a glass that she had never drunk from, yet her DNA was somehow on it. She had no way of overthrowing this evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know who it was who wanted to hurt her like this, but what was the deal with Jennifer Atkinson? Even if they wanted to hurt her, it was Jennifer Atkinson who ended up losing her life! Maybe they wanted to hurt Jennifer Atkinson but was using her as a scapegoat?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyway, it had been three years. While she was in jail, she could not figure out exactly who it was who had such a deep grudge against her. Plus, finding out whoever it was who had such a deep hatred for Jennifer Atkinson was not something the person she was now could easily do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, someone in Grace&rsquo;s Messenger group tagged all of the members.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the group, and it was the Messenger group for background actors that she had just entered today. The group organizer was tagging all of the members to notify them about the next job&rsquo;s time, location, name of the crew, as well as the number of people needed and the requirements for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the date, and it just so happened to be her rest day. Hence, she immediately sent a private message to the organizer and carried out the registration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Okay, on that day, gather at the main gate of Cultural City at eight in the morning,&rsquo; the organizer texted back to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Alright,&rsquo; Grace replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although being an extra did not pay much, this was one of the few things that she had a grasp on right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Putting down her phone, she was just about to do a search on the internet about news related to the show that she was to appear in when someone knocked on her door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only person who would come over at this time would be&hellip; Grace pursed her lips before standing up. She walked to the door and opened it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As expected, the person that showed up in her line of vision was Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was dressed in an all-black overcoat with neatly styled hair to go with his handsome features. His entire person looked elegant and classy from top to bottom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only exception to that was possibly the scarf wrapped around his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was&hellip; the scarf that she had knitted for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the scarf on Jason&rsquo;s neck with a complicated expression on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to his full attire of luxurious clothing, her scarf looked so rough and cheap. It was laughable that she had rushed to finish it back then because she was afraid that he would be cold. She had even been pleased with herself, thinking that it was not badly done. In the end, it just looked like a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he was actually using this scarf, making Grace feel this indescribable feeling in her heart.</p></div>
