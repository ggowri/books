        <h1>Chapter 2120</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We need to go to Municipal Women's Hospital to see the specialists there," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Municipal Women's Hospital?" Martin Weiss's brows furrowed instantly. They had to go to a tertiary hospital, so there must be something a regular community hospital like this could not deal with. "What happened? Is there something wrong with your health?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Having undergone a liver transplant, the maternity examination here isn't suitable for me," Kyla said as she took out her phone. She logged into tMason Swansonty's hospital registration system but found that the specialists in Municipal Women's Hospital had all been fully booked. She could not book an appointment at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All the specialists in the registration system... were even fully booked for the coming week. She could only wait for the system to open for appointments a week later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla seemed troubled. She pondered about it and thought she could only ask Grace to help her get an appointment with a specialist from Municipal Women's Hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was thinking of dialing Grace's phone number when Martin Weiss's voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's me, Martin Weiss. I want to see a specialist from Municipal Women's Hospital. Yes, today. This morning!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked up and saw Martin Weiss speaking to the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, Martin Weiss ended the call and said to Kyla, "Let's go to Municipal Women's Hospital. You can see a specialist as soon as you get there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze. "You got an appointment?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yea, I asked someone to arrange it for me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When they got to Municipal Women's Hospital, a young man was already waiting there. As soon as he saw Martin Weiss, he came up to them. "Mr. Weiss, this way, please."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The young man led the way while Martin Weiss and Kyla followed him. When they reached the clinic&rsquo;s entrance, Kyla realized it was no ordinary specialist clinic but a VIP specialist clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After waiting at the lounge for a while, a nurse came and led Kyla to the consultation room. Martin Weiss followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was seen by a middle-aged specialist in her 40s. Kyla looked at the nameplate placed on the desk. She was called He Yunxia. Kyla had heard of the name after she got pregnant. She was one of the top three obstetricians in Emerald City, so one could imagine how astounding she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Dr. He looked a little solemn after going through the liver transplant case report Kyla brought over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, she went through some of Kyla's initial pregnancy reports and asked, "Are you taking any medication?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I used to take painkillers when I felt some pain after the liver transplant. I took them on and off for five years, but I had already stopped taking them for a while before I got pregnant. I haven&rsquo;t taken them since finding out I'm pregnant," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It has been five years since your liver transplant. You don't have any recurrent symptoms, so you're probably safe now. But pregnancy puts a strain on your organs, including the liver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">You might be okay right now, but the burden will become more obvious as you're further along in your pregnancy. You&rsquo;ve undergone a liver transplant, so your liver is a little more fragile than the average person&rsquo;s. There's a good chance your body won't be able to handle it," said Dr. He.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Based on her current medical report, the pregnancy would be risky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What will happen... if she can't handle it?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"There might be changes to the liver. The baby might not be able to survive, and the mother might be at risk," said Dr. He. Then, she checked Kyla's age. She was already 35 years old. "Actually, I would recommend you to terminate the pregnancy if you already have children."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's heart sank immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Terminate... the pregnancy?'</p></div>
