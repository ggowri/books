        <h1>Chapter 2167</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Someone even said it was expected of him to do such an evil thing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not do it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not push Nelson Corbyn down the stairs at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, just as he opened his mouth, a figure flashed crossed his mind again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was Jasper! If he returned with his father, he would be leaving the Reed family and Emerald City. He would never see Jasper again, would he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm... not leaving." Finally, the three words escaped his mouth softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow raised his eyebrows slightly. It seemed his son was really stubborn. "Are you staying because of Jasper Reed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you think Jasper will think highly of you even if you continue staying with the Reed family? You're just a playmate to her, and she doesn't care much about you. Look, did she choose to trust you in this incident? Like all the others, she's convinced that you pushed Nelson Corbyn down the stairs. She doesn't believe you no matter how you explain it, does she?" said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William widened his eyes and looked at Philip Barlow in disbelief, wondering why he knew everything so well. It was as if he had witnessed it himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow smiled faintly. "If she believes you, she wouldn't be ignoring you and refusing to play with you in kindergarten."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew how the little ones got along in kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"aunt Cummins will find out the truth. aunt Cummins's a lawyer. She... She'll help me find evidence. Then everyone will know I didn't push Nelson Corbyn down the stairs. Jasper... will believe me too." William's face reddened slightly as he defended himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow said, "Grace is just a lawyer, not the police. If Jasper only trusts you when the truth comes out, she trusts you just as much as she trusts other people. Why would you be reluctant to leave someone like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William&rsquo;s face turned even redder. After holding it in for a long time, he finally said, "I'm not leaving... no matter what."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But you'll never get what you want if you stay with the Reed family!" said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His pretty yet childish dark eyes gleamed with doubt. 'Isn't what I want to be with Jasper? I feel content as long as Jasper smiles at me every day!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow said nothing more. He only said, "You can keep my phone number. If you want to return to the Barlow family, call me as soon as possible. I'm not sure how long I'll be staying in Emerald City." With that said, he patted his son's little head and left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William froze but followed him out of the room too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two figures came out one after the other, and another figure was secretly hiding not far away. It was Jasper Reed, who had sneaked out of the classroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper had not fallen asleep during nap time. She happened to see a teacher leading William out of the nap room. She found it strange and sneaked out while the other teachers were not paying attention. Then, she saw William enter a room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She waited outside for a long time before seeing William come out. However, he came out with another uncle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Who is this uncle? Does William know him?' Jasper Reed's little head was full of all sorts of speculation.</p></div>
