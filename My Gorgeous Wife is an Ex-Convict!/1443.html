        <h1>Chapter 1442</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Kyla Corbyn's face was calm after hearing what he said. It was as if she had just heard about an unimportant matter. "Are you done? If you are, please get out of the way. I want to take my son home!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kyla, I know you don't want to see me, and I... I'm trying to avoid showing up in front of you. But I beg you, don't reject me. At least, don't reject my liver. If you don't do the surgery, you might&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Shut up!" Kyla Corbyn immediately interrupted Martin Weiss and looked nervously at her son, fearing he might find out about her illness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She deliberately avoided her son whenever she took her medicine as she was unwilling to let the little one know that she was having an illness that was killing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not want to spend her remaining days having the little one worry about her illness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing Kyla Corbyn's agitated look, Martin Weiss immediately understood that the child probably had no idea about her illness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is there something wrong with Mommy and she needs surgery?" Nelson asked in confusion as he blinked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Nothing. I'm fine," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, things did not go as she expected. She suddenly began to feel pain in her liver as soon as she said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She endured the pain, only wanting to get her son home as soon as possible and secretly take her painkillers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Nelson, let's go." Kyla Corbyn tried to make her voice sound normal as she took her son's hand to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, a big hand grabbed Kyla Corbyn's arm. "Are you in pain again?" Martin Weiss asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn frowned and seemed to want to break away from Martin Weiss's grip. "Let go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Tell me, are you hurting again?" He seemed determined to get the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He knew that the more frequent the pain, the more serious her illness was. "No, I'll take you to the hospital now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin Weiss, have you had enough? I don't need to go to a hospital, I..." Kyla Corbyn only felt the pain in her liver becoming more severe after Martin Weiss pulled her. She could hardly finish speaking now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing his father grabbing his mother like this, Nelson recalled the scene in the small park last time. At that time, his father had grabbed his mother in the same way. When he saw his mother again afterward, she was in the hospital with her forehead injured and bleeding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Let go of Mommy! I'm not going to let you take Mommy away." The little one's body grew tense, and he looked like a lion cub about to raise its tail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Nelson, I have to take your mommy to the hospital. I promise I won't hurt her! Your mommy's ill, so she's in pain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one could also see that something was wrong with his mother. She looked pale, and her forehead was covered with sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, his mother's back was bent while her hands covered her upper abdomen. Her teeth seemed to be chattering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one's face immediately became filled with unease. "Mommy! Mommy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn wanted to tell her child that she was fine, but it seemed that she could not even speak right now.</p></div>
