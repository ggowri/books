        <h1>Chapter 1575</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, when Grace wore the gown, Irene Lynch knew that even if she got her hands on it, she would not wear it to the banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What a coincidence, Miss Cummins. I didn't expect you to be here," Irene Lynch said with embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's quite coincidental, indeed. I heard the noise when I was in the fitting room earlier. I didn't expect it to be you," said Grace. Then, she corrected, "Also, I think you should be calling me Mrs. Reed. Didn't Jay warn you about it last time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch ground her teeth. 'Jay... Jay... How intimately she was referring to him.' She had tried to call Young master Reed &lsquo;Jason&rsquo; once but he unhappily warned her to call him Mr. Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if she did not deserve to call him &lsquo;Jason&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mrs. Reed..." Irene Lynch laughed dryly and said, "It was only a misunderstanding earlier. Don't mind it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How could it be a misunderstanding? This woman's friend splashed water all over you," the sales assistant who had been flattering Irene Lynch said. She looked like she wanted to stand up for Irene Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch felt even more embarrassed. "Well... Yes..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We'll find out what happened just by looking at the surveillance footage," said Grace as she glanced around. Sure enough, she found the surveillance camera. "If anyone has wronged my friend, I'll sue for slander and defamation as per the laws."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch froze and quickly said, "It's just a misunderstanding. Why make a big deal out of it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't think I'm making a big deal," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch almost crushed her teeth. No matter how slow the sales assistant and manager were, they could see that her attitude toward Grace was different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was almost like she was afraid of offending Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, three men walked into the shop. One of them was Terrence. Terrence rushed over to Grace and respectfully gave her an infinite card. "Young Madam, Young master Reed said you can keep this card with you. You can use this card to buy anything you want. There's no limit, and you don't need to report to Young master Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace took the card. She did not expect Terrence to deliver the card here. Before she tried on the gown, she had received a phone call from Jason and mentioned that she would be shopping for a gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had asked Jason if there was a way to transfer money or buy it on credit because of the gown's high price point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not expect him to ask Terrence to deliver her a card, and it all happened so soon too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The manager and other staff in the boutique were surprised to hear this, especially when they saw the infinite card Terrence handed over. Working in the boutique, they met many socialites and wealthy women. They had seen such infinite cards before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... it was rare. There were not many people who had such cards in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now, this woman had such a card in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, the man who just handed her the card had said something like &lsquo;Young master Reed&rsquo;. Only one person in Emerald City had such an infinite card and was referred to as &lsquo;Young master Reed&rsquo;!</p></div>
