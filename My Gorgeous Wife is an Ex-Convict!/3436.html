        <h1>Chapter 3434</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These are also some words from Lionel that gave him a sudden feeling of clarity and relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, sometimes achieving a certain goal doesn't necessarily require a tough approach. Veronica actually responds better to a more gentle approach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he lowers his attitude, she will be more likely to accept.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since she always refers to him as her "little brother", he will comply with her wishes and be a good little brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for her desire for "respect," he can give it to her. Even if she truly likes Daniel, he will find a way to make her stop liking him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only one she could like is him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, can we stop giving each other the silent treatment from now on?" Mason said softly, with a slight hint of pity in his voice, his eyebrows and eyes drooping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt a sudden pang of sympathy for Mason, and said, "Okay, let's stop giving each other the silent treatment from now on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the following days, as promised, Mason did not snatch the bubble tea from her hands and throw it away, even when he saw Daniel giving it to her. He simply watched quietly as she finished her drink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, being watched by him so quietly made her feel even more uneasy and nervous for some reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why... are you staring at me while I drink?" she asked with a pout.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He just felt that when Veronica was drinking her milk tea, it seemed like she was enjoying something very delicious," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Actually... it's not too bad," she said awkwardly. After all, the milk tea that Daniel had bought for her was from the school's convenience store, and the taste was actually quite familiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What kind of feelings does Veronica have towards Mr. Cross?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's face suddenly showed a hint of shyness, "It's just the feeling of a senior."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh really? I thought Veronica liked him," said Mason. As he spoke, his face remained expressionless, as if he was just casually making a comment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's heart lifted up suddenly, but when she saw Mason's seemingly indifferent expression, she breathed a sigh of relief and simply said, "No, you're overthinking it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her true feelings were revealed by the blush on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's eyes caught a glimpse of the blush on her face, and his gaze gradually darkened. So, Veronica really has fallen for Daniel, hasn't she? And for her, he's just a younger brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if she also likes him, this kind of liking is completely different from her liking for Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However... he won't let anyone have Veronica, even if that person is the one she likes in her heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she really falls for Daniel, then... he will destroy that feeling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel's visits to Veronica's classroom became more and more frequent, and people from both classes began to speculate about their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The rumors about Veronica and Mason, which were once rampant, were now quelled because of this phenomenon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some even said, "Veronica and Mason have a sibling relationship. If there really is anything going on, Mason would have beaten up Daniel for constantly going to Veronica's side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly!" someone chimed in, "Besides, Veronica isn't even that pretty. Mason is the second son of the Reed family! How could he really be interested in Veronica? They just grew up together and see each other as siblings."</p></div>
