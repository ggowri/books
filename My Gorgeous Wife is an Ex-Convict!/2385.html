        <h1>Chapter 2383</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The voice... sounded hostile. Grace frowned and glanced at Kyla. The expression of the staff member who led them here changed as if they had suddenly recalled something. They hurriedly moved to stop the three of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss beat the staff member to it by blocking their way, while Kyla and Grace hurried toward Amber Mitchell's ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I remember you. These are the dishes I specially instructed the cook to prepare. Sis, you gotta finish them!" The woman's voice continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then came the muffled groans of struggle and the sound of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla&rsquo;s and Grace's expressions changed abruptly as they looked through the small window on the ward's door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A woman in a white hospital gown was being held down by two other people dressed as hospital nurses. One of them even pressed the head of the woman in the hospital gown into the food in front of her, which could not be seen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman's body and hair were covered with food. She was in such a mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not far away stood another woman with elaborate makeup and designer clothes. It was... Louise Mitchell, Amber Mitchell's stepsister!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla and Grace had gone through the information they found and knew what Louise Mitchell looked like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If that was the case, the woman in the hospital gown who was being held down was without a doubt Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla tried to push the door open to enter, but the door was locked from the inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Open the door! What are you doing?! How could you do this to her?" Kyla shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The people inside were shocked. Louise Mitchell turned her head and saw Kyla and Grace through the window on the door. She frowned and got the two nurses who were holding Amber Mitchell to take her aside. Then, she called Amber Mitchell's attending doctor. "What's wrong with your hospital? Why are people shouting outside the ward? I need you to get those people out of here! I don't want any drama..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss kicked down the ward door before she ended her phone call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla ran toward Amber Mitchell, and Grace hurried to follow. The two nurses tried to shield Amber Mitchell from these outsiders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of the nurses raised one hand to push Kyla, but Martin Weiss waved it away before she could touch Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who... Who are you? Who permitted you to barge into patients' wards? Where's security? Where are the hospital&rsquo;s security guards?" Louise Mitchell shouted to the staff member who led Kyla and the rest here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The staff member seemed to be in a dilemma. "Mrs. Gregory, they're friends of the hospital&rsquo;s director. Well... I... I was just showing them around the hospital, and they happened to run into you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't care what they're here for. Get them out of here immediately!" Louise Mitchell said, looking upset. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla did not care what Louise Mitchell was saying. All her attention was on Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The beautiful Amber Mitchell had fallen into this state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell, it's me. It's me! I'm Kyla. Do you remember me? Look at me and tell me what's going on? How did you end up in here?" Kyla sobbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Amber Mitchell kept her head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From Kyla's statement, Louise Mitchell figured out that these people knew Amber Mitchell, but Amber Mitchell's lack of reaction was within her expectation.</p></div>
