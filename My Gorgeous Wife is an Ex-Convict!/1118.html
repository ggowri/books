        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled faintly. "Could she and I possibly have a pleasant conversation? In the Stephenson family, she's probably the one who wants me dead the most."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina thought about it. 'That's true. Hadwin Stephenson is now in charge of the Stephenson family, so the first wife and her family are naturally dying with rage.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They were the ones who set up the meeting you had with Elizabeth Jackson today. They want to take the opportunity of the marriage between the Stephenson family and the Jackson family to help them regain their rights to the Stephenson family," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina blinked. "But if they're going to use the Jackson family against you, shouldn't they let Elizabeth Jackson marry either one of your two half-brothers?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Elizabeth Jackson is just a sacrifice," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sacrifice?" Lina was confused. "Isn't Elizabeth Jackson the daughter of the Jackson family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s true that she&rsquo;s the daughter of the Jackson family. However, she's just a child the Jackson family took in by mistake. The Jackson family has already found the child they lost. They just haven't announced it to the public. Even Elizabeth Jackson doesn't know about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's eyes immediately widened. 'No way. Are you kidding me? It's just like a plot from a cheesy drama!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"To the Jackson family, their biological daughter is the most important thing. As for Elizabeth Jackson, since she's not their biological daughter, she's only a sacrifice they can use." Hadwin Stephenson continued saying, "They thought that if they married Elizabeth Jackson to me, I would think that the Jackson family and I were of one mind. When the time comes, the Jackson family will defect and leave me with no power. Then, the Stephenson family will naturally belong to the first wife and her family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's mood fluctuated when she heard this. She felt that her IQ was not suitable for palace dramas!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But how do you know that Elizabeth Jackson isn't the Jackson family's biological daughter?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I found out, of course. If I'm not even capable of doing this, how could I have taken control of the Stephenson family?" Hadwin Stephenson said with a laugh. His face was full of confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina just thought her boyfriend looked good when he was confident. It made her have the urge to fangirl again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But it looks like you're a target now too," said Hadwin Stephenson. The fact that Elizabeth Jackson found Lina today was a sign.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned, "Then... What are we gonna do now? Pretend to have a fight and break up or something?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know whether to laugh or cry after hearing her words. What was going on inside this woman's head? "Don't even think about breaking up!" He bent down and bit her cheek a little as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Lina cried out in pain and touched the bite mark on her cheek. There were shallow teeth marks. "I said pretend, not break up for real."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, not even if we&rsquo;re only pretending! Didn't we make a deal? We must never break up once we start dating!" He rubbed her head gently as he spoke, "Don't worry. I'll settle the Stephenson family's affairs as soon as possible. At most, it'll be settled in three months!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Three months? "What are you going to do?" asked Lina, suddenly feeling that Hadwin Stephenson seemed to be holding back something big.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Make sure the first wife and her family can no longer cause trouble, of course," said Hadwin Stephenson as his eyes stared at her. "I told you before that I won't drag you into the Stephenson family's dirty mess, and I'll keep my word!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina smiled. "Yes, I believe you. You can do it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her trusting look stirred his heart. He leaned forward, and his lips gently pressed against the spot on her face where he had bitten her. "Does it hurt?"</p></div>
