        <h1>Chapter 3816</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her shoulder was completely... powerless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica lay on the ground, gasping for breath, not knowing if her shoulder bones were crushed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain was too intense, and she didn't even have the strength to stand up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even if she could stand up now, with her shoulder like this, she wouldn't have the strength to push open that door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that she was really going to die here, just as Daniel had said!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, Mason didn't come. That way, only she would die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least she wouldn't burden anyone else anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Come to think of it, maybe she should be grateful that she and him broke up. If they hadn't broken up, he would have come to save her no matter what if he knew she was in danger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they've broken up and he doesn't have any feelings for her anymore, so he naturally won't come!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although it's actually a good thing, she couldn't help feeling a sense of loss in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought... it was because she still loved him, that's why she felt lost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She slowly closed her eyes and hoped that before she died, she could have a dream where she could see him. That way, even in death, the pain would be a little less.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, a sound mixed with the sound of falling rocks, the sound of a door being pushed open.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she imagine it? Veronica wondered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then came a hoarse shout, "Veronica! Veronica, are you alive?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this still an illusion? She continued to think, it was Mason's voice. She couldn't believe that she could hear Mason's voice when she was about to die.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this God's mercy on her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, she felt someone pick up her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The heavy breathing sounded in her ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this also an illusion? Veronica suddenly opened her eyes and saw the familiar face - it was Mason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he was covered in dust and dirt, with torn clothes and a bloodstain mixed with the dirt on his forehead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you still have strength, hold onto me and I'll take you out!" His hoarse voice rang out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it really him? Veronica stared at the person in front of her in a daze. "Don't worry about me, leave quickly... it's going to explode... put me down... hurry and leave..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke intermittently, but the dust around her was so thick that every time she spoke, she felt like her mouth was full of it, making it almost impossible to speak.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason, however, had no time to pay attention to Veronica's words. He picked her up and rushed out of the auditorium at a very fast speed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had glanced at the explosion schedule before, and if the order and timing of the explosions were really as shown on the chart, then the auditorium would be the next building to be blown up after the fourth one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The most important thing now was to get away from the auditorium as quickly as possible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt like she was flying as Mason held her and rushed out of the auditorium at an extremely fast speed. However, the ground outside was already covered in rubble, large and small, and the ground was uneven. Even the debris from the destroyed buildings nearby was like an avalanche, constantly surging towards them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he put her down, he could run even faster, but...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked up at Mason running, and from her angle, she could see his determined jaw, nose, and his eyes fixed straight ahead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He held her tightly and didn't even think about letting her go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He came in to find her in such a dangerous situation to save her, right? But... why? Wasn't he tired? Didn't he stop loving her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did he still risk his life to save her like this?</span></p></div>
