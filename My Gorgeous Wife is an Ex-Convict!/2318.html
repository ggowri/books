        <h1>Chapter 2316</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla watched the time as she waited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he had put their relationship behind him and was cold and unfeeling toward her, she still wanted to ask him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because she did not have any other way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all she could do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, she saw the gates of Weiss Residence opening slowly. A black sedan gradually drove out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hurried forward and approached the backseat window. Looking at the glass window, she shouted, "Martin, hear me out. I know you don't want to see me, but I really need you to agree to this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, the driver in the front asked, "Mr. Weiss, should I stop?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need. Drive straight to the company," Martin Weiss said indifferently as he moved his gaze away from Kyla who was outside the car window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not have any feelings for this woman anymore, so... even if she banged on the car window with an anxious face while pregnant, he would still be indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car... drove away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stood there blankly, her expression was of disappointment and bitterness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He... did not stop at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Well, why should he give her a chance now after she flatly refused him when he so earnestly begged her to give him a chance back then?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the one who hurt him first...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lip and walked to the intersection. She raised her hand to hail a taxi and gave the driver the address of Martin Weiss&rsquo;s company. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her only option was to go there again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the receptionist did not stop her and let her in right away this time. When Kyla said she was here to see Martin Weiss, she even considerately pressed the elevator floor button for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mrs. Weiss, we didn't know who you were last time and it was our job to stop you. I hope you'll be the bigger person and forgive us," she said respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze and immediately understood that Mallory Malcom calling her &lsquo;Mrs. Weiss&rsquo; had given them ideas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the employee had no idea that Martin Weiss did not want to see her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter what happened yesterday. Don't overthink it," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Relieved, the receptionist exited the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The elevator doors closed slowly, and Kyla watched the floor numbers change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the elevator stopped on the 49th floor, Kyla stepped out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mallory Malcom, who was sitting at his desk, looked up to see Kyla. He was immediately surprised. "Mrs. Weiss, what... what are you doing here again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm here to see Martin Weiss. Is he in his office?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Chairman Weiss is in the office right now, but he... You..." Mallory Malcom said, looking like he was in a dilemma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't barge in. Could you tell him I'm here? If he refuses to see me, I'll wait outside. I'll see him when he leaves the office later," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was stupid, but it was the only solution she could think of at the moment.</p></div>
