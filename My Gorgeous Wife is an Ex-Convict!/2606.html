        <h1>Chapter 2604</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she said, "Martin Weiss, don't leave me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, I want to grow old with you.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, can we grow old together?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss, let's get married."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The series of baffling words confused Martin Weiss. "Kyla, what tricks are you trying to pull?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her expectant eyes dimmed. "I just wanted to see if I could lift your hypnosis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes glimmered, and he finally understood why she was speaking so strangely. "Are you trying to guess the password to break my hypnosis? Kyla, do you really think you can lift my hypnosis by saying such nonsense?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He got up and slowly walked up to her. "If you could easily figure out the password, why would I have bothered with it at all? What's more..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice paused as he raised his hand and caressed her hair, but his eyes were inscrutably deep. "Do you want to lift the hypnosis and let me restore my original feelings so that I can become the fool who loves you so much I&rsquo;ll give up my pride again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla trembled. "Do you think you were a fool back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Weren&rsquo;t I?" His fingers slipped from her hair to her cheek. However, his long and slender fingers were cold. "Wasn&rsquo;t I a fool to give up all my dignity and pride for a woman and plead with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His movements were so soft, but his touch was cold to the bone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice continued to ring in her ear. "Kyla, if I had owed you anything since the beginning, I&rsquo;ve already paid it off. You can forget about lifting the hypnosis. I set the password myself. I'm the only one who knows it, and no one will be able to figure it out, including you. It's easy if you want to lift the hypnosis. I just have to tell you the password now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes widened instantly as she looked blankly at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what he said next seemed to cast her into hell. "But I won't tell you that. I'll never tell you. Since I've decided to bury my past feelings, I won't let them come back. Kyla, I don't love you. Don't waste your time." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As his voice finished speaking, his hands let go of her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sat back at his desk and continued reading his documents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she stood there blankly as if her heart were empty!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even after walking out of Martin Weiss's study, Kyla was still a little confused. She was thinking about everything Martin Weiss had said earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that he could have restored his feelings at any time, but he was unwilling to do so!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had everything she done today just made herself look like a clown to him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Kyla was about to pass Shana Nicholls while going down the stairs, Shana Nicholls suddenly stopped. Shana Nicholls faced Kyla and asked, "Why did you come back?"</p></div>
