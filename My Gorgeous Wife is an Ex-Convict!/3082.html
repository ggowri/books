        <h1>Chapter 3080</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, please don't avoid me. If you hate me or blame me for not protecting you, you can hit me or curse me, but please don't avoid me. Don't refuse to look at me," Brian said. Compared to his usual indifferent and cold tone, he sounded urgent and pleading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes met his, and she pursed her lips slightly before saying, "Brian, I don't blame you, hate you, or even think about blaming you. When I chose to let Jasmine into the basket, it was my own decision, and no one forced me to do it! And the words I said to you before I was swept away by the water were all sincere, so you don't need to feel guilty about me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A hint of pain flashed in his eyes. The last words she said to him echoed in his mind countless times over the past year. But every time he thought about it, it only added to his pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, you said before that I would definitely meet the person I truly fall in love with! But have you ever thought that I have actually met that person a long time ago?" he said, as his hand gently caressed her cheek. "In fact, I have already met that person, but I was unaware of it and foolishly denied it all this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took a deep breath and passionately opened his lips, "Valda, I love you. I've actually fallen in love with you a long time ago, and I won't love anyone else in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's body suddenly trembled, and her round eyes widened in surprise as she looked at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her shocked expression made the corners of his lips lift slightly. "What, does the fact that I love you surprise you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He spoke and lowered his head, his forehead touching hers. His warm breath sprayed onto her face. "Actually, I should have said this to you a long time ago. I said it too late, making you wait for this sentence, waiting for so long."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even just a little bit more, he would have missed the chance to say this to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, God finally showed him mercy and let her survive, returning her to his side and giving him the chance to say these words!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's body stiffened. Although this was the sentence she had always wanted to hear, at this moment, listening to it, she felt an indescribable sadness in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I never imagined that one day, when she heard these words, she would feel this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never thought that when he said these words to her, one of her legs was already lame and could never be cured again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, thank you for saying those words to me." Even though they were just words of sympathy and pity, at least he gave her a satisfactory ending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda thought to herself, "This way, even if we separate in the future, she will have fewer regrets."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, I..." Brian wanted to say something more, but Valda took a step back and interrupted him, saying, "I'm tired, I want to rest first." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at her with a sad expression, but he knew he had to respect her wishes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda walked away without looking back, leaving Brian standing there alone. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sighed and turned to leave, feeling disappointed and unsure of what to do next. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he walked away, he couldn't help but wonder if he had lost Valda forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was taken aback, feeling that her current reaction was somewhat different from what he had previously imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had thought of many possible reactions she might have, but he never imagined she would be so calm, as if what he had just said was just an ordinary thing.</p></div>
