        <h1>Chapter 4113</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina is sulking in her room. Although she understands that by saying what he did, Chandler has given her the power to choose, and he will accept whatever decision she makes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she is still angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would rather he be a little selfish, rather he say that he will never let go, and that he must marry her no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Doesn't he know that if she gives birth to his child, it can save his life?! Why won't he be a little selfish?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Does he really love her? Or... does he love her a little, but not enough?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, there was a knock on the door. Moments later, Lina walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she entered the room, she saw her daughter lying on the bed, looking unhappy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A mother knows her daughter best. Lina approached and said, "Is it because of what Chandler said just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes!" Tina replied. "I feel like my feelings for Chandler are growing stronger and stronger, but he still treats me like he did when we were kids!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But Tina, you have to understand that in this world, being consistent is not an easy thing to do!" Lina touched her daughter's head and said, "Moreover, in my opinion, Chandler loves you too much, that's why he said that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Too much love?" Tina looked at her mother in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina smiled, "Everyone has a different personality. Some people love someone so much that they want to tie that person to themselves and don't allow them to have feelings for anyone else. But there are also people who are afraid of their own love becoming a burden to the other person. They want to give the other person enough freedom and are willing to silently endure the pain to make the other person happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "So, Mom, are you saying that Chandler is the latter type of person?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You understand me well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But I don't want him to give me any choice. I love him, and he loves me. So what if we get married earlier? He should have told Dad loudly just now that he wants to marry me, right away!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In this relationship, she felt more and more like she was the one taking the initiative, and he was just accepting it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If one day she stopped taking the initiative, would their relationship go back to the way it was before?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Maybe it's because of the age difference between Chandler and you. You are eight years apart, and often have different perspectives on things. And Chandler was born into a big family like Hunter's, so he has always been more restrained," Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When she first saw Chandler, she thought he was more mature than other kids his age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was like he was hiding all his thoughts and emotions deep inside!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He treated everyone the same, except for Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> At that time, Tina was just a baby, but she seemed to evoke some different emotions in him, making him smile and look like a kid his age!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Later, Chandler's expressions in front of Tina became more and more frequent, which made Lina gradually think that maybe it wasn't such a bad thing for these two kids to be engaged.</p></div>
