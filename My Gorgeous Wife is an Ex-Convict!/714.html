        <h1>Chapter 713</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Damn it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Crack!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the sound of glass cracking rang out, the glass in Martin Weiss's hand broke and pierced his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Immediately, blood ran down his right hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had held the glass so hard that he broke it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jewel Bailey gasped. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s nothing. Something came to my mind. Sorry, I lost my composure," Martin Weiss said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His right hand was still bleeding, but he did not seem to feel any pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Today was meant to cheer you up by letting you meet Jewel Bailey, but you got angry instead," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I'm glad I got to meet Jewel Bailey. Jason, thank you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't Martin Weiss make you angry?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm angry with Martin Weiss, not with you. I just feel aggrieved for Kyla and Nelson. Where was he when Kyla gave birth in prison? Now, he says he wants to fund Nelson's treatment? Isn't it funny? That&rsquo;s his own child!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace choked a little as she spoke. "His child was born with hearing problems. How much had Kyla suffered, getting up early and working late so that he could get a hearing aid for their child? Getting a hearing aid that cost 200,000 dollars was so difficult for Kyla, but 200,000 would be nothing more than a meal for him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes began to water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stroked Grace's eyes tenderly. "Why are you about to cry all of a sudden? If you feel sorry for Kyla and Nelson, we'll just help them out more from now on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right." Grace nodded. Then somewhat sheepishly, she said, "I'll go to the washroom and fix my makeup. Just wait for me here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go with you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright. Just wait for me here. I'll be quick!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would cause quite a stir if he waited for her outside the washroom. After all, many of the giant entrepreneurs at today's trade fair knew him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked in the direction of the washroom. When she was heading down a corridor, she could not help pausing in her tracks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On one side of the corridor, a slender figure was leaning against the wall, looking down at a small silver bracelet he held in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled wryly. 'What day is it today? I seem to be stumbling into a lot of people I don't want to see.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if sensing her eyes, Brian turned his head slightly and looked in her direction with his dark phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze immediately. The feeling somehow reminded her of what she felt in her dreams when the little boy, whose face she could not see, turned to look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could they be the same person? Could he be the same person as the little boy in my dreams?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If so, are my dreams really the memories I had lost?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stood rigidly where she was, watching him lift his foot and walking toward her step by step...</p></div>
