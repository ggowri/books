        <h1>Chapter 1399</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had dealt her never-ending blows!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stiffened. 'She... hates me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice was not loud, but the words had burst in his ears like a roar of thunder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It only seemed natural for him to take revenge on her and for her to hate him. He did not even care whether she hated him, or he would not have done such a thing to her back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she said the word &lsquo;hate&rsquo; now, it was as if there were thousands of sharp swords cutting at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her head was pressed down again and again. Her forehead repeatedly hit the tiled floor, producing numerous loud thuds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She owes Paisley these, but why does it sound so irritating to my ears?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was like a body without a soul, being treated in a humiliating manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I... gave the order.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Enough!' He wanted to say enough! He did not want to see it anymore. This apology was enough for her and him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if even though she was the one being forced to kneel and grovel, he was the one kneeling and groveling instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Martin Weiss opened his mouth to stop them, the door of the ward was suddenly kicked open by an external force. When Grace saw what was going on in the ward, she almost lost her footing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What... What am I seeing? How could these people do this to Kyla?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shouted instantly, "Stop! Who allowed you to do this to Kyla? Who are you to make her kneel and grovel?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice trembled with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason quickly grabbed her and told his men to take action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a short time, Martin Weiss's men were subdued in the ward, while the Daniels family and Martin Weiss were surrounded by Jason's men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was no longer being restrained. She fell limply to the ground, gasping for breath while her hands covered her abdomen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Ouch!' The severe pain from her illness seemed to consume her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, are you okay?" Grace asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ouch... I... I didn't bring... my painkillers..." Kyla Corbyn said with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes were red as she looked at Kyla Corbyn's pale face and blood-soaked forehead. There were clear slap prints on her cheeks as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll take you to a doctor!" she said as she had someone carry Kyla Corbyn. Then, she said to Jason, "Jay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it. I'll have someone get a doctor at once," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was hurriedly carried out. Grace looked at the three members of the Daniels family and her gaze finally fell on Martin Weiss. "I&rsquo;ve finally witnessed what cruelty is. Martin Weiss, is this how you&rsquo;re repaying Kyla for selflessly saving your life back then? You put her in prison last time and are even humiliating her before those who harmed her! Martin Weiss, you're ruthless. You're really ruthless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly trembled, and what Kyla Corbyn had said to him in the car today recurred to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he shuddered at the bad premonition he was having.</p></div>
