        <h1>Chapter 2720</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pain flashed across his eyes. Perhaps he only realized that the woman who used to love him had indeed stopped loving him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... "Are you serious about Brian?" Raymond Bowman asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller answered without hesitation, "Yes, I'm in a serious relationship with him. I also hope you won't disturb us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But how much do you know about him?" he continued asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mind flashed back to how he had gotten along with his friends in the club's private room and how they treated the women who adored them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People like them had their own set of values.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She and they were like two worlds apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I want to get to know him, I'll get to know him myself. I don't want anyone telling me anything," replied Valda Theller before turning around to enter the apartment building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you believe he loves you?" He suddenly stood in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why shouldn't I believe him?" she asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman suddenly said, "The person he loves is Grace! And Grace is the wife of Jason, the president of Reed group. Brian pursued Grace madly and even stopped dating after Grace. There are many socialites in Emerald City who can compare to her, and many beautiful female celebrities&mdash;whether popular or not&mdash;who want to be his girlfriend. Do you think he's dating you because he loves you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman said in a breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller quivered slightly. 'Grace's... the woman I ran into with Brian. The gentleness in Brian's tone was nothing like his usual indifference.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had never thought he could love a woman so deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman even used the word &lsquo;madly&rsquo;, which showed how much he loved Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If Grace's husband wasn't Jason, Brian would&rsquo;ve stolen Grace. He's probably playing this dating game with you on a whim," said Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you don't think Brian loves me? There are so many socialities and female celebrities. Why would Brian fall for a woman with no looks, money, or power like me? Is that what you mean?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman paused. After hesitating a little, he said, "I... I just don't want you to be fooled."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "Then I can tell you that I&rsquo;m not being fooled. Also, I don't think the reason he didn't snatch Grace away is that her husband is Jason. I think it's because Jason is the one Grace loves."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not because of Jason's influence and status!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... You're really..." For a moment, Raymond Bowman had no idea how to persuade her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Raymond Bowman, I think you should know that I hate lies the most, but Brian has never lied to me. I can confidently say that he... has never lied to me!" With that said, she went straight into the apartment building without another glance at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman was left alone. He stood in front of the apartment building with a bitter smile on his lips. "He never lied? Valda, you&rsquo;ll one day realize that you can't afford a man like him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller returned to her apartment, put down her bag, went into the bathroom, turned on the tap, and splashed her face with water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking up, she looked at her wet face. She knew she was not a stunning woman. Even though she was considered pretty, she was no match for the women around Brian.</p></div>
