        <h1>Chapter 3817</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, another explosion sounded. This time, it was in the auditorium!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, the ground shook and the auditorium began to collapse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even Mason stumbled and fell forward due to the force of the explosion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the moment he fell, his hands firmly protected her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason...you...you should run out by yourself, don't worry about me!" Veronica said urgently. At this time, she would only be a burden to him. It's better for one person to die than for both to die here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was willing to risk his life to save her, which was enough for her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't afraid of death, but she was afraid of dragging him down with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't talk nonsense!" Mason gritted his teeth and said, "Just hold onto my neck!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since he came in, he would take her out with him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason stood up again, but Veronica couldn't hold onto his neck because her shoulder had been injured by a falling cement block earlier.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason had to be even more careful, avoiding the points that were about to explode according to the blasting sequence he remembered, and running towards the safe zone in a roundabout way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica could feel that Mason's speed was slowing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if his physical fitness was strong, carrying her as a burden in such an environment would only increase his physical burden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of explosions rang out again and again, and every time it rang out, another building collapsed. Their running route also became more difficult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Mason fell again while holding her, but this time, he was crushed by flying debris from the collapsed building. However, in this critical moment, he pushed her forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was trapped, but she was safe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Run! As long as we run another 500 meters, we'll be safe!" He shouted at her, his handsome face almost unrecognizable due to dust and bloodstains. His dark eyes showed rare urgency.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she's safe, what about him? He's currently trapped under rocks, what should he do?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there will be another explosion soon!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The explosion hasn't completely stopped yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we're going to run, we'll run together!" Her shoulder was in excruciating pain, but she gritted her teeth and used all her strength to try and move the rocks that were weighing him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If they could just move them a little, with his abilities, they should be able to quickly escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you doing? Don't mess around, run, run fast!" Mason's voice became more anxious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I said, if we're going to run, we'll run together!" Veronica said through gritted teeth, her face turning red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her arm felt like it wasn't hers anymore, from her shoulder to her arm, and then to her whole body, she couldn't feel anything except for the pain.</span></p></div>
