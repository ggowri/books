        <h1>Chapter 1086</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Originally, she thought it was just a love story about a woman who forgot about her old lover and fell in love with another man. Was it not only a story about betrayal and love?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after hearing the end of the story, she felt differently. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did the woman fall in love and kill the man she loved because... she couldn&rsquo;t accept it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She couldn&rsquo;t accept that she had a change of heart and even fell in love with the man who imprisoned her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, what about afterward? What happened to the woman after she left? Did she go and live with the man she originally loved?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or did she live alone?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow, she wondered how the story would go next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Strangely enough, she was well past the age of curiosity but she was still curious about the woman Jason mentioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because... I&rsquo;m also being imprisoned in the same mansion?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got out of bed, went to the window, and opened the curtains.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could see the pond in the yard from her window. The pond of lotus flowers was stunning even at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to her surprise, a figure was standing on the edge of the pond and was seemingly looking at the lotus flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cold moonlight fell on Jason's body, and the place looked utterly silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the time. It was already past 1 AM. 'Why... is he still standing there?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She should have drawn the curtains and stopped looking at him, but she kept on staring at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, as if feeling her stare, he slowly turned sideways and looked in her direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their eyes met immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could see his face clearly in the moonlight. The silvery moonlight seemed to soften his delicate facial features and made him feel less indifferent and intense than in the day. He now looked more elegant and quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A few wisps of his bangs fell over his full forehead. What laid under his beautiful straight eyebrows were those deep eyes, straight nose bridge, and slightly thin lips. He stood as still as a statue, just looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only feel her heart beating faster and faster, making her heart flutter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop looking! Stop looking at him!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She told herself desperately, and with almost all her might, she drew the curtains before laying back in bed to calm herself down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With the lights on, Grace closed her eyes and put herself to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometime later, she seemed to hear the rhythm of the falling rain while in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it raining outside? Have I... fallen asleep?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sat up and looked at the time. It was past 3 AM.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For some reason, she threw back the covers, got out of bed, and went to the window. She pulled the curtains open again and looked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Grace herself could not quite explain why she was doing this. 'Am I doing this to see if Jason is still out there? It's so late now. He should have gone back to his room by now.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only when she looked out of the window that she saw that the tall figure was still standing on the edge of the lotus pond!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's... still there!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was instantly stunned.</p></div>
