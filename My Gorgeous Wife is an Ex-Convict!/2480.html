        <h1>Chapter 2478</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you doubting the police's investigation report, then?" Daley Moss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's one thing. Another is that I recall Herman asking why the car was so hot and whether there was something wrong with the air conditioning when he was driving. But I didn&rsquo;t feel so at that time. I thought that the car was cool enough, freezing even. Even if it&rsquo;s different for everyone, this is too significant.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, Amber Mitchell concluded, "I suspect someone might have spiked Herman's food so that his physical senses would react differently from normal.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you saying someone might have drugged him?" Daley Moss narrowed his eyes suspiciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That&rsquo;s all I can think of,&rdquo; said Amber Mitchell, who had spent years in the mental hospital reliving the accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss chuckled suddenly. "It was so many years ago. Why didn't you bring up such details after the accident but now? How am I supposed to believe you're not making this up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was so confused with everything that happened, and Herman... died trying to protect me. I just thought it was an accident. I didn't even want to recall it," answered Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then why did you recall it afterward?" Daley Moss asked sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought about many things when I was locked up in the mental hospital, but I thought about the car accident the most. I even dreamed about the accident countless times. I can even recite every word Herman said to me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was doubts about the car accident that had kept her from giving up her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because she still had to find out the truth about the car accident. She could not let the truth about Herman's death be hidden away just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss's face grew solemn. "Why didn't you say anything when you went to the cemetery that night? Why did you choose to say this now?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because most people didn&rsquo;t think I was normal yet before I went for the consultation. Today, the results were released that I&rsquo;m not mentally ill, so whatever I say can&rsquo;t be dismissed as me being crazy,&rdquo; replied Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, she knew she had nothing even if she was proven to be normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She might not be able to retrieve her shares smoothly. Besides that, she had no financial resources and had lost all her connections. Even if Kyla and Grace were willing to help her, they were based in Emerald City. In Deer City, the Moss family was her best choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss had always respected Herman and was committed to finding out the truth about his eldest brother's death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's comment got Daley Moss thinking. Grace, who was standing next to Amber Mitchell, said with a pale face, "Excuse me. Where's... the washroom?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, it's right at the end of the hallway," replied Whitney Herrera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Grace could even say thank you, she covered her mouth and hurried to the washroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Grace's back thoughtfully. Moments later, he also got up and walked over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera sighed to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that the crown prince had not gotten over Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, the crown prince would not have intervened in Amber Mitchell's case.</p></div>
