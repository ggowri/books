        <h1>Chapter 2544</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian touched his wet hair in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Can I ever withdraw my love for Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it too deep that I can&rsquo;t withdraw it? Or do I not want to withdraw it at all? Does Grace know I&rsquo;ll give up my life for her safety?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The trial for the car accident began. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell stood in the dock again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the Moss family did not announce the retrial, it was abuzz online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, unlike the Mitchell family's lawsuit, the Gregory family did not intervene this time. George Gregory did not even attend the trial, which made many people speculate whether the Gregory family was planning to fall out with the Mitchell family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were even reports that George Gregory was planning to divorce Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was not as lucky as the last time. This time, not only did the Gregory family not help Louise Mitchell but the witnesses and material evidence all pointed at Louise Mitchell, making Louise Mitchell's excuses useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was clear Louise Mitchell had already lost even though the trial had not reached its conclusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the last day of the trial, the judge convicted Louise Mitchell and confirmed that she was the mastermind of the accident and Sandra Lucas&rsquo;s murderer. She was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of political rights for life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell almost collapsed to the ground while shouting, "I... I'm not guilty. I was wronged. I was wronged..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only response she got was the Stephensonliff pressing her arms firmly and escorting her back to the police car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Louise Mitchell screamed in the direction of Amber Mitchell, "Louise Mitchell, you did this to me! You b*tch! You did this to me! Do you think the Moss family is going to treat you well? You'll only be worse off than me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked at Louise Mitchell, whose expression looked twisted and resentful. She was quite different from her arrogant self after the last court hearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's my business to decide whether I'm going to be well off or not, not yours. You're the one who did this to yourself! If you hadn't caused the car accident, how could this have happened to you today?" Amber Mitchell said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had nothing but hatred for her half-sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell shouted with a hideous expression, "You killed Herman Moss! If he hadn't tried to protect you, you would&rsquo;ve been the one who died instead of him! Amber Mitchell, you're the murderer! You're the killer! Why do I have to go to jail while you're free? Just wait. the Moss family will send you to jail next! You'll suffer more than when you were in the mental hospital!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to Louise Mitchell's excitement, Amber Mitchell only looked indifferently at the person in front of her. "Louise Mitchell, you'll spend the rest of your life in prison without any chance of commutation. You can only atone for the sins you committed for the rest of your life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she turned away from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She and Louise Mitchell would probably never see or interact with each other again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell, you b*tch! I'm not done with you. I'll wait for you in prison. I'll wait and see what happens to you..." Louise Mitchell continued shouting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Amber Mitchell did not look back as if the person behind her no longer mattered to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She walked out of the courtroom and faced the reporters who came over. Amber Mitchell got into the Moss family's car and returned to the Moss family&rsquo;s house with Daley Moss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not too late for you to back out," Daley Moss said suddenly.</p></div>
