        <h1>Chapter 2896</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In response to his pitch-black phoenix eyes, she couldn't help but reply, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After they finished strolling around the amusement park, Brian Hart drove Valda Theller back to the villa. "You can pack your things, and I'll have someone send you back to your apartment," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying this, Brian Hart didn't get out of the car. He simply drove away after Valda Theller got out of the car. He was afraid that if he stayed, he would regret letting her leave and would break his promise to keep her here by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It wasn't until his car disappeared from her sight that Valda Theller turned around and walked back into the house to start packing her things. One by one, her belongings were packed into her suitcase, and her presence in the villa diminished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she finished packing, someone came up to her and respectfully said, "Miss Theller, hello. Mrs. Hart asked me to send you home. Shall I help you with your luggage?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," Valda Theller politely replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she left, she couldn't help but turn around and take one last look at the villa. Perhaps she would never come back here again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda Theller returned to her apartment, she felt as if she had been transported to another world. Although she had only stayed at Brian Hart's villa for less than two weeks, it felt like a long time had passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, when Camille Strickland found out that Valda Theller had returned to her apartment, she came over and asked, "You're finally back. So, what's going on between you and Brian Hart? Have you made up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, we broke up," Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think there's such a thing as a fake breakup? We're not playing house," Valda Theller replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland sighed, "It's just a shame. After all, that's Brian Hart. How many women in the entertainment industry would love to have him? And he was good to you, wasn't he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He was good to me, but our feelings for each other were not strong enough to continue dating. These days, let's just consider it a dream. When the dream is over, we'll just have to figure out how to live our lives," Valda Theller said with a bitter smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, let's just live our lives," Camille Strickland said, looking at her friend's despondent face. She knew that her friend was not as carefree as she appeared on the surface.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But when it came to matters of the heart, it was not easy for outsiders to intervene. All she could do was silently support her friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, your manga adaptation will be finished next week, and the production team will invite you to the wrap party. Are you going?" Camille Strickland asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, her friend had some unpleasant experiences on the set, and Raymond Bowman was one of the sponsors of the production.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the day of the wrap party, Raymond Bowman might even show up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go," Valda Theller smiled. "It's my first manga adaptation wrap party. If I miss it, it won't be justifiable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, we'll go together," Camille Strickland said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After her friend left, Valda Theller's smile gradually faded. She slapped her cheeks hard and told herself that from today on, she had to pick herself up and become the independent and strong Valda Theller she used to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her reliance on Brian Hart had come to an end. From now on, she had to become the Valda Theller who didn't rely on anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">*****</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the following days, Valda Theller lived a monotonous life, shuttling between her home and studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her two assistants were well aware of the attack she had suffered at the convention, so they kept their heads down and focused on their work, not daring to say much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One day, while Valda Theller was working on sketches with her assistants, Rowena Santiago arrived at the studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the sight of Valda Theller, Rowena Santiago knelt down in front of her with a thud.</p></div>
