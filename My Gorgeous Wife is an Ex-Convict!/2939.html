        <h1>Chapter 2937</h1>
        <div><p>Patrick Weiss&#x27;s voice faltered, and now it was him who was feeling embarrassed. &quot;Haha... Grace, I hope you don&#x27;t mind,&quot; he chuckled nervously.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s okay, I actually already knew,&quot; Valda Theller&#x27;s eyelashes fluttered as she lowered her gaze. &quot;I know that Brian Hart loves Grace, and has loved her for many years. If Grace hadn&#x27;t married Jason Reed, then maybe Brian Hart would already be with her now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He&#x27;s just too stubborn when it comes to love. Once he&#x27;s made up his mind, he&#x27;ll stick to it,&quot; Patrick Weiss said.</p><p>Valda Theller&#x27;s face showed a bitter smile. Of course, but it was precisely his deep affection and stubbornness that made her unknowingly fall in love with Brian Hart while admiring Grace.</p><p>&quot;But,&quot; Patrick Weiss&#x27;s tone changed, &quot;you are the exception to his stubbornness in love all these years.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Exception?&quot; She was puzzled.</p><p>Patrick Weiss said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been friends with him for many years and have seen all the women who have come and gone in his life, but I&#x27;ve never seen him make an exception for anyone. It was because of his childhood encounter with Grace that he has been looking for her ever since they lost contact. His previous girlfriends were only considered substitutes because they resembled Grace in appearance, but even so, he never had any intimate actions with those women.&quot;</p><p>Substitutes? Valda Theller&#x27;s eyes flickered.</p><p>&quot;He is both deeply affectionate and ruthless. For those he doesn&#x27;t care about, even if you die in front of him, he will remain indifferent. Grace is the one who led him into a dead end, but you are the one who is slowly pulling him out of it,&quot; Patrick Weiss said, looking at Valda Theller.</p><p>Valda Theller said bitterly, &quot;You think too highly of me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s not about whether I think highly of you or not, it&#x27;s the truth. For so many years, you are the only woman who can make him laugh and feel sad. He will be restless for you, happy because of your phone call, and even get drunk because of breaking up with you, and even hug me and talk nonsense,&quot; <span style="color:#222222"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="background-color:#ffffff">Patrick Weiss</span></span></span> sighed. &quot;All of these things, can&#x27;t they prove something? Even your appearance has nothing to do with Grace. Even if he considers you a substitute for Grace, this reason cannot hold. In my opinion, his feelings for you may be far more than he thinks. Valda Theller, can&#x27;t you be with Brian Hart?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I...,&quot; Valda Theller bit her lip. &quot;I broke up with him because... I feel like I can never replace Grace in his heart. In the future, he will definitely find someone he can truly love, but that&#x27;s not something I can do.&quot;</p><p>She had tried her best, but the result was still a failure. An accident, his turning away, was enough to prove it!</p><p>&quot;Do you really think you can never replace her?&quot; Patrick Weiss asked. &quot;Then let me ask you, how long have you known Brian Hart? And how many years do you know that Brian Hart has loved Grace?&quot;</p><p>Valda Theller was stunned.</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;ve only known Brian Hart for less than a year, but Brian Hart&#x27;s feelings for Grace have been more than 20 years. In less than a year, you have already made Brian Hart care so much about you. So if time goes on, do you still think you can&#x27;t replace her? I don&#x27;t think so!&quot;</p></div>
