        <h1>Chapter 3700</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Look at what our family has become after you fell out with Mason. If it weren't for you, the Barlow family's business wouldn't be in such a state. Your brother wouldn't have missed out on the best high school in Emerald City. If this continues, we don't even know if he'll be able to go to college!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Barlow family's business is failing because you don't have the ability to run a business. Your brother can't get into a good high school because of his own academic problems," Veronica spoke frankly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer was furious and raised his hand to slap his daughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica dodged the slap and said, "Dad, if you're here to hit me, I'll call the police!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside, she was submissive to survive, but she didn't want to accept all the blame from her unreasonable family members at home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, okay!" Rosalind, the stepmother, quickly acted as a peacemaker. "Your father came here today to invite you to a dinner party in a few days. It's also a kind gesture. He thinks you're at the age where you should be dating and wants you to meet some young men at the party. There will be many talented young people there, and it will expand your network, which will also help your future career."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Veronica politely declined, "I don't want to attend any dinner parties, Auntie Rosalind. I appreciate your kindness, but right now I just want to work hard and finish my studies."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You--" Archer's face turned red with anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this, Rosalind pulled her husband's sleeve and said to Veronica, "Since that's the case, your father and I will leave first. Rest well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she immediately pulled Archer out of Veronica's room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as they left, Archer said, "Why did you pull me out? She clearly said she wanted to see Veronica!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you keep talking like that, she'll only become more cautious. Anyway, I have a way to make her obediently come to the dinner party." Rosalind's eyes flickered as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Archer immediately felt relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good. You must make sure that girl comes to the dinner party, otherwise that business deal will be ruined."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will!" Rosalind smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, inside the room, Veronica took out Mason's suit from her bag and held it tightly to her chest. It was as if the suit was her last support.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, she was all alone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike before, even if she was feeling down, she had Mason by her side, and they had a feeling of mutual reliance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, she had no one to rely on!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Two days later, after finishing her classes, Veronica was on her way to work when Rosalind stopped her outside the school gates.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Auntie Rosalind?" Veronica looked at her in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your father had an accident. You and I need to go see him right away." Rosalind said urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An accident? What happened?" Veronica asked quickly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At today's dinner party, your father spoke carelessly and offended someone. He's now being held there, and I...I'm at a loss. The other party said they must see you before they'll release him," Rosalind said.</span></p></div>
