        <h1>Chapter 3229</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long after, Grace and Jasper returned to the main hall. They were accompanied by a slightly shorter and slender young boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little boy is wearing a plain T-shirt and looks a bit pale and thin, but his facial features are very good. With proper care, he should grow up to be a very handsome child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Auntie Valda, this is Lawrence!" Jasper introduced, then turned to Lawrence and said, "This is Auntie Valda, she's a really talented comic artist. I have a lot of drawings that Auntie Valda made for me, I'll show you later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Auntie Valda is good," Lawrence whispered, looking a bit nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda smiled and said, "Hello Lawrence. I'm sorry I didn't know you were coming today, so I didn't prepare a gift for you. How about this? I'll prepare a gift for you next time and have Jasper give it to you on my behalf. Is that okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence looked surprised and widened his eyes, as if he didn't expect to receive a gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, Lawrence, could you play a song for Auntie Valda? I really want more people to hear your piano playing, they will definitely like it!" said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could Lawrence refuse those hopeful apricot eyes looking up at him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he was worried that others might not appreciate his piano playing as much as she did, since he had never really studied it, and he had heard her play before, which made him feel inferior compared to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at this moment, he didn't want to disappoint her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Lawrence nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper pulled Lawrence over to a white piano that was placed on one side of the main hall and opened the lid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence sat down cautiously in front of the piano. It was so beautiful, even more so than the most expensive piano he had ever seen in the music store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And when his fingertips touched the piano keys, the flowing music that poured out was just as beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wants to perform well and not disappoint Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence took a deep breath, sat up straight, and his fingers began to glide over the piano keys. Beautiful notes flowed from his fingertips, one after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda listened to the sound of the piano, even though she didn't have much knowledge about it and couldn't judge whether it was good or bad, she could feel the infectious power of the music.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound of this child's piano playing will slowly immerse the listener into the music. Just then, Jason and Brian came downstairs. When Brian saw the unfamiliar little boy playing the piano, he was momentarily surprised, but then he seemed to understand and quietly asked Jason, "Is this the one we're looking for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's definitely something Jasper would like," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Brian didn't pursue music, as a wealthy child, he naturally had some knowledge in the field. Therefore, he could tell the quality of the music being played and knew where Jasper liked to play.</p></div>
