        <h1>Chapter 688</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were already a lot of people gathered on Grace's side. With that scream, more people gathered around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned slightly. The next moment, he pulled Grace into a parked car and drove away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car just sped off, leaving the crowd of people who had gathered there unable to do nothing but stare. Then, they began to discuss Grace and Brian&rsquo;s relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting into the car, Grace said to Brian, "Thank you for just now. Just drop me off somewhere around here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, instead of stopping the car, Brian asked, "What the hell is going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Some stranger recognized me. After all, my recent case reversal became hot internet gossip because of Lily's apology. Please stop the car. My friend&rsquo;s still in the bookstore and I have to meet her later!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pressed his thin lips together slightly and finally pulled up to the side of the road.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace tried to get out of the car, but Brian stopped her. "It's only 300 meters away from the bookstore's entrance. Maybe those people will catch up with you and surround you again. You might as well contact your friend and only get off once she's here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She nodded hesitantly at that. Then, her eyes fell on Brian's hand which was still holding her arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's fingers tightened slightly before he slowly let go. Grace took her phone out of her bag and called Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, I got into some trouble just now. I'm outside at the Jayhui Building in front of the bookstore, about 300 meters away. Just come over&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian, who was sitting beside her, looked at the person close at hand in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Earlier when he drove past the neighborhood, he immediately caught sight of her in the crowd. It was as if he could spot her immediately even if she was doing nothing but standing in the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every time he looked at her, his eyes, his heart, and his blood flow seemed to all go out of control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At first, he had thought she was the one he was looking for. As long as he found evidence, she would not be able to deny it. However, the more he looked for evidence, the more proof he got that the person he had been looking for was someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The one I should treat well is Stella, not her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he had been repeating this to himself over and over again, when he saw that she was in trouble, he immediately got out of the car and walked over to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The empty feeling in his palm was more obvious!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian slowly gathered his hands and dropped them to his sides. "When are you and Jason getting married? I'll attend the wedding dinner and give you a nice gift. After all, you're Stella's cousin."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Probably a year from now. I want to mourn for my grandmother this year." After a pause, she added, "Also, you don't need to be extra nice to me because of Stella. Although Stella and I are cousins, we aren't that close. I&rsquo;ve never given her any help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's thin lips were almost pressed into a straight line, and the car fell into an awkward silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment, his eyes fell on the two law books in her lap. "Are you planning to get back into law?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I plan to, but it depends on whether I have the ability to," said Grace. However, the longing in her eyes silently stated how much she wanted to be a lawyer again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was in a daze for a while. The person in front of him was clearly not the one, but why did she look so similar? Even the look in her eyes right now looked like the girl&rsquo;s who he held in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;She&rsquo; had once solemnly said to him, "I got the best grades in my class. Grandma said that only with good grades can I do what I want to do when I grow up."</p></div>
