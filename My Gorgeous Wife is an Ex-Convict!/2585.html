        <h1>Chapter 2583</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt a sudden surge of frustration mingled with uneasiness. It was a feeling she could not describe. However, she instinctively walked to keep up with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if her subconscious was deciding for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to be kept in the dark. If there was something she was supposed to know, she wanted to know!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took Kyla to the floor the inpatient hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery department was on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you bring me here?" Kyla asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll find out in a moment," Grace said as she walked to the attending doctor's office. As soon as the doctor saw Grace, they immediately came forward and said, "Mrs. Reed, you're here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, As I told you the last time, I hope you can tell her the whole story of her labor," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla recognized the doctor as well. He was a leading specialist in hepatobiliary. There was too much burden on her liver when she was pregnant, so she had a specialist consultation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor was, of course, one of the specialists she consulted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." the doctor said, looking troubled. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're worried about Martin Weiss, you don't have to. I know he told you not to tell her, but I'm the one who told her. The reason why I want you to describe the events truthfully is that I think it&rsquo;ll be more objective. Besides, you&rsquo;re the most relevant witness," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor hesitated slightly before saying, "Alright. I think Miss Corbyn needs to know too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... is it that I need to know?" Kyla asked as her lips quivered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had a feeling that what the doctor was about to say would be a big deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, Miss Corbyn, you did more than just give birth. You also had a second liver transplant," the doctor said slowly. Their voice was calm, but it was like a thunderbolt to Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's pupils constricted instantly. 'A second liver transplant? What does that mean? Does that mean I have a different liver now? But I have a special blood type, so whose liver is it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A figure flashed across her mind. Then, her breathing became heavy. She could hear the doctor's voice going on...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"After your C-section, we found that your liver was already in poor condition. If you didn't get a second liver transplant and continued using the original liver, you might not live longer than a year. Mr. Martin Weiss volunteered to donate his liver. He was also prepared for the surgery as he was on an empty stomach. He had also completed all the preoperative tests, so we immediately performed a second liver transplant on you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla listened to everything in a daze. She almost could not believe it. She thought she only did a C-section but did not expect to have done a liver transplant too. Martin Weiss... donated his liver to her a second time. How big of a burden would it be for him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... What about Martin Weiss? Is... Is he alright?" Kyla asked in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The operation was successful, but there's bound to be some strain on his body as he has donated his liver twice. It&rsquo;ll also affect his life. His health will worsen, and he needs to check his liver regularly every six months. But we've told Mr. Weiss about these consequences before. He was well aware of them and had mentally prepared for them," the doctor said.</p></div>
