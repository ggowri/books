        <h1>Chapter 1594</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Young master Reed had called him to the office today. However, the man was not saying anything now that he was in front of him and just stared at him. Terrence had no idea what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is he having a conflict with Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">While Terrence speculated, Jason asked, "Do you really not know why Grace left me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence almost choked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young master Reed... Why are you suddenly asking me that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Didn't you say she left me because of that case with Jennifer?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That was only my guess, but I&rsquo;m not Young Madam, after all. It's just speculation. Uh... speculation." Terrence was sweating profusely. "But Young Madam doesn't remember why she left either. Come to think of it, maybe... it's not what we speculated. When Young Madam came back, she also said she&rsquo;s forgiven you after learning the truth about the case."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Forgiven?" Jason sneered. 'Yes, she did forgive me, but she couldn&rsquo;t stand my touch. She even threw up non-stop when I touched her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is that what you call forgiveness?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Or had she not forgiven me at all? Did she misunderstand that she had forgiven me just because she doesn't remember?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Please contact Dr. Joseph from abroad and ask him to come to Emerald City. But don't make it public and don't tell Grace about it either," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence was stunned. 'If my memory serves me right, Dr. Joseph's a foreign expert on memories and has published many theses on people with memory loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is Young master Reed going to...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you planning to recover your memory?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah," Jason answered lightly. He had restored most of his memories, so what remained was only a tiny fraction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, those memories were the ones that mattered most to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But Dr. Guzman also said you&rsquo;ll be overwhelmed if you want to use something like hypnosis to recover your memory, Young master Reed. Before you recover your memories, you might break down first,&rdquo; Terrence said with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was why they never said anything about her falling into the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Grace was back. In Terrence's opinion, it did not matter whether Young master Reed recovered his memory or not. After all, Young master Reed was still treating Grace the same way he had before he lost his memory. It had never changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's why I want to see Dr. Joseph. There's always a way if I want to recover my memories," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But... why don&rsquo;t you do it step by step? Young Madam has now returned. Maybe you'll recall some of the past after spending time with her, and your memory will naturally recover," said Terrence. This was the best they could hope for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't want to wait!" Jason said firmly. It was because he was afraid that the later he recovered his memory, the more variables there would be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He just wanted to know why Grace left him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence's face was full of embarrassment. Young master Reed was determined to recover his memory, but the truth of what happened back then... He was in a dilemma about whether to tell him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, they had been hiding it from him. Even if he told him, Young master Reed might not believe him and he might be furious instead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Young master Reed did not want him to tell anyone about finding Dr. Joseph. In other words, he could not even discuss it with someone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, you can head out. I want to be alone," said Jason.</p></div>
