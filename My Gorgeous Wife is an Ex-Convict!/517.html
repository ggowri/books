        <h1>Chapter 516</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It's rare for Grace to hear Jason call someone a friend, so Patrick was probably close to him. "Hello, I'm Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace introduced herself gracefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, I've wanted to meet you for a long time now, but I haven&rsquo;t had a chance," Patrick said with a smile. After all, he had always been curious about the woman who managed to capture his best friend's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the eve of the Lunar New Year, Patrick was shocked and intrigued by the fact that his best friend brought a group of police officers to the town next to Emerald City for her. He even left Old Master Reed behind for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, after meeting Grace, Patrick thought that even though she was not stunningly beautiful, her eyes gave people a sense of comfort&mdash;it was gentle and relaxing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Standing alongside Grace, Jason also seemed more relaxed than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick immediately understood why his best friend fell in love with Grace. People like them were often in a treacherous environment where the people around them were more hypocritical than sincere. Although they were high up in the pecking order, the slightest mistake might cause them to fall and break into pieces. Therefore, even if one looked relaxed most of the time, they were actually tense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's calm temperament could make others feel relaxed, and that made it all the more precious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, when I came over, there were some people over there discussing the internet situation this year. You want to get involved?" Patrick asked Jason. As soon as he mentioned the names of the people in the discussion, she immediately recognized them as internet bigwigs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These were people she would not normally get to meet, but now, they were at the same banquet as her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was obviously interested as soon as he heard what his friend said, but then he turned and looked at Grace. "Do you want to join?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I won't understand what they're talking about anyway. Why don't you go? I'll just rest here," answered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right." Jason nodded. "About the food..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take some myself, don't worry," Grace said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick looked at the proud friend he had known since childhood in shock. Jason was now acting like her mother, telling Grace not to take the wine because of its strong alcohol content, to be careful when she walked so that she would not fall, and even to ask the waiter to get the food for her if she did not want to get it herself...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick almost thought the person in front of him was only someone who looked like Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that Jason was so afraid of Grace choking on her food and falling on her feet that he wished he could hold her in the palm of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If others saw this, their eyes would probably pop out. When had Emerald City's most difficult Young Master Reed treated a woman this way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like he wanted to wait on the woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the two men walked away from Grace, Patrick said, "I&rsquo;ve never seen you treat a woman this way. Are you serious about her?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Jason admitted it readily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick's eyes immediately widened at his confession. "You mean it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason glanced at him. "Do I have to tell you a lie?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gulp!</p></div>
