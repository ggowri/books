        <h1>Chapter 3061</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the detention center of Deer Capital, Brian saw Phoebe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to the well-dressed Miss Cross from the affluent Cross family in the past, Phoebe now looks disheveled with messy hair, wrinkled clothes, and rough skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Long time no see, Brian," Phoebe said with a gentle smile as she looked at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian wanted nothing more than to cut this woman in a thousand pieces, his eyes filled with intense hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe seems oddly satisfied with these hateful eyes. "Since we were young, I always thought you were very cold, indifferent to people, and distant. It's as if no one can enter your heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe spoke slowly, "Later on, I found out that there was someone in your heart, someone who had saved you when you were young."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You love Grace, I know. Who made me unable to save you when we were young? Later, Grace married Jason, so I waited for you, hoping that one day you could love me. But... why would you rather give a chance to Valda, a worthless woman, instead of giving me a chance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I, Phoebe, what aspect am I inferior to Valda? Why can Valda be your girlfriend, but not me? And even...you're willing to destroy the Cross family for Valda?! You've left me with nothing for the sake of Valda, what's so great about her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Phoebe spoke, her emotions became more and more intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you said enough?" Brian asked, looking at Phoebe with a gaze of disgust and bone-chilling hatred. "I only have one question for you: Did you intend for Valda to die when you chose to have her trade the password?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What, do you want to know?" Phoebe laughed, "Since I'm seeing you today, it's only natural that I'll tell you everything you want to know!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From the beginning, my goal was to make Valda pay the price. Money was just an extra thing. I wanted to find Whitney so that I could successfully kidnap Grace's child. Choosing Valda's password was to give her the choice of who would survive between herself and Grace's child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"After all, Grace is the woman you love the most. If she lets this child die to protect herself, you will never forgive her in your lifetime. Moreover, you will be consumed by endless self-blame. Your relationship with her will only become extremely bad. Even if she survives, she will only be living in hell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But if she chooses to let the child live and die herself, then she won't have the chance to be with you anymore. Even if she was arrogant in front of me before, in the end, she will still drown and get nothing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe suddenly burst into laughter, as if she was admiring her own wonderful plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Actually, I had hoped that she would abandon the child and save herself. That way, she would experience the feeling of being hated by you. You might even want to kill her. I would like to see if she can still laugh at that time," Phoebe said with a hint of regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Brian lunged forward and leaned over the table, grabbing Phoebe's head with one hand and pressing it firmly onto the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Phoebe, you're asking for trouble!" Brian gritted his teeth and said through them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe's face was almost distorted from the pressure, but she still struggled to speak, "Are you angry? Do you hate me? Haha, Brian, even though I can't have your love, I still... have your hatred, don't I? But what did Valda get? You don't love her, you don't hate her, she lost her life and got nothing!"</p></div>
