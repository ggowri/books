        <h1>Chapter 2099</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He pressed his thin lips together tightly while his deep eyes stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Their eyes were locked on each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a long time, he said, "As long as Chase Harper doesn't mess with me, I'll leave him alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would always give in when it came to her, and then... lose terribly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla breathed a sigh of relief. Finally, he would leave Chase Harper alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, I'll leave Chase Harper alone. Can you keep the baby too?" Martin Weiss's voice rang in the room again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's expression froze. She bit her lip and said, "You can have lots of children if you want to. You don't have to cling on to this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss smiled bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Yeah, I can have lots of children if I want to, but they won&rsquo;t be hers and mine!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'All I want is to have children of our own!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So you still won't keep the baby?" he asked as he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She took a deep breath. "Martin Weiss, I've made up my mind, and you know that I won't change my decisions easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's because I&rsquo;ve hurt you too deeply, isn't it? So even though you said you'll forgive me, you still hate me and don't even want this child to have a chance in the world?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was silent because she did not know what to answer him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What if I were to suffer the same wounds and pain? Could you give birth to the child then?" he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze as she looked at the man in front of her in confusion, wondering what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she found out the next moment. She stared blankly at him, looking shocked as blood oozed from his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What are you doing?" Kyla asked as she watched the blood soak through the fabric on his arm before dripping onto the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss murmured, "I&rsquo;ve come to pay for the wounds and pain you endured in the past... I will suffer what you suffered back then... Will that make you want to have the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said as he ruthlessly cut himself again with the dagger he held in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Suddenly, he had another wound dripping with blood...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, stop it! Stop it!" Kyla shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he only looked straight at her. "Promise me you won't kill the baby, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, he cut himself again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if he was telling her that he would keep hurting himself if she did not say yes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, why are you forcing me? You'll only end up dead if you do this!" said Kyla as something seemed to press against her chest. It was so heavy that she could hardly breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I know I'm despicable, but I don't know how else to make up for what I did and persuade you to keep the baby..." Martin Weiss looked down in self-mockery, "If you really don't want this baby, then... Perhaps it's not a bad thing that I'll bleed out like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her pupils constricted instantly. 'Does he... want to die?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You gave me my life in the first place. I would have died long ago if it had not been for your bone marrow. There&rsquo;s no harm in giving it back to you now," muttered Martin Weiss.</p></div>
