        <h1>Chapter 2918</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she locked the car door, she understood that it was only temporary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her gaze fell on a figure and her pupils shrank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Brian Hart! He had arrived!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart walked up to the car and looked at Phoebe Cross inside. He coldly ordered his men to "smash" the car window with iron bars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross was so scared that she trembled and instinctively curled up under the seat. In just a moment, the car window was shattered and the door was opened. Phoebe Cross was dragged out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Phoebe Cross, you are persistent. Do you still want to deal with Valda Theller?" Brian Hart said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only at this moment that Phoebe Cross finally regained her senses from the shock. She looked up and saw the stack of photos in Brian Hart's hand. She suddenly laughed, "Haha, you've seen these photos. That's good. I bought them to show you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Show me?" Brian Hart narrowed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I want you to see that Valda Theller, whom you care about, has feelings for another man, Raymond Bowman. He was her first love, and they were very close. That day, Raymond Bowman even said something that could ruin his own reputation for Valda Theller. She was probably moved and wanted to be with him..." Phoebe Cross's sharp voice kept ringing out, and every word she said was a stimulus to Brian Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shut up!" Brian Hart suddenly shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haha..." Phoebe Cross refused to be silenced, "Brian Hart, you trampled on my love for you. Now let's see how other women trample on your feelings. You are willing to destroy The Cross Family for Valda Theller, but she will still find other men to be with. Even if she stays by your side, she still has Raymond Bowman in her heart. In the end, you are just a joke, Brian Hart..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross's voice suddenly stopped. Brian Hart's slender fingers had already pinched her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross suddenly felt difficulty breathing. She opened her mouth to scream, but couldn't make a complete sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she saw in his eyes was a murderous, bloodthirsty gaze that she had never seen before. It was cold, fierce, and filled with a kind of crazy killing intent, but it was all shrouded in an invisible layer of pain...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was this... Brian Hart? Was this the same Brian Hart she knew, who was always indifferent and aloof?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when he couldn't get Grace's love back then, she had never seen him show such a look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And now, this look was because of Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could it be... Brian Hart really fell in love with Valda Theller?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross's breathing became more and more difficult, and all she could hear was Brian Hart's cold voice, "I want you... to stop talking!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That voice... was like the voice of death!</p></div>
