        <h1>Chapter 1230</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence defended himself a little and gave Jason a way out of this awkward situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason rubbed his forehead. Yes, he had been so busy yesterday that he did not have time to check his email. He thought that since he was coming here for a detailed examination today, it did not matter whether he read the diagnosis. Unexpectedly, she was carrying triplets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's shocked eyes looked at Grace's belly. 'There are three babies... in that flat belly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'We're... going to have three babies instead of one?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace also looked at her belly in shock. She was in extreme... disbelief!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Triplets?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even with only one child, she already felt that it was a treasure given to her by God.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, God was giving her three treasures?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tears welled up in her eyes at this unexpected fact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you crying?" Jason frowned as he looked at the tears in Grace's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm just so happy... I really have three babies, right?" she cried out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"'We&rsquo; have three children." He corrected her as he took the tissue from Terrence and gently wiped the tears on her face. "Alright, stop crying. Crying too much isn't good for the babies."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He spoke with a somewhat stiff tone. He found himself always at a loss when he saw her tears. Even his hand was a little stiff as he wiped her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace tried hard to hold back her tears at that. She was now a mother who desperately hoped the babies in her belly were alright!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor did various tests on Grace, but their brows were furrowed all the time. Their face was grave, especially during her ultrasound scan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Doctor, are the babies... okay?" asked Grace, whose main concern at the moment was the three babies in her womb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three children seemed to have added new hope to her already gloomy life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor replied, "The babies are doing okay, but you're not doing so well. You&rsquo;ve injured your womb before, so having three babies is a bit too much for your body. I'm going to recommend a pregnancy reduction."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Pregnancy reduction?" Grace's pupils immediately shrunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor was done with the ultrasound scan. As they put away the ultrasound equipment, they said, "Yes, pregnancy reduction. We usually recommend the average pregnant woman to undergo a pregnancy reduction as well if they&rsquo;re having three babies, not to mention a pregnant woman under your circumstances.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace naturally knew what it meant to have a pregnancy reduction. It meant killing a little life in her belly to stop the baby from growing and dying... in the way it was now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you're 13 weeks pregnant, so you've missed the best time for pregnancy reduction. The risks are much higher if you want to do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What kind of risk?" Jason, who had been silent all along, suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor replied, "In the worst case, it could lead to a miscarriage. Of course, the odds are slim if we&rsquo;re the ones doing the surgery."</p></div>
