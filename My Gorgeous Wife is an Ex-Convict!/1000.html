        <h1>Chapter 999</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what? Who I want to be with is my business, right?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Cough&hellip; Cough..." Old Master Reed seemed a little displeased. He stirred a little and coughed. After a long pause, he asked, "Do you want to repeat your father's mistakes that much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you think Grace might kill me too?" Jason asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed was silent. After a while, he suddenly said, "That boy from the Hart family has fallen for that woman too. He doesn't know that Grace is the one he has been looking for. What do you think your chances are if he finds out? Isn't he part of the reason why you chose to break up? You're afraid Grace would betray you because of him, aren't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared at Old Master Reed. One could say that the person who knew him best in the world was actually the old man in front of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just have to keep her from betraying me, right?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"One&rsquo;s heart is the most unpredictable thing. Do you think you have control over whether someone will betray you or not?" said Old Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pursed his lips and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed continued with great earnestness, "That woman will destroy you! My days are numbered. I don't want a woman to ruin the Reed family after my death."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't lay a hand on her." Jason stood up, walked to the bedside, and looked down at the old man from a commanding position. "If you touch her even a little, then I'll ruin the Reed family before you die. You don't even have to wait till your demise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Old Master Reed glared at his grandson, but he could feel that he was not joking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is the heir I trained willing to risk the entire Reed family for a woman?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay... Okay... Cough..." Old Master Reed suddenly laughed. "Okay, I won't touch her, but sooner or later, you'll know that I&rsquo;m only like this for you and the Reed family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Rest well. You don't need to worry about the Reed family and me," Jason said coldly before turning around to leave the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed turned his head to his secretary and said, "If Jay and Grace get back together one day, then do what I told you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Got it," answered the secretary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed sighed, lay down again, and closed his eyes slowly. 'One will only face destruction if they love someone too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I did all these things to make sure that the Reed family can live long and prosper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Love ruined my son, and I can&rsquo;t let it ruin the heir I trained!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace met with Kyla, Nelson, and Lina on Sunday, mainly for Nelson's kindergarten issue. Hadwin was also there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla thanked Lina repeatedly as soon as she knew that she was the one who asked Hadwin to help Nelson find a kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, don't mention it," said Lina as she waved her hand. All she could think about was the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's... exactly what Grace described. He's more handsome and cuter than in the photos. My heart will melt if I have such a son!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina bent down and said to Nelson, "I'll be overjoyed if you hug me and give me a kiss!"</p></div>
