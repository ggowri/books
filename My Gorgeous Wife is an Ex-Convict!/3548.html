        <h1>Chapter 3546</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yesterday, you asked me if I was Lawrence, right? So, do I look like him?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"To be precise, you have some resemblance to him when he was a child. He went missing when he was only 10 years old, and your appearance is like what he would have looked like when he grew up," Jasper said. "That's why I asked you if you were Lawrence at that time, because... he also played Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige, and your interpretation of the piece is somewhat similar to his."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I am not Lawrence," Roger said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know you're not," she said, a hint of sadness flashing in her eyes. "Maybe it's because I miss him so much that I can't help but look at you a little longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Perhaps he doesn't look like me when he grows up," he said. "As you said, your memory of him is just his 10-year-old self."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She gave a self-deprecating smile. "Yes, maybe he doesn't look like you, but..." She took a deep breath and looked straight into his eyes. "Can you let me have a good look at you? I won't come to bother you again in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pursed his lips and didn't say anything, but he didn't walk away either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So... does that mean he agreed? Jasper wondered to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, on a small path beside the library, a man and a woman stood facing each other. She looked at him quietly and seriously, as if she wanted to deeply imprint his appearance in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He, on the other hand, remained silent and let her look at him like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, her gaze met his. His deep, black eyes were so calm that...he couldn't possibly be Lawrence, could he?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Lawrence saw her, how could he be so calm?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Have you seen enough?" A cold voice rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you," Jasper said. Just as she was about to look away, her gaze swept over his neck and she froze. Suddenly, she leaned in close to him, pressing her hands on his shoulders and bringing her face towards his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On his neck, there was a small mole. In her memory, Lawrence also had a mole like this on his neck!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Jasper was lost in thought, she was suddenly pushed away by Roger. She stumbled back a few steps before regaining her balance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Please, Reed, watch your behavior!" Roger said, intending to walk past Jasper and leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you really not Lawrence?" Jasper anxiously grabbed onto him and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've already told you, I'm not! Didn't you just say that you knew I wasn't? Why are you asking such a ridiculous question again?" he said impatiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you have the same mole on your neck in the same place as Lawrence!" Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger's eyes flickered slightly, "In this world, people can have similarities, even moles can be similar. What's so strange about it? Do you really think that just because of a mole, I must be Lawrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to say something else, but he interrupted her, "I know who I am better than you do, so I hope you won't insist on saying that I'm someone else in front of me again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, he forcefully shook off her hand and left on his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper stood still, staring blankly at the other's back, lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was that person really not Lawrence? But why were there so many coincidences? One after another, these coincidences made it impossible for her to ignore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Regardless, she had to figure out whether or not he was Lawrence!</p></div>
