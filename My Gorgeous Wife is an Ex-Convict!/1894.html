        <h1>Chapter 1892</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, her hand still grabbed his wrist firmly even though she was choking. It was as if she was afraid he would go back in once she loosened her grip and the gate would prevent her from seeing him again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason slightly glanced down at her slightly deformed hand as it gripped his wrist. Then, he looked at her face that was flushed from the choking. Something flickered in his dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You don't have to grab me like that. I'll get things straight with you now that I see you," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace finally recovered and looked up at Jason. There were tears in her almond-shaped eyes because she had choked so hard just now. "Then... let's go inside and talk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, her hand still did not let go of his wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He pursed his thin lips, looked away, and went straight inside. She quickly followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was not until the two figures were gone that the security guards at the gate heaved a long breath. 'They're finally gone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But Young master Reed seemed indifferent... toward Young Madam! What happened between her and Young master Reed?' The security guards could not help wondering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace followed Jason to the old mansion's pond. The lotus flowers looked more elegant and ethereal in the morning sunlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, her face paled at the sight of the place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She remembered it as the spot she had knelt in front of him. She had knelt to beg him to let her go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Afterward, he and she became strangers. It was not until Lina was badly injured that she went to see him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Did he bring me here to...' A feeling of uneasiness suddenly seized her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You wanted to see me. Well, now you are. So? What do you want?" he asked, looking at her coldly as he pulled her hand away from his wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace bit her lip hard. "I... I came to apologize! And to beg your forgiveness," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason sneered a little and did not look at Grace but the pond full of lotus flowers. "I told you I won't forgive you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His words stung her like countless long needles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was not even looking at her. It made her feel as if she were nothing to him. It was as if she no longer existed in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her dangling hands clenched at her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not want him to be cold and indifferent to her! Taking a deep breath, Grace suddenly strode over to Jason, grabbed both sides of his cheeks, and forced him to look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, if you're angry with me, you can scold me and even punch me several times. You can even tell me what to do so you&rsquo;ll forgive me. But don't ignore me and cast me aside! We're husband and wife. Are you trying to divorce me by doing this?" Grace growled.</p></div>
