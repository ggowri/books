        <h1>Chapter 968</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No buts! I'm not a philanthropist. Besides, I'm not the driver responsible for the car accident. If I donate and pay for the accident, then anyone who's injured will start approaching me!" Elise Dean said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elise Dean was about to leave when Chase Harper unconsciously grabbed Elise Dean. "Miss Dean&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me go!" Elise Dean shouted, and Elise Dean's assistant quickly pushed Chase Harper away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper stumbled a little before regaining his footing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elise Dean glared at Chase Harper, ordering the film set's security guard, "Don't let these two people enter the set again. Jeez. They made me lose my mood!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, miss,&rdquo; the security guards repeatedly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that today had been a waste of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was about to leave with Chase Harper, she found Chase Harper staring at Elise Dean's back in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop staring. Let's go," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait... I remember the woman wearing the same ring that night!" Chase Harper said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. Suddenly, something flashed through her mind, but she could not grasp it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper scratched his head in embarrassment and said, "Oh, why did I say that? It doesn't matter whether she's wearing it or not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, they walked toward the parking lot. When they reached an empty lot, Chase Harper said, "Why don't you wait here for me? I'll go get my car and drive over here to pick you up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," answered Grace. After Chase Harper left, she lowered her head and thought about the case again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered hearing the staff talk about Elise Dean's ring when she came to inquire Elise Dean about the case last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She reputedly spent a lot of money on it, so Elise Dean was wary not to let others handle it. Elise Dean did not like the fake ruby ring prepared by the props crew, so she used her ring to film.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered that Chase Harper's dashcam did not capture who was driving the car, but from the video, she saw a red dot flashing on the nearby residence&rsquo;s window the moment Baldwin's car accident happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the red dot was a light spot refracted by the ruby, could the location and angle of the refracted light spot be used to recreate the crime scene and determine whether the person wearing the ring was sitting in the driver's seat or the passenger seat?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If that could be proven, then the chain of evidence would be clearer. After all, based on common sense, Elise Dean would never have given that assistant such a precious ring to wear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Elise Dean was thin with long and slender fingers, while the assistant was tall and chubby with thick fingers. She might not be able to wear Elise Dean's ring at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more Grace thought about it, the more excited she became. All of a sudden, she felt hopeful about her case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took out her phone and called Lawyer Carter, planning to tell him her new findings. "Lawyer Carter, I've thought of a new key point in the case that may prove Elise Dean was the driver that night..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace spoke excitedly, unaware that there was a man behind her holding a spray can toward her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Chase Harper drove there, he did not see Grace. He called her phone but failed to get through. He started panicking.</p></div>
