        <h1>Chapter 1391</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the weekend the next day and Nelson did not have to go to the kindergarten. Kyla Corbyn said to her mother, "Mom, I'll accompany Nelson to the small park nearby so he can play a little."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you get more sleep and have some rest?" asked Mrs. Corbyn. On weekends, she usually took her grandson to play in the park near their community in the morning because her daughter had to set up her food stall in the evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I want to spend more time with Nelson," said Kyla Corbyn. Now, every minute was precious to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn sighed. "Okay then. I'll prepare lunch and wait for you at home. I'll cook some of your favorite dishes later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." Kyla Corbyn smiled faintly and led her son out the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many parents would take their children out to the park near their community on weekends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson usually played with other children in the park, but instead of playing with other children his age today, he stood beside Kyla Corbyn all throughout. He looked worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Aren't you going to play?" Kyla Corbyn asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy... you're not a bad person, right?" The little one hesitated for a moment before finally asking. The events in the private room yesterday had left a great impact on the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn knew her son was only four years old, but he could understand a lot of what the adults said and could perceive them on his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Crouching down, she said, "Yes, I'm not a bad person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She fixed her eyes on her son's young and tender face. Nelson looked like Martin Weiss, but his eyes were like hers. Especially when Nelson smiled, he looked like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had rarely smiled over the years because of the hardships of life, but she hoped her son could smile more and not bear a huge emotional burden because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson, keep what I say in mind. I&rsquo;ve never hurt anyone. I did go to prison, but it doesn't mean I'm a bad person. I was wrongly convicted. Aunt Grace is a lawyer, and her job is to clear the names of those wrongly convicted and let the law give them justice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson blinked. "Then... Will Aunt help you clear your name?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said gently, "Aunt has been trying to help me, but I was wrongly convicted a long time ago so it's hard to find evidence now. Besides, I don't care about it that much anymore. I just hope you can live a good life and grow up happily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll be a lawyer when I grow up! I'll clear your name!" the little one said very solemnly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was both happy and sad. 'I'll probably never see the day my son grows up!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, looking at her son's serious eyes now, she replied, "Okay, I'll wait for you to grow up and clear my name."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one smiled and finally started to play with the friends he was familiar with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at her son while he played. She took out her phone and took a photo of her son playing. When she was done, she opened the photo album app and looked at each photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her fingers stopped suddenly. The photo on her phone was not the one she had taken with her son but the one of her, Nelson, and Martin Weiss in the amusement park. She had downloaded it from the amusement park&rsquo;s app last time.</p></div>
