        <h1>Chapter 2085</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If it were in the past, he would have chosen to lock her up and keep her with him forever with no hesitation. However, when you love someone so deeply, you would feel unbearably miserable when they were miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's heart ached. Although it was just a hypothetical situation, she thought it was cruel to make him answer it upon hearing him say this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You won't drive yourself insane, and I won't leave you!" She flung her arms open and embraced him hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason looked down at the person hugging him, and a smile appeared on his lips. He slowly leaned over and rested his head on her shoulder. "You won't leave me, and I won't leave you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace hugged him for quite a long time before calming down. Then, she laughed at herself. "Hey, what's wrong with us? We were just talking about Kyla and Martin Weiss, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She paused. "Is Martin Weiss really going to do that to Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Maybe." It was all Jason could say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, he was not Martin Weiss, and his assumption might not be 100% accurate. Besides, the human heart was fickle. Anything could change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then..." Grace hesitated as if she was wondering what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Do you want me to help you? Do you want to protect Kyla if Martin Weiss is going to force Kyla?" Jason seemed to have read her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah." She nodded. "But this will cause conflicts between the Reed family and the Weiss family, which might impact the Reed family's business."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, Martin Weiss was influential in the market. If the Weiss family did declare war on the Reed family, it was hard to say how much the Reed family's businesses would be affected and how much they would lose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But... Kyla!' Grace pitied Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, everyone had concerns about her ex-convict identity when she was looking for a job back then. Only Kyla was willing to give her a chance and treat her with kindness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was kind to her, and she wanted to protect Kyla as best she could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So what?" Jason smiled casually. "If you want to protect Kyla, then I'll do it for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He spoke so nonchalantly as if it was an easy thing to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But what if Martin Weiss..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No matter what Martin Weiss wants to do, I&rsquo;ll protect the person you want to protect. Grace, I told you I can give you everything you want, even my life. Let alone protecting a person," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's nose felt a little sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This was the man she loved. The man loved her with all he had! How could she not love him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, thank you, and..." She cupped his face and put her lips on his. "I love you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She loved him. It was as if she loved him a little more every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Me too!" He responded to her kiss like he was intoxicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was the only person who could make him so infatuated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was ill at ease all night. She even signed the wrong page when her son needed a parent to sign his homework.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mommy, what's come over you?" Even Nelson saw that something was wrong with his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"N-Nothing, I'm just a little tired today." Kyla hurried to find an excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then you should rest earlier, Mommy!" Nelson said sensibly.</p></div>
