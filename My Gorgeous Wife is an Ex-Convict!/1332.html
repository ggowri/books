        <h1>Chapter 1331</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn tried to break free from him, but his fingers were like steel bars. The more she struggled, the more her hand hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me, didn't you stab your stomach with a glass shard? Yet now you want another child?" Martin Weiss asked sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn stopped struggling and looked up at the man in front of her. No matter how much she used to love him, there was nothing left now that everything had been used up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If he's the guy I like, so what if I'm willing to have a baby with him? Martin Weiss, I'll never have another child with you for as long as I live!" she answered. Her calm voice did not seem to carry any emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face suddenly darkened. "Really? The guy you like? Is it the man earlier? Don't forget how you told me you liked me. You even got naked and climbed into my bed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was only a mistake," she said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Mistake...' The word seemed to agitate him. He instantly lowered his head and kissed her hard on the lips. It was as if he wanted to prove something by silencing her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn made a conscious attempt to resist, but she seemed to give up all resistance and accepted the kiss after a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss kept on deepening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Martin Weiss only kissed her at first because he was triggered by the word &lsquo;mistake&rsquo;, he later lost himself in the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her scent, softness, sweetness... seemed to make him lost himself. It was as if he was brought back to the time when he used to kiss her back then...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss was finally over after a long time. Martin Weiss gasped slightly, his heart beating violently. He had just been mad but was later so engrossed in the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's wrong with me? I can't help kissing this woman and I even... miss it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is this what you call a mistake? You went along with me quite well when I kissed you just now!" he sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just wanted to confirm whether I still have feelings for you, and now it turns out that I don't," said Kyla Corbyn. When he kissed her earlier, her heartbeat remained at the same tempo without even a stir. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss meant nothing to her. It was just a touch of the skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." He glared at her. Her words seemed to provoke him so easily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, I don't have any feelings for you anymore, and you probably have had enough revenge. I lead such a miserable life now. I was imprisoned for three and a half years, and now, my only son will leave me. I don't have much left. That's pretty much all the revenge you can take."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips tightly together and suddenly took the agreement from her hand. "What do you think Nelson will think if he sees the agreement you wrote one day? His mother abandoned him without the slightest hesitation just to marry and have children with another man!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have it your way. Whatever you say to him is up to you. I won&rsquo;t involve myself in it." Kyla Corbyn did not show any changes in her expression. It was as if what he said did not mean anything to her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly felt powerless. It seemed no matter what he did, he could no longer affect her!</p></div>
