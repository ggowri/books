        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy licked her dry lips. "I want to drink some water first."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." He turned to the water dispenser and poured her a glass of warm water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy instinctively raised her hand to take it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick glanced at her bandaged hand, noticing several other cuts and bruises on her hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your hand is not convenient, let me feed you water," he said, offering the cup to her lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was taken aback but didn't refuse, sipping the water slowly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to her injuries, she drank the water slowly, but Mick didn't rush her and patiently fed her until she was done.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally relieved of her thirst, Nancy asked, "How did you end up here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The police contacted me and I came over," Mick replied casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You also arranged for this VIP room, thank you," Nancy said, realizing she wouldn't have been able to stay in such a room otherwise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you tell me what happened in the car accident now?" Mick asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's face turned pale and her lips trembled as she spoke, "I received a call from the Schultz family to retrieve something of their mother's. But...we had an argument and I left without taking anything. Later, as I was leaving, Clarissa drove her car straight at me and I...I passed out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, her body trembled as if she was scared by the terrible memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the light, she looked so fragile and pitiful that Mick couldn't help but hold her gently in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid! No one can hurt you now!" he reassured her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" she asked tearfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really, not just now, but no one can hurt you in the future either," he said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her frightened appearance made him want to immediately crush Clarissa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy seemed tired and cried herself to sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick gently wiped away the tears on her face with his fingers, feeling the heat on his fingertips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Nancy was able to eat and Mick specially prepared liquid food for her. He personally fed her three meals a day and even carried her to the bathroom, only leaving after she looked embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you going to work?" Nancy couldn't help but ask as Mick stayed in her hospital room all day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, do you want me to go to work instead of being here with you?" he asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course not!" she answered instinctively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since that's not the case, then just accept it." he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy felt that Mick's attitude towards her seemed to have changed, becoming more gentle and caring.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And this was exactly what she had hoped for, wasn't it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like this car accident, she saw Clarissa driving towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she had a chance to avoid it. If she ran towards the tree-lined path with more trees on the side, Clarissa's car might not have hit her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... she wanted to take a gamble, so she let the car hit her in the least damaging way possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, she was lucky to have only been injured this badly. If luck wasn't on her side, she could have been critically injured, disabled, or even died!</span></p></div>
