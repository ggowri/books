        <h1>Chapter 4001</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mind gradually became confused, and she could barely hear Irene's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What kind of tool will Irene turn her into?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Will she die?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who can come to her rescue?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy felt her vision darken and her body fell heavily to the ground!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy! Nancy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">An urgent voice sounded in Nancy's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who is it? The voice sounds somewhat familiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who is calling her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy struggled to open her heavy eyelids and saw the dim sky, the bare mountain scenery, and... Jasper's anxious face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper... How did you get here?" Nancy asked instinctively, then suddenly her expression changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because at this moment, she realized that both she and Jasper were tied up with ropes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Jasper's clothes were stained with dirt and he looked disheveled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's Irene. She snuck into the library I often go to and drugged me in the restroom," Jasper said. After that, she doesn't remember anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she woke up, she found herself in front of a cliff by the sea, with Nancy lying next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where's Irene?" Nancy asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's...up ahead, seems to be placing something," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy struggled to sit up, still bound, and saw a car parked not far ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene was occasionally taking things out of the car and arranging them in a certain pattern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What is Irene doing?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy wondered to herself, then whispered to Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper shook his head. "I don't know what she's putting down, but I do recognize this cliff."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You recognize it?" Nancy was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, this is where my mother fell into the sea. My father searched for her here for a long time until he...uh, lost his memory and forgot about her, so he stopped looking," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His mother's fall into the sea was a close call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's why when she realized Irene had brought her and Nancy here, her sense of unease grew even stronger!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can you escape?" Nancy whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper shook his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can the Reed family find this place?" Nancy asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It may take some time," Jasper replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, she had a tracking device on her, both in her phone and in the necklace she wore daily, just in case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when she woke up, she found that all her jewelry and phone were gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was probably taken by Irene!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without the tracking device, judging by the time of day, it had been three hours since she was knocked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Irene deliberately avoided the tracking device, it would probably take some time for the Reed family to find this place!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy bit her lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them were tied up tightly together and couldn't untie the rope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, the rope used to tie them up was obviously a special fire rescue rope, which would be difficult to bite through even if she tried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, biting through it would take a lot of time, and Irene wouldn't give them that time to bite through the rope.</p></div>
