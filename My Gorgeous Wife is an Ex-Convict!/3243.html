        <h1>Chapter 3241</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence stared at the children's watch in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This watch... costs 130,000? He knew that his parents' monthly salary combined was not even 10,000 yuan. His parents often sighed at home about how difficult it was to earn money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, this watch cost more than his family's annual income!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, he felt an obvious "gap" between him and Mr. Barlow, and also between him and Ms. Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Barlow and Miss Three, they belong to the same social class, but he can never get in touch with them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William and his father came to Emerald City this time, but they didn't stay at a hotel in tMason Swansonty at night. Instead, they stayed with the Reed family because the Reed House is big enough and has many guest rooms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper pulled William to her room to play with her. After playing for a while, she suddenly remembered something and pulled out a music score. "Oh, by the way, this is a new music score I just got. I haven't learned this song yet. Do you want to learn it? If you do, I can print out a copy for you later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William took the sheet music and looked through it. After a moment, he turned to Jasper and said seriously, "Jasper, I will have much less time to play the piano in the future, and perhaps I won't have as much time to learn new pieces."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's eyes widened suddenly and he looked at the other person in a daze, "Do you... not like the piano anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He never really had much of a liking for the piano. The only reason he persisted until now was because she liked it. William silently thought to himself and then spoke up, "It's not that I don't like it, it's just that my time needs to be allocated to more important things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's more important?" she wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In addition to studying during the day, I also have to attend some remedial classes. I also need to learn several foreign languages with some teachers, and my dad wants to hire a teacher to teach me some financial knowledge. Therefore, I don't have much time to practice the piano," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked surprised as he listened to the long list of things he was supposed to learn. "You have to learn all of that? But...aren't we just elementary school students? My mom and dad say that as long as we study well in class and enjoy learning what we like, that's enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I can't," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why?" she asked, looking completely puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William bit his lip slightly and returned the sheet music to Jasper's hand. "I need to learn more in order to have the ability to take over my father's company in the future. I also want to become stronger and have more opportunities to obtain what I desire."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was still a bit confused and asked, "William, do you want to become very powerful?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm." He nodded, "Yes, I want to. Very much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because you want something, right? But what exactly is it?" she wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait until I actually get it, then I'll tell you, okay?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, what he really wants is a person, someone who is standing right in front of him now. He wants to be with her every day, see her smile every day, and hope that she will love him back just as much as he loves her.</p></div>
