        <h1>Chapter 1563</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, the people around them showed a look of amusement in their eyes. After all, many people thought that the single mother of the Gregory family was the most likely to marry into the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help frowning when she saw Irene Lynch's Porsche.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had also gotten a lot of information about Irene Lynch from the butler and Terrence. Irene Lynch had only been a minor influencer previously but she led a hard life because she was dumped by a rich second generation and had a child out of wedlock. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Reed family adopted Oriel Lynch in the last two years. The house given by the Reed family was immovable property and could not be touched. Besides, the Reed family gave Irene Lynch 200,000 dollars every month for the mother and daughter's living expenses. Even if they did not spend any of that money, Irene Lynch still could not afford the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Moreover, Irene Lynch's outfit probably cost millions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As Grace sized up Irene Lynch, she was also sizing up Grace. Who would have thought the woman would be Jason's dead wife?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing her stand next to Jason, Irene Lynch was jealous but could only smile and say, "Well... Miss Cummins, hello. I'm sorry for the other day. Please forgive me. I just dote on my daughter too much and said some things I shouldn't have..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before Grace could answer, Jason said solemnly, "She's not Miss Cummins. She's Mrs. Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Everyone around them instantly gasped when he said this. Those who knew that Grace was Jason's wife realized that Jason was announcing Grace's identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though the woman had disappeared for five years, she was still the Reed family's rightful mistress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">People who did not know Grace's identity stared at her dumbfoundedly when they heard that. They had no idea why Emerald City's Young master Reed suddenly appeared with a &lsquo;Young Madam&rsquo;, and it seemed that she also brought a daughter with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, Jasper and Grace looked like mother and daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch felt awkward, feeling as though all the looks on her were of sarcasm and sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, all the parents had tried to curry favor with her previously to become friends with the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I was wrong, Mrs. Reed." Irene Lynch clenched her teeth but still looked apologetic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at Irene Lynch indifferently. "The children were just quarreling. I didn't take it to heart, but I hope you won't use the Reed family&rsquo;s name to do something that&rsquo;ll disgrace the family, Miss Lynch."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch felt even more bitter and looked at Jason with an aggrieved look. "Young master Reed, Young Madam seems to have misunderstood me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said lightly, "Since my wife said so, listen to her." In other words, even if Grace were to punish Irene Lynch, she could only suffer it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was on Grace's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch also got the message. Her face turned pale, and she could only nudge her daughter over. "Come on, Nana. Say hello. Aren't you happy to see Mr. Reed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch greeted Jason as &lsquo;Young master Reed&rsquo; but refused to call Grace her adopted mother. It did not matter to Grace either. After all, she had no attachments to Oriel Lynch.</p></div>
