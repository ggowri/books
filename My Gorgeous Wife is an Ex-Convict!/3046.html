        <h1>Chapter 3044</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Philip returned to the mansion, a sudden thought crossed his mind. He remembered looking at "Grace" through the car window earlier, and it seemed like she had also noticed his car. He saw a hint of panic on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nervous?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What's there to be so flustered about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more he thought about it, the more uneasy Philip felt. He took out his phone and dialed Jason's number directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He hadn't even spoken yet when he heard a woman's voice on the other end of the phone asking, "Jason, who's calling?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Is that...Grace?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the voice is a bit distant and unclear through the phone, the only person who would shout "Jason, Jason" is Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Grace is currently with Jason, then what was the deal with the "Grace" who was alone earlier?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Philip thought about it, he suddenly asked urgently, "Jason, was Grace with you the whole time and didn't go back to the Barlow family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was taken aback, then said, "Yes, she's been with me all along. What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just now, a 'Grace' came to the Barlow family, but she quickly left with a big package. When she left, I happened to be returning to the Barlow family in my car and only caught a glimpse of her from the side. She looked a lot like Grace," Philip said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment of silence, Jason suddenly asked, "Where is Jasmine now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jasmine should still be..." Philip's words trailed off as he suddenly realized something. Then, as if he had just reacted, he ran towards the room where Jasmine was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He quickly opened the door, but the room was empty. The baby crib that should have had a baby in it was empty too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip took a deep breath and on the other end of the phone, Jason seemed to sense something and asked, "What's going on? Did Jasmine disappear?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'm sending people to find her and track down the car from earlier!" Philip said. He couldn't believe someone had the audacity to come to the Barlow family and take their child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll be right back!" Jason said quickly. "Besides sending people to track the car, gather all the servants who have seen that woman in the house and see if they know anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I understand," Philip said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the call ended, Philip immediately ordered his subordinates to act, and the entire Barlow family was suddenly on high alert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side, after finishing the call, Jason instructed the boatman to dock the boat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was standing nearby and although she didn't hear what Philip was saying, she had a feeling that something might have happened to their youngest daughter, Jasmine. She quickly turned to Jason and asked, "Jason, what happened to Jasmine? Is everything okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason repeated what Philip had said on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned when she heard it, her face filled with anxiety and unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could this happen? She was still with the Barlow family, but somehow she was taken away by a woman who looks very similar to her?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even the servants of the Barlow family mistook it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda heard about the woman who looked a lot like Grace, she suddenly pictured a woman in her mind - Whitney!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney looks very similar to Grace, and she intentionally styles her makeup and hair to imitate Grace. At first glance, it's easy to mistake them for each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could it be that the person who took Jasmine from the Barlow family is Whitney?!</p></div>
