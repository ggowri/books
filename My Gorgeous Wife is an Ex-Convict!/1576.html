        <h1>Chapter 1574</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"This isn't a place for the likes of you," Irene Lynch said arrogantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said as if amused, "What's the matter? Are you superior to me? What you have now is just because your daughter became the adopted daughter of the Reed family. Before that, did you come from a better family, have a better education, better career, or better income than me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Honestly speaking, Irene Lynch was just an ordinary citizen before this. She was not any better than Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch's face looked extremely grim. She picked up the glass of water the sales assistant had poured for her and wanted to splash it on Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was on her guard. As soon as she saw what Irene Lynch was doing, she raised her hand and twisted Irene Lynch's hand. Immediately, the glass of water in Irene Lynch&rsquo;s hand spilled all over herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch let out a shrill, drawing the attention of the boutique staff and other customers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The manager hurried over. When they saw what had happened, they quickly helped Irene Lynch wipe the water off her and asked what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch pointed her finger at Lina. "She splashed water on me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said lightly, "Why didn't you say you were going to splash water on me but ended up getting splashed instead?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The manager looked at the two of them and sized them up before saying, &ldquo;Miss, please apologize to Miss Lynch. No matter what, it's true that you splashed water on Miss Lynch."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked at the manager. "Which also means you only look at the result regardless of the cause?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The manager said coldly, "You harmed Miss Lynch. Does it matter why it happened? If you refuse to apologize, then we have to ask you to leave. Besides, Miss Lynch can hold you accountable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The person who welcomed Irene Lynch earlier came over. She was about to tell her that the gown was being tried on now and she might have to wait for a while. She was surprised to see that Irene Lynch&rsquo;s head was wet and her chest was stained with water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">While listening to the manager and Lina's conversation, the sales assistant looked at Lina even more unkindly. "Do you know who Miss Lynch is? You'll regret it if you don't apologize. Also, you'd better get your friend to take that gown off. It's a waste letting her try on that fancy gown!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said, "You mean Irene Lynch? Of course, I know who she is. She's the mother of the Reed family's adopted daughter! You're just a sales assistant in a boutique. You don't seem to be in a position to ask me to apologize to anyone, don&rsquo;t you think? You&rsquo;re only the staff who serve the customers, not judges who can decide whether the customers should apologize."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The manager and the sales assistant looked grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was shocked when the sales assistant mentioned &lsquo;friend&rsquo;. 'Is that friend... Grace? Is Grace in the boutique now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was thinking about it when she heard a voice. "Who's apologizing to who?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch shuddered and looked in the direction of the voice. She could only see Grace walking over in the black gown she had her eye on earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had her long hair up. A few strands of hair casually fell on her cheeks. The gown made Grace look elegant and posh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch felt even more jealous when she saw Grace. It... was the gown she had her eye on! She had been hoping to impress everyone at the banquet with this gown so that she could defeat Grace.</p></div>
