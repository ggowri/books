        <h1>Chapter 1815</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had no idea what was on his mind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sometimes, he seemed to care about her and want to get back together with her. However, he clearly resisted her just now. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not even allow her to touch him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'In that case, why did he accompany me to the pregnancy check-up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Or... does he only care about the baby? If I lost the baby, maybe he wouldn&rsquo;t be so nice to me anymore.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina smiled wryly. When did she become so sentimental? She was even undecided whether to keep the baby in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the car stopped, she suddenly realized that she was already in her neighborhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina turned to look at Hadwin Stephenson but found that he had fallen asleep while leaning on the back of the chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was obvious fatigue on his face as he slept. There was a faint shade of bluish-black under his eyes, obviously from a lack of sleep. A few strands of hair fell over his forehead, and his long black lashes made his handsome face look angelic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was as good-looking as ever. Perhaps he was even better-looking now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She would still fall into a daze whenever she stared at him, even after five years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As if feeling her gaze, his eyelashes quivered slightly and he slowly opened his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His dark eyes instantly caught sight of her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina..." he murmured her name. His voice was hoarse and affectionate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her heart could not help trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He slowly raised his hand as if to touch her cheek. However, just as he was about to touch her, the dazed look in his eyes disappeared. He withdrew his hand and asked indifferently, "Have we arrived at your home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, we have," she said, feeling a sense of loss that she could not even describe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Why am I feeling this way? Did I wish that he had touched my face?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Gosh. Lina, what are you thinking?' She scolded herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She quickly turned around, opened the car door, and got out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson also opened the car door and got out. He stopped in front of her. "Lina, give me a week, okay? I only need seven days. I'll come look for you again in seven days. I have something important to tell you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is it about the car's repair fees?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was stunned and did not seem to get it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She said, "Didn't you accompany me to the pregnancy check-up to discuss lowering the repair fees for hitting your car last time? Are you going to discuss it next time since we didn't discuss it today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He showed a sudden bitter smile. "Do you think the important thing between you and me is just the repair fees?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His bitter smile made her feel as if her heart had been pricked with a needle. It was so uncomfortable and even hurt a little. "Then what is it that&rsquo;s so important that you can't tell me now but must do it a week later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because the blood curse would be gone in a week! If only he could make it through the final session, then he would be able to hold her and kiss her without any pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If he did not make it a week later... He had already hired a lawyer, made a will, appointed someone to run Stephenson Group, set up a foundation, and determined that the company&rsquo;s annual earnings would be transferred to her so that she could live her best life!</p></div>
