        <h1>Chapter 730</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, a cake will be enough. However, this year, my birthday comes the day after the 49th day of Grandma's death. I don't want a big celebration. I just want to have a cake with you, Lina, and the rest," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was her first birthday after they got together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grandma had just passed away, after all. She was still mourning for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want a boisterous birthday celebration. She just wanted to celebrate her birthday quietly with him and her friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure. I'll prepare your birthday cake," he answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you." She smiled and looked at the time. It was almost time for him to work in the afternoon. "Then, I'll get going and leave you to work."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she picked up her bag and stood up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she had taken two steps, a pair of arms encircled her from behind her, and she was immediately swept into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face was buried in her neck, taking in her body scent. "Don't... Go to the hospital tomorrow. I'll take you to another hospital and get another doctor to check out your headaches, all right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hoarse voice spoke softly as his arms held her tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shivered a little, and it was some time before she replied, "Just wait&hellip; Until I come back from the hospital tomorrow. If my head still hurts, you can get me a doctor to check it out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was silent. He just held her so tightly and did not speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay?" she spoke and broke the silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then we'll do as you say," he said, letting go a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head around and looked at Jason. His deep, beautiful eyes seemed to fill with loneliness again, but the next moment, he looked just like usual. His eyes were gentle, and there was a faint smile on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found it strange, but she could not point it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... I'm going home." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He spoke again, "I'll have someone escort you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only after Grace had left the president's office that Jason went back to the coffee table and picked up the unfinished apple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The apple had been nibbled a few times before, and the skin was a bit uneven, but she had peeled it for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, it would&rsquo;ve been so great if you had said yes," muttered Jason as he ate the apple in his hand one mouthful at a time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;The apple is still sweet, but why is my mouth full of bitterness?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took Nelson out of the listening class with a slight smile on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was getting better and better. When he communicated with others, if they did not pay attention to the hearing aid he wore in his ear, they would hardly notice the difference between him and a normal child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The teacher there also said that he could come to class less often now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could go once a week.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as her son could live like a normal child, Kyla was satisfied, and all the pains she had suffered would be worth it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the little one stopped in his tracks. Kyla was stunned as her son had stopped at the entrance of a huge shopping mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had to take a bus back to the small restaurant, which was 50 meters away from the shopping mall. The little one stopped before they got to the bus stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why&rsquo;d you stop?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson said, "It's Aunty's birthday. I want to buy a present for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;ve already bought it," said Kyla. When Grace came to interview for the job, she wrote her birthday on the profile, so she had noted it down.</p></div>
