        <h1>Chapter 546</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed the recommendations online and ordered their set meals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When their food came, not only the children's meals were made into all kinds of cute cartoon characters, but also the adults' meals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Grace looked at Jason who was next to her. He was dressed in a suit and tie with his hair brushed back today. He looked like a typical social elite who was ready to go to all kinds of parties and meetings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now in front of him was a set meal of cartoon characters. It was a bizarre contrast that Grace could not help laughing at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's so funny?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing, just... Uh, I've never seen you eat a cartoon meal before, and by the way, the pink pig on the cartoon meal you're eating is Peppa Pig." Grace helped to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason chuckled, but speaking of which, he had really never eaten anything like this before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he was a child, he had seen similar cartoon meals when he passed by some restaurants with his parents. He wanted to eat there, but his family was very poor, so he could not eat such meals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, the price of such a meal was too heavy for their family to bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he could well afford it now, he had never thought of eating it. If he had not come with her today, he might not have been reminded of this memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace helped the little one with his food and tied up his bib. He usually ate by himself, so she let Nelson eat by himself with a small spoon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson held the small spoon with his small hand, spooning the food into his mouth and eating it one scoop after another. However, he was still young, after all. It was easy to spill food. Soon, the bib and the table were covered with uneaten food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was careful in keeping food off the little one's clothes and occasionally wiped the corners of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Nelson was done eating, he kept his beautiful eyes fixed on the play area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled, took the bib off his neck, and said to Jason, "I'll go play with Nelson for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," he said as he nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took Nelson to the play area and started playing on the slide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one happily stomped his little legs up the steps to the top of the slide, then slid down while Grace caught the little one firmly at the bottom so that he could slide down without injuring himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little surprised when she caught Nelson with a chuckle and a smile on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson used to laugh more silently. Now, even though the cochlear implant had not been reinstalled, his laugh could be heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at Grace in the distance with a gentle doting gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he did not like her to focus so much on another person, even if that person was a child... Looking at her gentle motherly expression right now made him want to look at her again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her smile and actions made her seem like a good mother. If someone did not know better, they would think she was the mother of the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if it was a blessing to be her child as she could use her motherly love to nurture her children&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How he had wished for his mother to treat him so gently. He used to wish his mother could look at him more, talk to him more, even&hellip; Give him a few more hugs from time to time!</p></div>
