        <h1>Chapter 3136</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Tracy in front of her was just a stranger, someone Valda didn't know, so she didn't want to talk too much with these people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't think I need to explain myself to you," she said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're feeling guilty, aren't you? If there's nothing to hide, why can't you talk about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absolutely!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two companions were mocking Valda with sarcasm and insults.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy turned to Valda and said, "There's nothing that can't be talked about with others. I think it's not just our curiosity, but also many people will be curious when Brian introduces you to the media in the future. Although Brian is not in the entertainment industry, the news media and the public are very interested in him. Since you are Brian's fianc&eacute;e, it's better to clarify the situation when he went missing earlier, so as to avoid being criticized by some haters!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is not your concern, Miss Barlow," Valda said, too lazy to argue with the three people. She turned around and walked away, intending to find Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Valda lifted her foot to take a step, one of Tracy's female companions behind her intentionally stuck out her foot and tripped Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda fell to the ground in a clumsy manner with a loud "bang".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The woman had a smug smile on her lips and spoke in a affected tone, "Oh my, how did you fall? Couldn't you stand firm? Shall I give you a hand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt a dull pain where she had fallen, and as a result, several people around her turned to look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was about to stand up when suddenly Tracy's voice sounded, "Hey, why are the soles of your shoes so strange?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, everyone's attention was drawn to Valda's shoes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to the fall, her shoes are now exposed in front of everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately, Tracy's companion behind her burst into laughter, "Her shoes, one sole is thick and the other is thin, could it be that there's something wrong with her legs?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it a limp in the leg?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh my god, I hope Brian isn't in the dark about this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This woman is so scheming, I hope she didn't deceive Brian too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As these women set the tone, people around them began to discuss it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face turned pale. She didn't mind others knowing about her leg problem, but being mocked in such a way in front of everyone was something she hadn't expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She instinctively tucked her feet under her skirt and tried to stand up, but Tracy and her friends deliberately blocked her and wouldn't let her get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy even said, "If you have a problem with your legs, you should let others know. How can you deceive people with those shoes? Are you being hypocritical? Does Brian know about this?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda knew that Tracy and her friends wanted more people to know about her leg problem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me get up!" Valda struggled to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You shouldn't deceive Brian like this. You should let Brian see your shoes too!" Tracy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, her two companions kept obstructing Valda from standing up. One of them accidentally stepped on Valda's hand with her fancy shoes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" Valda cried out in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person pretended to be surprised and said, "Oh dear, what happened? Sorry, I stepped on you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda bit her lip, not wanting to embarrass herself further in front of these people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her embarrassment would only please these people.</p></div>
