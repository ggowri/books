        <h1>Chapter 1855</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Madam, you can ask Young master Reed if you want to know," Terrence replied politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What about Jason? Where is he now?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence replied, "I'm not sure about that. When Young master Reed left the cemetery, he only told us what to do with Old Lawyer Watts and his wife. He left without saying anything else. I'm only his subordinate. I can't ask my boss about his whereabouts."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Terrence left with Old Lawyer Watts and his wife. Grace stared blankly at the retreating car, only thinking that what had happened in the past hour was like a dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was happily accompanying her mentor and his wife during their visit to Emerald City, but&hellip; It turned out that Mrs. Watts was Jay's missing mother, and Jay hated her more than she thought!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Jay... Where is Jay now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace quickly took out her phone and dialed Jason's phone number, but no one answered no matter how many times she dialed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Answer the phone! Hurry and answer the phone! I have so much to say to you!' Grace shouted in her head. Jason, who was sitting in a car, looked down at his phone with the name &lsquo;Grace&rsquo; constantly flashing on the screen. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The person he loved the most might not love him the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she did regard him as someone who mattered the most to her, she would not have chosen to kneel. Did she know that the whole world seemed to fall apart when she knelt?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She asked him to spare the person he hated the most! That woman had brought him so much pain. If his wound back then were a little more serious, he would have died. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew what his mother had done to her. She knew about his pain and hatred but still did it anyway!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It turned out it was so painful when your feelings were not reciprocated despite loving that person so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though she said she loved him, she still did not choose him when she had to make a choice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason closed his eyes and turned off his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not want to hear her voice as he was scared that she would plead for that woman again. He was also scared that what she wanted to say would only prove that she did not love him as much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The images that flashed through his mind were... images from five years ago. They were the memories he had lost.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, these memories seemed to remind him of the truth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She would not have married him if she had not been pregnant and if it were not for Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car pulled up at the prison gate, and the driver respectfully said, "Young master Reed, we've arrived."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason slowly opened his eyes. The pain in his dark eyes earlier was hidden now, and his gaze was just chilly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason opened the car door and got out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason met Secretary Wang in the prison&rsquo;s visitor room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Clothed in the prisoners&rsquo; uniform, Secretary Wang looked at Jason with a smile on his face as if he were looking at an old friend.</p></div>
