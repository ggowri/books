        <h1>Chapter 4000</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:left;">When Nancy arrived at Irene&#x27;s rental room, she looked at her and said, &quot;Okay, it&#x27;s time for you to state your conditions.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Let&#x27;s have a cup of tea first, sit down and talk slowly,&quot; Irene said, brewing tea and placing it in front of Nancy.</p><p style="text-align:left;">However, Nancy did not drink the tea, she was still waiting for Irene to continue.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Irene smiled, &quot;Both you and I have been abandoned by the Reed family, so I want to join forces with you. How about we team up to deal with the Reed family?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Nancy frowned and directly refused, &quot;I have no intention of going against the Reed family.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Are you afraid that the Reed family will retaliate? As long as we do it secretly, the Reed family won&#x27;t...&quot; Irene&#x27;s words were interrupted by Nancy, &quot;The Reed family doesn&#x27;t owe me anything. I separated from Mick, but it was my fault. I have no reason to blame them.&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;But you resigned because of Mick, right? And you plan to leave Emerald City. If it weren&#x27;t for Mick, would you need to leave the city where you were born?&quot; Irene said, &quot;Join forces with me, and our pain should be tasted by the Reed family!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Nancy stood up abruptly and scolded, &quot;Enough, I won&#x27;t team up with you! Besides, in my opinion, the Reed family has never mistreated you! You keep saying that the Reed family pushed you into the abyss, but you should know that those riches and glory were never yours to begin with. The Reed family can give them to you, and they can also take them back! If you really want wealth and glory, then rely on yourself to obtain them!&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Aren&#x27;t you afraid that I will upload those recordings of yours to the internet? Aren&#x27;t you afraid that Clarissa will be released from prison and all your previous efforts will be in vain?&quot; Irene threatened.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Nancy took a deep breath, &quot;Even if my efforts are in vain, it doesn&#x27;t matter. In the future, I will find new evidence to put Clarissa back in prison. But if you really upload the recordings, do you think you can do it without leaving any traces? If the world knows that I used Mick, I will become a clown, but the Reed family will also lose face. Is it really something you can do to go against the Reed family?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;You...&quot; Irene looked at Nancy fiercely.</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;I advise you to give up on the idea of retaliating against the Reed family...&quot; Nancy hadn&#x27;t finished speaking when suddenly her body staggered, a feeling of weakness sweeping over her whole body.</p><p style="text-align:left;">She propped herself up on the edge of the table with one hand, barely managing to steady herself.</p><p style="text-align:left;">What&#x27;s going on? Why is her whole body feeling weak, and why can&#x27;t she control the urge to fall asleep?</p><p style="text-align:left;">She was so careful all the way here, and she didn&#x27;t even drink the tea that Irene made!</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Nancy, you&#x27;re careful, but I&#x27;m even more cautious.&quot; Irene&#x27;s voice echoed in the room. &quot;I didn&#x27;t add anything to the tea, but haven&#x27;t you noticed that all the windows in this house are closed, and even the curtains are drawn, making it completely airtight?&quot;</p><p style="text-align:left;">Nancy was shocked, could it be...</p><p style="text-align:left;">&quot;Haven&#x27;t you noticed the faint fragrance in the room? I lit some incense that can make people unconscious. Since you didn&#x27;t plan to join forces with me, I can only make you my tool of revenge!&quot; Irene said, her mouth emitting a series of triumphant laughter.</p><p style="text-align:left;">As if her plan had already succeeded.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Don&#x27;t fall asleep! Whatever happens, don&#x27;t fall asleep!</p><p style="text-align:left;">Nancy desperately shouted in her mind, trying to take out the self-defence weapon she had prepared from her bag. If she could knock down Irene, then she would be able to...</p></div>
