        <h1>Chapter 4360 Introducing the Job</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it worth it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley wasn't sure, after all, she had only known Calvert for a short time and had only met him a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But every time, Calvert left quite an impression on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was shy and didn't easily accept the kindness of others. Despite having such a beautiful face, there wasn't a hint of arrogance. Instead, he seemed to carry a sense of inferiority.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Calvert was stuck in such a terrible environment, with a father like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she wanted to help him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, helping Calvert was just a simple task for Harley!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, can I use the company's resources?" Harley turned to look at Brian.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian chuckled, "Why not? But the person you want to help, do they want to join this circle?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's got a decent </span><span>look,</span><span> I think he could start off as a print model doing some photo shoots. I want to help him improve his living conditions. As for whether he wants to take this job, or stay in this industry, that's up to him to decide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All Harley gave was just a chance!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Brian looked at his daughter with satisfaction. Indeed, she had grown up and understood the principle that it's better to teach a man to fish than to give him a fish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Harley saw Calvert again, the injury on Calvert's face seemed to have almost healed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to go see your father?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Earlier, Harley had his father taken to the hospital for a comprehensive check-up. He learned about the results of the examination from the doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's father wasn't in good health. Years of heavy drinking had led to nerve degeneration, and he also suffered from a volatile temper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Harley simply let Calvert's father receive the necessary treatment in the hospital.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need," Calvert said, a hint of disgust flashing in his eyes as </span><span>he</span><span> spoke of his father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, Calvert's father wasn't at home, giving him a rare peace. He didn't have to fear being woken up in the middle of the night to his father's sudden appearance, beating him with fists and kicks. Nor did he have to worry about the little money he had painstakingly saved up being taken away by his father!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I'm afraid I can only pay you back for my father's medical bills once I start working in the future," Calvert murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even then, Calvert, despite having a full scholarship and working diligently, could only just make enough to support himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't worry about the money," Harley said. "I'm the one who wanted your father to be hospitalized for examination and treatment. Naturally, you don't have to pay for it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you're not obligated to pay this money!" Calvert insisted, "I will definitely pay it back!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you insist on paying me back, that's fine. Whenever you have the money in the future, you can repay me then," Harley said with a smile. He handed Calvert a business card. "This is the head of a modeling agency. They're looking for part-time models. If you're interested, you could give it a try."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert took the business card, staring blankly at the company name, address, and contact number on it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A model?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your looks are pretty </span><span>good,</span><span> you could give it a shot. This is a decent part-time gig. If you really manage to pass the audition, you could do some photoshoots afterward. The pay is </span><span>pretty good too," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert pursed his thin lips, could he really be a model?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And also, he had accepted Harley's help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this help, in Harley's view, a form of charity? Did Harley think he was so pitiful that he was giving him a job out of pity?</span></p></div>
