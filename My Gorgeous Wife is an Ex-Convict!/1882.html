        <h1>Chapter 1880</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This was his best compromise!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace bit her lip. "What if... I won't go home with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes darkened, and his voice grew colder. "Have you thought this through?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, we can't delay Mrs. Watts&rsquo;s treatment any longer. I have to send her back to L City, or she&rsquo;ll die! I can't watch her die and do nothing!" she said bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So you're going to hurt me anyway, aren't you?" he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm sorry. I'm sorry..." It was all she could say. Then, as if she was too scared to meet his eyes, she turned around, sped back into the car, and started it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wanted to send Mrs. Watts back. She could not let Mrs. Watts die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, can we leave?" Old Lawyer Watts asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll try," said Grace. She was not sure herself. Besides Jay standing there, there were also barricades set up at the front. Could she really break through them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason just stood there, staring coldly at Grace through the windshield.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Grace started the car, he just stood there without moving!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Get out of the way. Jay, get out of the way!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace kept screaming in her head. If she could send Mrs. Watts back to L City, she would do everything she could to get him to forgive her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just this one time! She just needed this one time! She would never do anything to betray him again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As the car got closer to him, Grace tensed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Several of Jason's men tried to stand in front of the car, but Jason snapped coldly, "No one is allowed to come close!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The men instantly froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason seemed to be waiting for Grace's car as if to see how close she could get to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, get out of the way, okay? Please, get out of the way..." Grace kept on praying, but her car eventually stopped just a meter away from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she went any farther, she would have hit him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is there really no way I can leave with Mrs. Watts?' Grace stared at the man out of the window who was still standing there, looking at her from afar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her face was already in tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What should I do to make him get out of the way and let me send Mrs. Watts back to L City?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts seemed disheartened too. "Grace, I don't think... we can go back to L City!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Grace did not seem to hear him. She just looked straight at Jason, who was standing in front of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Tears almost blinded her eyes as her hands clutched the steering wheel. They seemed to be the only ones left in the whole world!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes were so cold. They were piercing her heart like frozen swords.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wished to never hurt him if she could and that she would never break her promise. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is there really... no way we can leave today?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just when she thought that she could not leave, she suddenly saw him walk to the side.</p></div>
