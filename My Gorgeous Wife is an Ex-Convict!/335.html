        <h1>Chapter 334</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At office dinners, she was the only person who would go out of her way to remind colleagues who had been drinking not to drive back but to find a replacement driver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could a person like her drink and drive?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must have been wronged, he thought. However, as a lawyer, he did not even dare to help her clear her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid that her case would be too complicated, and he was afraid that he would have to go against Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who in Emerald City dared to mess with Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could only say that Grace had... bad luck!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By noon, Jason's secretary placed a large order. Grace was in charge of delivering it, and this routine continued for days on end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then... Jason would make her stay for lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had explicitly hinted to Jason several times about this, hoping he would not do it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he raised his eyebrows and asked with a bright smile, "Don't you like to have lunch with me? I just want you to eat with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was rendered speechless. It was like committing a foul to see his smile with the longing in his amorous eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found it easier and easier to get into a trance while facing Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she raised the subject to Lina, Lina naturally analyzed and texted back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Of course, it's because of his beauty!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Beauty?&rsquo; Grace frowned and replied to Lina on the chat page. &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Jason looks like a million dollars. How many male celebrities in the entertainment industry can look like him? It's only fair that you'll get into a trance when looking at that face every day.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That sounded about right to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;What the hell is going on with you and Jason right now, Grace? I keep thinking that he might be serious about you,&rsquo; texted Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;If he's just playing some siblings games with you, I don't think he would have bothered to come and save me because of you, let alone go against Hadwin.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silently staring at the message from her friend on the phone like there was something wrong with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Grace? Are you still there?&rsquo; Lina sent a message to ask when her best friend did not reply for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;I'm here,&rsquo; Grace replied with two words and changed the subject by saying, &lsquo;By the way, what is up with you and Hadwin?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Well, it's a long story,&rsquo; Lina replied. &lsquo;I'll tell you about it the next time we meet. You said you've got a delivery job. When&rsquo;s your day off now?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Every Saturday after two o&rsquo;clock. The boss will give me half a day off,&rsquo; said Grace. After all, delivery jobs tend to leave relatively little time for rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;All right, let's meet up on Saturday then,&rsquo; said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Time to deliver the order, Grace." Kyla Corbyn's voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly bid Lina goodbye, then put away her phone. She looked at the huge pile of packed food Kyla Corbyn had prepared, which, needless to say, was for Reed Group.</p></div>
