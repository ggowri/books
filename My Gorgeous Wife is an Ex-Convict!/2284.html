        <h1>Chapter 2282</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She used to hate him so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that the hatred would eventually be healed over time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can we... still be together?" she murmured to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only silence answered her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sighed and was about to leave when a voice suddenly escaped from his mouth, "Kyla... Don't leave me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was surprised. Then, she found out that Martin Weiss was still asleep. Words just slipped out of his mouth while he was asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't leave... Does he know how hard it is for me to make up my mind to say yes to those two words?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was discharged the next day. Grace and Lina came to pick her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While helping Kyla pack up, Martin Weiss also stood by Kyla's side, even intending to help her get into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace ultimately said, "Chairman Weiss, we won't lose Kyla. We'll make sure that we send her to the store safely. Don't worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I'm going home. Rest well in the hospital. I'll come and visit you," Kyla said to Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," he replied obediently like a good student.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Kyla was following Grace and Lina into the elevator, Martin Weiss suddenly hugged her and said in a voice only the two of them could hear, "I'll wait for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze, and he quickly loosened his arms. "Alright, get in the elevator."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lip slightly and entered the elevator with her ears burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he just said was like a promise. A... promise that he would be waiting for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But is he waiting for me to visit him in the hospital? Or is he waiting for me to make up my mind? Is he waiting for me to tell him if I want to be with him...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the elevator doors closed slowly, Lina quipped, "Kyla, you're blushing. Things between you and Martin Weiss seem a little different from before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said somewhat sheepishly, "Alright, stop making fun of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss saved Kyla this time. She must be grateful," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just grateful? Come to think of it. Martin Weiss seems okay. No matter what, he still risked his life to save Kyla," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three people chatted as they exited the elevator and walked toward Grace's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting into the car, Grace asked, "Kyla, what are you going to do about Martin Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As her best friend, she could see how differently Kyla treated Martin Weiss now. After all, if Martin Weiss had suddenly hugged Kyla back then, Kyla would have pushed him away immediately instead of blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated slightly and said, "He... wants to start over with me and become a real married couple. He wants me to think about it." She did not keep it a secret from her two best friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina immediately looked curious. "Kyla, are you going to say yes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "I don't know. After all these years, I don't know if I should be with him anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the first time in years, she was hesitating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Kyla, you should ask yourself whether you still love Martin Weiss. I think being with someone is never about whether we should or not but whether we love them."</p></div>
