        <h1>Chapter 1307</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean spoke even more bluntly, "Grace, did you hear that? The only one I have in my heart is Lily. Since you despise me, why would you come here to approach me with such an excuse? How shameless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're the one with no shame. I never said I was here to see you! Sean, who do you think you are? How great do you think you are that I can't get over you? You know what? I think the worst thing in my life is having met a scumbag like you!" Grace snapped back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean instantly lost his cool before so many people. He immediately rushed forward, raising his hand to hit Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bodyguard who followed Grace kicked the man she had subdued earlier out of the way before moving to pin Sean to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Madam, how do you want to deal with this?" the bodyguard asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let him stay on the ground. I'll call the police, and if any of them dare come forward, just hit them," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," the bodyguard answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd in the private room was stunned. For a moment, no one dared to take a step forward. After all, they had witnessed how skilled the bodyguard next to Grace was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Decisive and agile, she was a professional!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean, who was pinned to the ground by the bodyguard, kept screaming and struggling but was unable to free himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily said with a stern face, "Grace, I don't care who's having your back, but you'd better ask this person to let go of Sean right now. Otherwise, you're going against the Atkinson family and the Stevens family! You'll be put in a difficult situation in Emerald City!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Grace could speak, another voice rang. "I'd like to see what difficult situation she would be in!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A figure walked to Grace's side. Grace turned her head and saw that it was Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The people in the private room were immediately surprised. The few people who did not know Jason were all right, but those who knew him were all dumbfounded, with Sean and Lily being the ones suffering the greatest shock!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean's voice was immediately stuck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily's face turned red and pale, and she could only say awkwardly, "It's... It's probably a misunderstanding..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A misunderstanding?" Jason looked at Grace and asked, "What's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I entered the wrong private room, but..." As if amused, Grace glanced at Sean who was on the floor. "It seems that Mr. Sean and Miss Lily over there thought I was trying to approach Mr. Sean on purpose."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly. "What? Is Sean better than me that you'd leave your husband behind and approach him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean and Lily were dumbfounded when the word &lsquo;husband&rsquo; was uttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily asked with a look of shock, "You're... married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked coldly at Lily. "From now on, disrespecting her in Emerald City is tantamount to disrespecting me. You should know what the consequences will be."</p></div>
