        <h1>Chapter 1269</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers were holding her jaw tightly, not allowing her to evade him, and his lips were a little cool, which was so different from hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His kiss was also domineering. It was absolutely overbearing, but with a gentleness and longing from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only feel her heart beating faster and faster. At this moment, she somehow did not want to struggle or resist it anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She slowly closed her eyes and went along with his kiss. What happened in the past suddenly recurred to her. It turned out some feelings were unforgettable even though it had already been a year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She told herself to forget about it, but she had not forgotten anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss was finally over, Grace opened her eyes and stared at the person in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you resist me?" his voice muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know how to answer him because even she did not have the answer to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because you want to be my family, so even if I kiss you or do more intimate things to you, you can put up with it for the sake of the children?" He frowned slightly, and there seemed to be a touch of displeasure in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only married her for the children, but he did not want her to do it all just because of the children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers caressed her neck as he spoke, and they slowly went down...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She came back to her senses and seized his hand, saying, "You said you wouldn't touch me without my consent!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled faintly. "I said I wouldn't touch you, but... it's only during your pregnancy. Do you wish that I won&rsquo;t touch you for the rest of your life? Or do you plan for us to be a couple who treat each other as guests forever?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers slipped under her clothes, and her body shuddered. Suddenly, that familiar queasy feeling returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost unconsciously, she pushed him away. She ran into the bathroom and threw up by the sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Blaargh... Blaargh..." The sound of vomiting kept coming from the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stood where he was, staring blankly at the palm of his right hand with her body temperature still on his fingertips...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a faint hint of self-mockery at the corners of his raised lips, he walked to the bathroom door step by step. He stood quietly as he watched her throw up heavily while bent over the sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After some time, Grace was almost done throwing up. She took a breath and gargled. When she looked up, she found Jason standing by the bathroom door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It happened all of a sudden&mdash;" She had barely begun speaking when he cut her short.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Was it because of my touch?" he murmured, walking up to her and looking at her pale face. Those almond-shaped eyes seemed to have grown darker. Her small nose and those pitiful lips... Only by kissing them could one understand how wonderful they felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One would become addicted and obsessed with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, why did he seem to be the only one addicted to it? Why was he still so easily influenced by her and could even go out of control?</p></div>
