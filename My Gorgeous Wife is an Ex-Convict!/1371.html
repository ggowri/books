        <h1>Chapter 1370</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn got home and put Nelson carefully on the bed. A notification beeped on her phone and she glanced casually at it. It was a news pop-up notification.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She usually would not pay attention to such news, but this one made her shudder suddenly. She quickly picked up the phone and opened the link to the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was news about Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The news said that Hadwin Stephenson had joined forces with the Jackson family of J City and suddenly appeared at the shareholders' meeting today. He also retrieved his rights to the Stephenson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police had also arrested the Stephenson family's first wife and her two sons. The arrest was on suspicion of wounding with intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It could be said that the first wife&rsquo;s family had lost everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson became the final winner in this war!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the news report also said something about the Stephenson family and the Jackson family intending to merge through marriage and that their companies might also merge in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was shocked. 'The Stephenson family and the Jackson family are merging through marriage... Does that mean Hadwin Stephenson is going to marry someone from the Jackson family? After all, if the two sons of the Stephenson family's first wife are in prison, then Hadwin Stephenson is the only person who can marry.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if that was the case, what about Lina?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn could not help but feel anxious and worried at the thought of Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was nothing she could do about it, so she could only call Grace's number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I just saw the news and it said Hadwin Stephenson has shown up. The Stephenson family is... even going to merge with the Jackson family through marriage. Is this true?" Kyla Corbyn asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace replied, "It's true. At least what they&rsquo;ve reported seems to be true. But I still have to ask Hadwin Stephenson in person what's going on! Keep this from Lina. I've also told her parents not to tell her until we find out what's going on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it!" replied Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, Grace looked at Jason and said, "I want to meet Hadwin Stephenson in person and ask him what on earth is going on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you're not in the right shape to travel long distances. Neither transportation modes, plane or train, are convenient for you,&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... that's Hadwin Stephenson. Lina has been thinking about him from the moment she woke up!&rdquo; Grace panicked. She had found out about the news earlier than Kyla Corbyn, and she also knew how true the news was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least, the Jackson family and the Stephenson family did have plans to merge their businesses together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Usually, the surest way for a business merger was through marriage!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Hadwin Stephenson was indeed intimate with the Jackson family's &lsquo;real&rsquo; heiress. The Jackson family's heiress had held Hadwin Stephenson's arm and accompanied him into Stephenson Group's shareholders meeting!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at Grace's anxious expression and could not help sighing. "Lina is always so important to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wouldn't be where I am if it wasn't for her!" said Grace.</p></div>
