        <h1>Chapter 997</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Andrea Schwartz, we're all colleagues. Don't you always say that you and Grace are old colleagues and you two get along well? How could you do such a thing behind her back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, some people just like to act one way to our faces and another behind our backs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their colleagues spoke up. Andrea Schwartz only wished to dig a hole in the ground and bury herself in it! Now, instead of Grace getting kicked out of the firm, she was the one who could not stay any longer! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz's incident seemed like a joke. Since it was trending online, Andrea Schwartz took the day off and went home while Grace worked on her files.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Baldwin's trial would begin in a few days. Although Elise Dean refused to admit that she was the perpetrator, the police had re-investigated the case. The evidence chain had become clearer and everything was going in the right direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Right direction&hellip;' Grace's eyes fell on her right hand which was tapping the keyboard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was the hand that slapped Jason last night. It was the same hand he held carefully while asking her, "Does it hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his stomach ache had seemed to hurt more than her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I wonder if he felt better after taking the medicine?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh, I'm thinking about him again!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head to stop herself from thinking about Jason. 'Jason is just a passer-by in my life. I never need to take his matters to heart!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence was anxiously pacing back and forth in front of the mourning hall in Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed had been inside for three hours and was still not out. Several important meetings that were supposed to be held today had been put off to another day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed seemed a little unusual after leaving Grace's rental house today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence wanted to call Grace and ask what happened last night that triggered Master Reed to come back early in the morning and go to the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed seldom entered the mourning hall except on certain days!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stood in front of his father's memorial tablet in the mourning hall, looking at it quietly. His back was straight, and his handsome face was full of loneliness and self-mockery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After some time, he murmured, "Do you regret it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was asking his father's memorial tablet whether he regretted falling in love with a woman like his mother and choosing death so easily&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Alas, a memorial tablet could not give him any answers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he regretted it. He regretted breaking up with Grace. He regretted that he thought he could control his feelings and stop loving her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps some things were already out of his control the moment he fell in love with her.</p></div>
