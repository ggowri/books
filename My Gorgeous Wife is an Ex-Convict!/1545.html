        <h1>Chapter 1543</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had selfishly traded their children's lives for his. Fortunately, their children were alive. Even though one child was still missing, she firmly believed that the child was alive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes twinkled. He never believed in women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His father was so convinced that his mother loved him that he lost his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, he would not believe a woman because it meant that he might get betrayed. If he did not believe in a woman, he would never have to feel the pain of being betrayed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then tell me what was the reason you left so we can know whether or not it&rsquo;s as I thought,&rdquo; said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I..." Grace pressed her lips together and could only say, "I can't remember because of my memory loss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This was true. She only learned the truth about her departure today from Terrence and Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The sarcasm in his dark eyes grew stronger. "Really? Then tell me when you remember."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She glared at him. He loved her. He almost lost his mind after she fell into the ocean! He might have forgotten all that, but... had his feelings for her vanished as well?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not like the irony and sarcasm in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace suddenly felt an impulse in her heart. The next moment, her body suddenly leaned toward him. Jason was caught off guard as Grace pressed him onto the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was on top while he was on the bottom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had one hand on the couch's armrest and the other on his side. It was as if she was holding him captive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason narrowed his eyes slightly. The position made him uncomfortable. He was not used to looking at others from this angle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next moment, she kissed him hard on the lips. It was harder than the kiss in the car and even with a sense of urgency to prove something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What&rsquo;s there to prove? Is she trying to prove that she loves me?' Jason pressed his thin lips together tightly, not wanting to be at the mercy of the woman again as he had previously been in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she persisted as though she was hell-bent on him. Her teeth gnawed on his lips while the tip of her tongue tried to pry them open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'This woman...' Jason's eyes twinkled. Her scent seemed to be charming him. Even her fingers were caressing his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'No!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was always on alert. He had already made an exception when he let his daughter put her arms around his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even so, he trembled slightly as Grace&rsquo;s fingers caressed him. Even... his body was reacting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if every pore of his body welcomed her and was attached to her.</p></div>
