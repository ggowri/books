        <h1>Chapter 4259 I want a divorce</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina returned to the Stephenson family alone and locked herself in her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This worried Hadwin and Lina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did something happen in the Hunter family? Why didn't Chandler accompany Tina back?" Lina asked. In the past, Chandler would always accompany their daughter and send her back to the Stephenson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina didn't seem alright when she came back. Something must have happened," Hadwin said, "I'll go to the Hunter family tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wait!" Lina said, "Let me ask Tina first. Let's not blow this out of proportion."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her husband really went to the Hunter family, what could have been just an issue between the two children would turn into a problem involving two families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadwin sighed, "Alright, you go ask. If the Hunter family said or did something inappropriate to Tina, then I'll go to the Hunter family and demand an explanation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina stood outside her daughter's room and knocked on the door, but there was no response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, the door was not locked, so Lina pushed it open and entered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she entered the room, she saw her daughter watching videos of her and Chandler when they were young.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you suddenly watching these?" Lina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just wanted to watch," Tina whispered. Once, watching these videos filled her with warmth, but now, it felt ironic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From the beginning, Chandler's kindness towards her was only to break the curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All the romance and happiness were just illusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Chandler eventually fell in love with her, how much of it was genuine, and how much of it was fake?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did something happen in the Hunter family?" Lina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's eyelashes trembled, "I just found out some things."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't specify what exactly happened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina understood that her daughter didn't want to talk about it, so she gently touched her head, "If you've been wronged in the Hunter family, tell your parents. The Stephenson family won't be bullied. We've worked hard to gain wealth and status just so you can have a more secure future and more choices!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing her mother's words, Tina's eyes couldn't help but turn red. She took a deep breath and said, "Mom, I haven't been mistreated in the Hunter family, so don't worry. I just want a divorce!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Lina was shocked, "You want a divorce?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her daughter had lost her memory and no longer had feelings for Chandler, didn't they get along well recently?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and Hadwin thought that the two children would have a fresh start, but now there was suddenly a twist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that something had indeed happened when Tina went to the Hunter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it okay?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew very well that if she really wanted to divorce Chandler, it would be a big deal for both the Stephenson family and the Hunter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This marriage was not something that could be easily dissolved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina remained silent for a moment, "Have you thought it through? If you've really made up your mind, then your dad and I will support you. Like I said before, everything we've worked for is to give you more choices. Even if the Hunter family is unhappy later on, your dad and I can handle it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's nose tingled, and she suddenly hugged Lina, "Mom, thank you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, she truly felt the warmth and protection from her family. No matter what she </span><span>faced, her family would always be her solid backing!</span></p></div>
