        <h1>Chapter 417</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason continued drinking his cup of coffee leisurely like he was just casually tasting it. He was chatting with Brian instead of talking about something that could cause mayhem in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian slowly diminished the gleam in his eyes and once again took a sip of his coffee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tension between the two of them was gone and it was like a gathering between friends now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was a little overwhelmed for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other customers, especially women, looked at the pair from time to time. They both looked like celebrities. One woman even tried to pull out her phone to photograph them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman had just aimed her phone at Jason and Brian. Before she could press the button to take the photo, she was stopped by a big hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Jason's bodyguard. He said directly to the woman, "The president doesn't like to be photographed. If you insist, then I'll have to escort you out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was dumbstruck. Was this&hellip; a threat?! However, when she saw the bodyguard's deadpan face and burly body, those words of protest were swallowed back into her stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Reason told her that even if she protested, she would be the one humiliated in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman dejectedly paid the bill and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if the rest of the customers had previously thought of sneakily taking a photo of the two, they no longer had the inclination to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace came back on her electric bike. She was stunned when she saw Jason and Brian sitting at the same table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was... Uh, what was going on? What the hell were they doing here? Judging from the way they looked... They were having coffee?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People like them would not come here for coffee even if they wanted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a bit overwhelmed for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn hurried forward and pulled Grace over, saying, "Mr. Hart is here for you, Grace." Kyla Corbyn did not know what Jason was here for because he had not mentioned it, so she did not talk about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before Brian could get up, Jason stood up and walked straight toward Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you here?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm done with my work at the office and wanted to see you," answered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at the two of them in surprise. "Do you&hellip; know this gentleman, Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, yes. He's..." Grace suddenly paused as she said this. She did not know how to introduce him all of a sudden. After all, although she was dating Jason, she had never made her relationship public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmm? What's the matter? Aren't you going to introduce me to the owner of this restaurant?" Jason looked at Grace with a smile.</p></div>
