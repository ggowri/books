        <h1>Chapter 1057</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With those dark phoenix eyes of his staring at the moving car, Brian's handsome face was full of anxiety and gloom. 'Is Jason trying to show that he can take anyone he wants?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace, who was stuffed into the back seat, pulled herself up and asked, "Jason, what do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do I want?" The man sitting next to her sneered, and he looked at her with those stunning eyes of his. The way he looked at her was like fire and ice. It gave her a sense of extreme danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace trembled slightly. The next moment, Jason suddenly leaned over with his arms pressed on both sides of her body, almost imprisoning her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A barrier slowly rose between the back seat and the front seat at the same time, effectively separating the space in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The backseat, which was larger than a normal car&rsquo;s, suddenly became a single space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A flicker of panic flashed across Grace's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face approached hers. "Is Brian that great? Is he that great that you couldn't wait to put on the gown he prepared for you and even hugged him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was unrepressed jealousy on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, he was jealous, madly jealous! He had never felt so jealous before, but he could not help his heart from bursting when he saw the photos sent by the bodyguards assigned to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Dressed in a purple floral gown, she hugged Brian! She didn't seem to be struggling in even the slightest in the photo. You could say that... she did it willingly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Has she fallen for Brian?' The mere thought of it seemed to engulf him with jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew that Brian had a habit of collecting purple floral dresses, which was one of the unspoken secrets in their circle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick had once asked curiously, "Brian, who are you going to give this collection of purple floral dresses to?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Someone I miss the most." That was what Brian had said at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, Jason just smiled as he listened, thinking it was a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he saw Brian's painting of the little girl wearing a floral dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, he saw a photo of Grace as a child in a floral dress!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was then he knew that the floral dresses Brian was collecting were for Grace. The person he missed was Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even after Stella appeared, Brian still let Grace wear a purple floral gown... It was as if he had given it to the one he missed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face was getting closer and closer to Grace's, and his lips were almost touching hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She jerked away from his kiss, her heart reeling with shock. 'He knows that Brian had hugged me tonight?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did he see it? Or&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her dodging did not have the slightest effect. The next moment, he kissed her hard on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace struggled hard but still could not avoid the kiss that followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could smell him. He grabbed her hands and wrists so tightly that she could not break free at all. An unchaste atmosphere filled the car!</p></div>
