        <h1>Chapter 693</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I want you," her red lips said the words as he had wished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, his body covered her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay looked at her phone and could not find what she had seen before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The news of Brian holding Grace's hand suddenly broke out on the internet, and she only found the photos on the news offensive to the eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'In Brian's mind, I should be the one who saved him! Why did he have to rescue Grace in public and even drag Grace into his car?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the photo, the way he looked at Grace... Was as if... He cared more about her than anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Brian knows that Grace is the one he&rsquo;s looking for&hellip;' Stella Lindsay did not dare to think more about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a voice suddenly rang out, "Hey, why is someone still staring at their phone? The latest gossip about the crown prince has long been removed from the web. He must&rsquo;ve done it to protect the woman!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, another voice said in agreement, "That's right. Someone thought she could get into a rich and powerful family because she saved the crown prince when she was little. Who does she think she is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Exactly. Does she think she's cultured just because she got into a university? She couldn&rsquo;t have stepped into this university if it weren't for the crown prince."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay turned around to look and saw that the ones speaking were her university classmates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had asked Brian to get her into this university.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was a famous aristocratic university in Emerald City, and those who could study here were either rich or aristocratic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it also made her look a little out of place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she wore designer clothes and carried a limited-edition bag worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, she was still just a country bumpkin in her classmates' eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she did not dare to do anything about it, so she tried her best to show off her relationship with Brian in front of her classmates. She had also asked Brian to pick her up from the university several times before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not refuse her request and went along with her wishes. He picked her up from the university, which made her popular.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Supposedly, he was coming to pick her up today. As such, she slipped her tongue on purpose to let the whole class know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she received a bunch of envious and jealous glances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, who would have thought that when the time came, Brian did not show up. Instead, she saw the news about him and Grace on her phone and was ridiculed by her classmates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, are we wrong?" One of the classmates raised her chin in triumph when she saw Stella Lindsay looking over. "Who does she think she is? Does she think she can be the crown prince's girlfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay bit her lip, ran out of the university, and stopped a taxi. She got into it and told the driver the address of Brian's private mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the mansion's gate, the servant opened the door to let Stella Lindsay in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the living room, Stella Lindsay saw Brian sitting on the couch with an empty wine bottle and another half-empty wine bottle in front of him. In his hand, he was holding a goblet filled with wine the color of blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body was leaning precariously against the couch, the front part of his shirt wide open to reveal his chest.</p></div>
