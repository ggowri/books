        <h1>Chapter 564</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reason immediately made her flustered. She did not know whether to cry or laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was also a feast for her eyes to look at him quietly. She had never thought that one day, the two of them would be able to get along in this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was exceptionally focused when he was working, leafing through the documents while the pen in his hand was constantly moving while making notes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could see that he read quickly, and at the same time, he was occasionally giving follow-up orders to the top management at the other end of the computer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Jason, Grace suddenly felt rueful. She used to hear people say that men were actually the most attractive when they were at work. It seemed to be true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone knew Jason as the king of the business world because he came from a wealthy and century-old family, but no one was born a king. Even if he had the Reed family as support, he could still be dethroned at any time if he did not work hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Reed family's current development and consolidation of his own position were all his hard work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's gaze fell on Jason's profile. From her point of view, she could see his straight nose bridge, clear facial outlines, sexy thin lips, and firm chin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyelids were now half-drooped. He was looking at the papers before him while his long lashes formed a pretty shadow on his lower eyelids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were extremely beautiful. When this pair of eyes stared at her, they glistened like it was full of charm and flirtation. She could not help but want to see them again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;I like your eyes.&rsquo; The words flashed through her mind suddenly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was immediately stunned, and there seemed to be a dull ache in her head again. Had she said this to anyone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Brian's tearful eyes flashed through her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">God. Why did she think of Brian? Grace shook her head vigorously, trying to shake off the image of Brian in her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Why do you keep shaking your head?" Out of the blue, a voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Grace looked up, she saw that Jason had walked up to her from the desk at some point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing," she answered as she bit her lower lip slightly, not wanting to talk about the incident with Brian. After all, Brian was clearly drunk tonight and probably did not know what he was doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she had a feeling that Brian mistook her for someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, the Hart family and the Reed family had always shared a good relationship. Brian and Jason seemed to have been playmates since childhood. She did not want to cause trouble between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Let's pretend tonight never happened.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason was not satisfied with her answer. He raised his eyebrow slightly while his finger raised her chin. "Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark eyes seemed to be able to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was just thinking, you... Probably don&rsquo;t cry much." She tried hard to give a reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the more absurd the reason was, the easier it was to convince him. He could not help laughing. "Why? Do you really want to see me cry?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." How was she supposed to answer that? If he cried one day, then she would... Grace's heart suddenly tingled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to see him cry, but a strong man like him had his moments of vulnerability too. Just like every time he talked about his parents, he would make her feel like he was a fragile glass that would shatter into pieces with the slightest force.</p></div>
