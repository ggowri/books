        <h1>Chapter 259</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," Grace said lightly. "I have a friend waiting for me outside too, so I have to go soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, take it easy." Andrea added. "You don't have a boyfriend now, do you? My boyfriend is a professor at the university and knows a lot of people. Why don't you let him introduce you to a few men?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said as she followed Grace out of the washroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Andrea called out to a man of medium build standing outside the washroom. He promptly came over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the approaching man. He looked average in appearance but was a little older, looking like he was in his late 40s. Obviously, this was Andrea's boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tyler, this is my ex-colleague, Grace. I happened to run into her in the washroom just now," Andrea said. She added. "Grace, this is my boyfriend, Tyler Barber. He is a professor at Yuren University."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea sounded ostentatious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Tyler Barber who hastened to correct her. "I'm only an associate professor, not a professor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In two years you&rsquo;ll be a professor," Andrea said disapprovingly. She then asked Grace, "Didn't you say your friend is waiting for you outside? Where are they?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up and did not see Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Did he leave first?&rsquo; she wondered in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea thought Grace had only said that as an excuse, so she said, "Why don't we find somewhere to sit? We&rsquo;ll let my boyfriend see if he has someone in mind for you. He used to say that marriage is a big problem for some of the workers in the logistics department at his university. There should be someone your age there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea seemed somewhat embarrassed as she said, "You don't mind going on a blind date with workers, do you? I want to introduce you to some of the single lecturers at Tyler&rsquo;s university, but you know those lecturers will usually ask for someone with a clean record. You might have a problem with that, but rest assured, although their logistics workers aren't that well paid and less educated, they&rsquo;re hardworking and don't have much to do with others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her as she said all that and found it funny. She had never said anything about wanting to go on a date, but Andrea seemed to think that she desperately wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want any blind dates." Grace rebuffed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea's eyes widened, and she stared at Grace in disbelief. "You don't mind me introducing you to a logistics worker, do you? Grace, it's not me. You're not the same as you were back then. You&rsquo;ve got to ask for less. If you don't go on blind dates at your age now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, is someone setting you up on a blind date?" A voice suddenly rang in Grace's ear, and it seemed to make Andrea's voice stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, who was wearing a trench coat, walked over to Grace and passed her a glass of milk tea. "I heard you say that you want to try this brand of milk tea. I saw it just now, so I went to get you one. See if you like it. If you don't, we'll go and get another one you like later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the milk tea, which was warm, and held it in her hands. It warmed her hands up a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She glanced at the brand name on the milk tea. She saw it on the news that the milk tea store had come to Emerald City, so she mentioned to him that the milk tea was quite famous on the internet.</p></div>
