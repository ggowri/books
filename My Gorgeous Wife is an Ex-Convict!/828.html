        <h1>Chapter 827</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to escape the feeling in her heart. Since she had fallen for him, she did not want to miss him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Or should she say she did not want to miss him a second time, having already missed him more than three years ago?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her, his beautiful black eyes looking as if he wanted to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want us to have a real relationship?" His voice was slightly hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, you must know that once we&rsquo;re really dating, you can't just leave me whenever you want anymore. I can forgive you for leaving without saying goodbye the last time, but if you leave again without saying goodbye, maybe I'll break your legs so that you can't go anywhere,&rdquo; Hadwin said. Each word sounded like a final warning to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina trembled, her teeth leaving a row of bite marks on her red lower lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, not just leaving without saying goodbye... You don't even have the right to break up with me," said Hadwin. He simply could not imagine letting her go once he had her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would probably not give her a chance to leave him when that happened. He would not let go even if she no longer liked him, or even if she hated him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked at Hadwin in shock, and the bite marks on her red lip became deeper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you hate me in the future, I won't break up even if you cry and beg me on your knees. So, do you still want to date me?" he asked, word by word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His clear voice sounded as beautiful as a crooning cello.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, every word seemed to be so heavy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina discovered that there was a layer of cold sweat on her palms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she had never expected her confession to Hadwin would cause him to say such things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was warning her that if she wanted to run away, she should do it now, and if she missed this opportunity, she would not have any more in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But... Do I want to escape and miss my chance with this man again? Or... Should I bet that we'll never break up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Should I bet that our love will be smooth sailing from here on out?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had never been one to bet on good luck, and she would lose most of her games at poker and mahjong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now she wanted to bet with the rest of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... want to have a real relationship with you!" She heard herself saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina felt that this was the most important decision she had ever made!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like that, they went from having a fake relationship to having a real one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace and Jason had just split up, so she did not tell her best friend about it for the time being. She only planned to tell Grace about it later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, Lina and Grace had a video call. "Have you tried on the clothes and shoes I bought for you? Do they fit?"</p></div>
