        <h1>Chapter 2979</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, a voice suddenly sounded, "It's them! The guy who just hit me, it's him! Spike, you have to help me get revenge!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked up and saw the woman who had just left, now approaching with a group of aggressive-looking people. These people appeared to be street thugs, with some showing their skin and tattoos outside of their clothes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was taken aback when she saw her. Oh my god, is this woman here with these people to seek revenge?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The people sitting next to them noticed and all showed a look of wanting to stay far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The shop owner quickly walked over, hoping that if there was really going to be a fight, it would at least happen outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then let's go outside and fight," Brian said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What? Valda thought he must have misheard. He was alone and the other side had at least seven or eight people. How could he fight them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And those people were amused, "Haha, you want to act like a big shot, huh? We'll see how we can knock you, this pretty boy, down later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Brian raised his hand and elegantly unbuttoned his coat, then handed it to Valda, saying "Please help me keep my coat for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You...you really want to fight with them?" Valda was dumbfounded, her eyes filled with worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, I can handle it. I won't pick a fight unless I'm sure I can win," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But the problem is, she currently feels very uncertain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was extremely worried, but Brian had already walked out of the store with those people. The woman looked at Valda with a mocking expression and said, "Ha, when that man is beaten to a pulp, it'll be your turn! What kind of taste does he have to choose a woman like you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Valda is too lazy to pay attention to the other person's sarcastic remarks. Her only concern is Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took out her phone and dialed 110, the emergency police number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a short while, the call was connected and she quickly explained the situation. However, as soon as the woman saw Valda making the emergency call, she rushed over to try and snatch the phone away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda ran awkwardly inside the store while making a phone call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Please quickly provide your address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing the call, the woman caught up with Valda and exclaimed, "You should call the police! I'm telling you to call the police!" She then lunged towards Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda couldn't show weakness at this point, so she immediately raised her hand and the two women started fighting inside the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Women fighting is different from men fighting. It involves pulling, scratching, and grabbing with their nails.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda is now regretting not having grown her nails, as they would have been a useful weapon in a fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The shop owner and two women got into a fight in the store. The owner quickly intervened with his staff to break it up, but it only made the situation more chaotic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I don't know how much time had passed until a shout came, "Police! All of you, stop!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda and the woman finally stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked up and saw a person wearing a police uniform standing right outside the store's entrance.</p></div>
