        <h1>Chapter 2516</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two nurses froze. Moments later, they came back to their senses. "You have type-B blood?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then come with us, but you need a blood test before you can donate," the nurse said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell nodded her head, showing that she understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Amber Mitchell followed one of the nurses to the blood-drawing room, there were already some doctors and nurses inside. Some of them held cotton balls to one part of their arms. It seemed that they had just gotten their blood drawn. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell rolled up the sleeve of her left hand, exposing her left arm while she kept the glove on her right hand. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to the missing finger on her right hand, she had formed the habit of wearing gloves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A tube of blood was drawn from her arm. The results would be out in 15 minutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The child needed a transfusion every time his illness recurred, so he had to use a lot of blood. Three medical workers there also donated their blood, and they could not help but applaud Amber Mitchell's decision to donate blood when she was only passing by and heard that a child needed blood badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are fewer and fewer people like you now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If more people are willing to donate their blood on a whim, blood banks won&rsquo;t run out of blood every year."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell smiled faintly. "I think it's good to help people in need."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If her blood could save a child, she would feel that the life that Herman had saved could be of some use.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The test results soon came back, and the three nurses arranged for Amber Mitchell to donate blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell slowly closed her eyes as she saw the red blood flow through the transparent tube into the plastic bag. She only hoped that the child would be okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could imagine how serious the child's illness was if they needed a transfusion at such a young age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all she could do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Mitchell, tell us if you feel any discomfort. Because it's an emergency, we'll draw more blood today, but we'll keep it within the normal range. However, you might feel tired in the next few days after having your blood drawn," the nurse said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it," replied Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Blood flowed from her body, and she seemed to slowly drift into a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seemed to have gone back to the time of that car accident. Herman was protecting her with his body, and the warm blood dripped down Herman's forehead onto her face and body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a feeling she would never forget.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometime later, she was done getting her blood drawn. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse gave her a red envelope. "This is a red envelope from the patient's father. He's grateful for your help today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I didn't donate my blood for compensation." Amber Mitchell declined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We know you didn't donate your blood for compensation, but the patient's family is just trying to show their gratitude. Besides, you need to buy some supplements to replenish your body after donating your blood. You'll get a basic subsidy for regular blood donation too," the nurse said as they put the red envelope in Amber Mitchell's hand. "Just take it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you help me return it to the patient's family?" Amber Mitchell asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well..." The nurse seemed stumped. "The patient's family never take back what they&rsquo;ve given away."</p></div>
