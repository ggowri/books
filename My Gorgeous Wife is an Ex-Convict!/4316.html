        <h1>Chapter 4314 Unexpected Actions</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other person stared at Harley in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Helping oneself?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is there still a need for self-rescue in a life like his?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A complete mess of misery, pitiful!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And standing in front of him at this moment is a true princess!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knows of her existence, even in this school full of wealthy people, she still attracts attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she is the princess of the Hart family, the daughter of the entertainment industry's moguls that many people want to get close to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people want to flatter and please her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to think that such a person was far away from him and beyond his reach in his lifetime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he didn't expect that, at this very moment, the distance between them would be so close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing the other party remain silent, just staring at her blankly, Harley furrowed her brow. She leaned in closer and asked, "Did you hear that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young man finally snapped out of it and awkwardly replied, "Yes, I heard."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then you should go to the hospital now," she said. He had been beaten up and needed to see a doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need," he quickly insisted, trying to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the place where he had just been hit was hurting badly. He took only two steps before stumbling and falling forward, about to hit the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley quickly reached out and offered, "How are you? Should I call a taxi to take you to the hospital?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she had helped him before, so she wanted to help him completely!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the other person refused again, saying, "No need."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want to go to the hospital? But your injury..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have money. Going to the hospital costs a lot, it's not necessary," the boy said, lowering his head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was taken aback. She wasn't a princess who didn't understand the hardships of the world. On the contrary, because of her mother's humble background, she was well aware of the lives of ordinary people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in this school, most students came from wealthy families. Even those with poor family conditions wouldn't be so destitute as to not afford medical treatment if they could attend this school.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So when the boy in front of her said he couldn't go to the hospital because he didn't have money, she was truly stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for helping me. Goodbye," the boy said simply, intending to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Harley didn't let go of his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy looked at Harley with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley said, "Let me take you to the hospital, I'll pay for the medical expenses."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Karen exclaimed, "Harley, seriously? Just give him some money if he doesn't have any. There's no need for you to personally take him to the hospital."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The boy lowered his eyes, hiding a fleeting hint of sarcasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>People like them, who were wealthy, usually just used money to dismiss the poor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In their eyes, all the poor people need is money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was about to refuse again when he heard Harley say, "I'll take him to the hospital, Karen, you go ahead!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, Harley looked at the young boy and asked, "Are you okay? Can you still walk? I'll support you and we can take a taxi to the school gate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The young boy was stunned, and it took him a while to lift his head and look at Harley, nodding slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley, why do you have to do this?" Karen kept nagging.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley ignored her friend and supported the young boy, walking towards the school gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Along the way, Harley's act of supporting someone caught the attention of many passersby and made them curious about the identity of this young boy with a swollen and bruised face. They wondered how he could be supported by the princess of the Hart family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the school gate, Harley hailed a taxi and took the boy to the hospital!</span></p></div>
