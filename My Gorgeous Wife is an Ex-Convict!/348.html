        <h1>Chapter 347</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Grace asked in confusion as Jason stopped in his tracks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing," Jason replied dryly with his head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How are you feeling now?" asked Grace when they returned to the main house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Much better," he answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if your stomachache is an old problem, you still have to go to the doctor to get it fixed when you're free," said Grace. "Some illnesses are minor ones that we don't pay attention to and they'll eventually develop into something serious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you worried about me, Sis?" he said as a smile rose from the corners of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She choked and wanted to go upstairs. She was a little embarrassed. However, he suddenly raised his hand and took her directly into his arms. "All right, I promise you. I'll find the time to find a doctor and get my body in order. I'll also be good and take the medicine you bought me today. Would you like me a little more if I listened to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" She was a little stunned. What was he saying? Did he really just say that? Oh God. How was that possible? How could a man like him say something like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lowered his head. With his face close to hers, he said in a voice that sounded like a double bass, "Would you like me more if I listened to you? I want you to like me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, he wanted her to like him. All he wanted was for her to stay with him, but when did he start to get greedy and want more?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not enough to keep her by his side. He wanted her to like him. He wanted her to like him alone. He wanted her to have feelings for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you?" He sounded just like the devil's most magnificent enchantment, beckoning her to agree to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at the man in front of her, her mind seemingly going blank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word &lsquo;yes&rsquo; almost came out of her mouth...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had a restless night with Jason's words flashing through her mind every now and then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was hard to imagine how he could say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even wondered what it would have been like if she had said &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only looked at him stupidly and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, he did not want an answer but said to her, "You can tell me when you're willing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time she woke up in the morning, Jason was no longer in the house. It was a relief to her. Grace only had to work half-day on Saturday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the afternoon, Grace collected her things and headed for the place she had agreed with Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she reached the place, Lina was already there. Her friend was sitting on a chair in the dessert shop. She was holding a phone to her ear with a long face, seemingly listening to someone on the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that Grace had reached, Lina beckoned her to sit down and said to the other end of the phone, "All right, all right. I promise to complete the revolutionary task today. Is that all right? Mom, just stop calling me and&hellip; How about this? If I come home tonight without completing the task, you can punish me by making me kneel on the keyboard!"</p></div>
