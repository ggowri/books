        <h1>Chapter 1381</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was now standing here as a different person from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked to Jason's desk, only to see many documents on it. She could almost imagine how busy he usually was when sitting in front of this desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her eyes fell on one of the documents on the desk. On the cover were the words &lsquo;Atkinson Garden&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered Atkinson Garden being one of the Atkinson family's properties. It was an important project in the Atkinson family's recent foray into real estate. It was said that they had spent ten billion dollars to buy this land. In the past two years, the Atkinson family had greatly publicized this land, which showed just how important this project was to the Atkinson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... why was this document on Jay&rsquo;s desk?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was wondering about it when the office door suddenly opened. Startled, she accidentally swept an envelope on the desk to the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The contents of the envelope spilled onto the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned when she saw what had fallen out of the envelope. It was... a stack of photos, and the person in all the photos was a woman&mdash;Jennifer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jay&rsquo;s former fianc&eacute;e, the Atkinson family's heiress!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why were these photos on his desk?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jennifer, the woman who had almost married Jay, had died in a car accident. It was not even clear whether Grace and Jay would have met if the car accident never happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could say that the car accident had changed many people's lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace was in her trance, a hand picked up the photos on the floor. 'It's... Jay&rsquo;s hand!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly as Jason bent over and picked up the photos as well as the envelope on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." She felt a sudden dryness in her throat. "I just saw Lina in the hospital, and I wanted to see you since it's still early."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How's Lina?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good... She's doing much better than I expected. She's now cooperating with the treatment," said Grace. Seeing Jason put the photos back into the envelope, she could not help saying, "These photos..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you mind them?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you have photos of Jennifer here?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Do I mind? Actually, I do mind a little.' After all, Jennifer was the woman who had almost become Jay&rsquo;s wife. However, Jennifer was no longer alive, and she knew she was the one Jay had in his heart now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;However... why are there photos of Jennifer on his desk? Does he miss Jennifer?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason replied, "They&rsquo;re from the Atkinson family. I'll have someone send them back to the Atkinson family later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did the Atkinson family suddenly send you Jennifer's photos?" Grace asked, puzzled. After all, Jennifer was already dead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said with a half-smile, "Probably to remind me not to forget her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A chill flashed across his eyes as he said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, Grace looked somewhat blankly at the person in front of her. She seemed to feel a sense of danger around him right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if noticing her gaze, Jason's aura suddenly changed. He quickly returned to how he usually was with her&mdash;gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, don't overthink it. I have nothing to do with Jennifer. I only chose her to be my fianc&eacute;e because Grandpa thought she was suitable for the Reed family," he said as he gently took her hand in his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace chuckled. "I don't mind. After all, that&rsquo;s all in the past. Besides, didn't I have a boyfriend too back then?"</p></div>
