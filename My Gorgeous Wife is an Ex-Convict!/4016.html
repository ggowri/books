        <h1>Chapter 4014</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When her fingers finally touched his face, a cold sensation was transmitted through her fingertips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face was so cold!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's so good to see you in my dreams," she said. "If this is a dream, I hope it can last a little longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not a dream...this isn't a dream, it's me, I found you, I finally found you!" Mick said, gently pressing Nancy's hand back and rubbing his cheek in her palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, I finally found you...you're alive, it's good that you're alive, it's good that you're alive..." A choked voice came from his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two clear tears fell from the corners of his eyes, wetting her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned, staring blankly at the person who was so close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sensation in her palm was so real.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this really not a dream? Is it...reality?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy originally thought that even if someone from Emerald City came looking for her, it would most likely be the police or someone from the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she didn't expect Mick to come in person, and even...cry in front of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kind of Mick was beyond her previous imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Nancy was still in shock as she looked at the Reed family who appeared in her hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not only Mick, but also Mick's parents, Jasper, and William came to visit her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was particularly emotional and tearful. "Nancy, it's great that you're alive. You have no idea how hard we've been looking for you for the past five months!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy didn't know if she should be amazed or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From last night until now, she had already seen two members of the Reed family cry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This situation was not something that many people could have predicted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry, I was unconscious before and didn't know you were looking for me," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't apologize, I should be the one apologizing!" Jasper said. "If it weren't for me being so useless, you wouldn't have had to jump like that. You jumped to save me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper said seriously, "Nancy, from now on, no matter what happens, I will stand by your side. If you have any difficulties, I will help you solve them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No...there's no need for that. Anyway, Irene didn't plan to let me go that day. I just didn't want to let her off the hook!" Nancy quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's promise was too precious and not something she could accept.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if Irene didn't plan to let you go, the fact is that you saved Jasper from danger," Jason said. "The Reed family owes you a great debt of gratitude and we will naturally repay you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy bit her lip. "You've already done so much for me by letting me stay in this great hospital and having expert doctors diagnose me. I'm very grateful, and I don't need anything else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" Jason said. "You can ask for a lot, even if you want a share of the Reed family's stocks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, no!" Nancy quickly refused. "I...I just want to get better and be able to leave the hospital smoothly...that's all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason said, "Once your health improves, we will arrange for you to receive better treatment in Emerald City. Plus, it will be easier for Mick to take care of you there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go back to Emerald City?" Nancy was taken aback. After a moment of silence, she said, "Thank you for your kindness, but I don't plan on going back to Emerald City."</p></div>
