        <h1>Chapter 1023</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, Kyla Corbyn hurried forward and apologized to smooth things over. "Why don't I cook you a new one? Dinner's on me the next time you come here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that all you're going to do to settle this? There are flies in your dish! What if we ate your food and got hospitalized? What about the medical bills? Besides, we wouldn't dare eat your cooking again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop talking nonsense. Make her pay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's right. Pay up! Forget about doing business here if you don't pay us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three men spoke, and one of them deliberately held a dead fly in his hand in front of Kyla Corbyn's face as if it was a piece of physical evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of the customers who had been eating also stopped to look on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Kyla Corbyn knew that the three men were blackmailing her, but she had no evidence to prove that they planted the fly. She could only say through gritted teeth, "Why don't I compensate you 200 dollars?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This 200 dollars was nearly as much as she earned from a night's work!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they were not satisfied with 200 dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"200 dollars? Do you think we're beggars?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's right. You should at least give us 50,000 dollars. If you don't have 50,000 dollars, forget about doing business here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;50,000 dollars&hellip;' There was no way Kyla Corbyn could come up with that kind of money!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was so mad when she heard this. "50,000 dollars? Why don't you just rob someone? God knows if you're the one who planted the fly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? Are you saying we're blackmailing her?" he said fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, you are!" grumbled Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I found a fly in your food, and this is the physical evidence. Can you prove that it wasn't from your cooking?" he said shamelessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was so pissed off by the three scoundrels!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace said, "We have no way to prove whether you planted the fly or whether it was in the food, but we can prove that you're blackmailing us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace picked up her phone as she said, "I recorded you asking for 50,000 dollars just now. I'm going to call the police. Let's see how the police handle this once they're here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she dialed 110.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three men were furious!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of them tipped the table over, spilling dishes and chopsticks all over the floor. This caused those around them to scream while the customers who had been enjoying their meal quickly fled the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three of them threatened to hit Grace and Lina. Kyla Corbyn hurried to protect them. After all, it had nothing to do with them. Therefore, she could not let Grace and Lina get hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You guys should go first!" said Kyla Corbyn.</p></div>
