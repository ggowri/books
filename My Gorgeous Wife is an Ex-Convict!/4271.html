        <h1>Chapter 4269 Don't Let Him Misunderstand Anymore</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it's also possible that I misunderstood, and you were just asking casually, not </span><span>really concerned!" Chandler's voice continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I am genuinely concerned!" Tina blurted out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Tina was stunned. Did she really worry about him? He approached her and treated her well for a reason, and she should hate him, shouldn't she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Choosing to divorce was also because of this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why did she still worry about him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing Tina's words, Chandler showed a bitter smile. "Tina, don't say these things to me anymore. Since you don't love me, since you don't want to be with me, then don't say things that will make me misunderstand in the future!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That would only make it harder for him to suppress his feelings for her, and in the end, it would only make them both more miserable!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina uncomfortably bit her lip. "I just don't want there to be anything wrong with your health. After all, we have known each other for so many years, and my parents told me that during the time I was missing, you were not in good health because of looking for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler said calmly, "Then you can rest assured. There's nothing wrong with my health. I just talked to the attending physician, and I should be discharged tomorrow."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina breathed a sigh of relief. If he could be discharged, then everything should be fine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you're fine, I'll go back now," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she turned and walked towards the elevator, she heard Chandler's voice behind her. "Tina, if it's not necessary in the future, don't greet me, don't care about me. Just treat me as a stranger, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only if she disregarded him could he have no expectations, and only then could he properly control his emotions and continue to live!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Otherwise, he was afraid he couldn't suppress these feelings and would end up doing something to hurt her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's body stiffened suddenly. After a while, she replied softly, "Alright, I understand."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she walked out of the hospital and got into the car, she heard the driver's surprised voice, "Miss Stephenson, why are you crying?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina </span><span>paused,</span><span> did I cry?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she cry again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She raised her hand and touched her face, which was already wet with tears!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turned out that even though she had made up her mind to separate from him, even though she had actually done so, when she heard him speak in such a cold voice, treating him as a stranger, she felt so miserable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine, maybe my emotions have been a bit unstable lately." Tina took a tissue and wiped away the tears on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In a few days, she should give the divorce agreement to the lawyer to handle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Chandler wants her to treat him as a stranger in the future, then it's best for her as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they still have Quinn between them, as long as he is Quinn's father, it's enough. As for her and Chandler, they can pretend to be friends even after the divorce, but other than that, they are just strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, she lost her memory and hasn't truly fallen in love with him, so she only knows the fact that he approached her with a purpose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This way, even if it hurts, it's limited.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because she still has time to withdraw her feelings for him!</span></p></div>
