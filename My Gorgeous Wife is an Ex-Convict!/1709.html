        <h1>Chapter 1707</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla said frankly, "Yes, we're not. Not now, not ever. We&rsquo;ll never get back together.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He made a mistake, but won&rsquo;t he be able to win your heart again even if he spends the rest of his life trying?&rdquo; asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay!" said Grace, scared that Kyla would be offended by Jason being too straightforward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Somewhat uncharacteristically, Jason continued to stare at Kyla as if wanting to hear her answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla said, "I&rsquo;ll never love him again, even if he spends the rest of his life making it up to me and repenting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She spoke with such determination!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's brows furrowed slightly. "Why? He hurt you because he was deceived. He didn&rsquo;t do it intentionally."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla said, "But he did it on purpose at first. He approached me and made me fall in love with him with another motive in mind. Also, he had every opportunity to investigate the truth, but he didn't. He preferred to believe that I was a villain who was responsible for everything. Even if I did have feelings for him, they&rsquo;ve long since died from the pain he has caused me. Some mistakes will last for a lifetime, and some feelings change with no way to turn them back around.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes darkened, and his face seemed to be enveloped with a layer of gloom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace quickly tugged at him and said to Kyla, "Kyla, I'm sorry. Don't mind what Jay had said."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It&rsquo;s alright. There's nothing I can't say about what has happened with Martin Weiss and me," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, someone came to pay for their things. Kyla greeted the customer. Grace whispered to Jason, "Why did you ask Kyla these?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Nothing, I'm just asking," said Jason. Martin Weiss had made a mistake that disappointed Kyla greatly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What about him? He had committed a mistake too, but Grace was still by his side! However, the memories he was missing haunted him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before long, the tiny figure walked toward the school gate again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was Mason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace and Jason walked to the school gate as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just like before, the little one walked up to the school's iron gate and squatted down to wait quietly. His face appeared completely indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even when Grace and Jason stood beside him, he seemed to ignore them as though they were invisible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace crouched down and said, "Mason, remember me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one slowly turned his head to look at Grace and nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"This is my husband. You can call him Uncle Reed," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it was spoken in vain because the little one had no intention of greeting Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Did your sister apply the medicine for you? Do you feel any better?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"She did, but I'm not in pain." His childlike voice seemed to speak with some confusion. He did not understand why he felt no pain, but his sister said he had to apply the medicine on his bruises so that they would heal quickly.</p></div>
