        <h1>Chapter 3526</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica found out about the reason why Mason was so cold to her after returning to the country by accidentally overhearing a private conversation between her parents and Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hypnosis!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turns out that there is such a hypnosis that can remember everything, but weaken the emotions involved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She clearly heard her father ask Mason, "How could you bear to do such hypnosis at that time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because at that time, I felt that if I didn't do this hypnosis, I might not be able to survive," was Mason's reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could he not survive?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Had Mason's feelings for Sister Veronica reached such a deep level at that time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, she hoped that Sister Veronica and Mason could reconcile, or that Sister Veronica could really become Mason's girlfriend. But now, after all that has happened, it seems unlikely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason no longer has feelings for Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the trial, all the kidnappers were sentenced to 7-15 years in prison. As for Lionel, because he was a minor and there was evidence that his initial intention was only a fake kidnapping, and Jasper and Veronica both issued forgiveness letters for Lionel, he was released on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer and Rosalind were crying and laughing while holding their son, and Veronica stood aside, looking like an outsider.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper wanted to go over and talk to Veronica with some concern, but William next to him pulled him back and said, "Don't go over there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what about Veronica?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you go over there now, it will only make her more embarrassed and uncomfortable. Besides, with the situation between you, Mason, and her, what do you plan to say to her? Are you going to tell her not to mind it or tell her to go find Mason?" William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was speechless, as if neither option was appropriate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is between her and Mason. You are just an outsider. It's not good to get involved," William continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He also learned about the hypnosis incident from Jasper yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After learning about it, he couldn't help but admire Mason's determination to make such a difficult decision. Perhaps only someone who has liked someone before would understand how much courage Mason needed to make that decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Jasper hesitated for a moment, but ultimately decided to leave with William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they walked outside the courthouse, Jasper asked, "Do you think hypnosis can really completely diminish one's emotions? Even if they remember everything that happened, can they still detach themselves from it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know," William replied, "but judging from how Mason is treating Veronica now, it seems to be the case."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If Mason really likes Veronica, why doesn't he try to win her over again? Maybe if he tries again, Veronica won't just see him as a little brother!" Jasper frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's because in this world, there are some things that can't be obtained just by trying," William said. Just like him, he was uncertain about whether he could truly be with her in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So...William, if we ever have an argument in the future, would you choose to hypnotize and forget our feelings for each other?" Jasper asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was afraid that one day he would make the same choice as Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I wouldn't," William paused his steps and looked at Jasper walking beside him. "Even if we argue and I get angry or upset, I would never make that kind of choice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Her eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," he said, because he couldn't bear to give up this feeling he had for her, even if it would be painful in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let's pinky swear!" Jasper said immediately.</p></div>
