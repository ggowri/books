        <h1>Chapter 2422</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that further questioning would not lead to anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, rest well. Call me if you need anything," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Kyla smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace left, Kyla smiled ruefully at the silent room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was suddenly a movement in her belly. It was the baby kicking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla raised her hand and caressed her belly. "Baby, I'm sorry I can't give you a complete family, but I just want your daddy to be alive and well. At least that way... your daddy won't be too sad when I'm gone one day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not even know how much time she had left. Maybe she only had a few years. How long would her transplanted liver last after she gave birth?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything was like a knife hanging over her head, and it was about to drop at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want her loved one to die with her when the moment came!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss drank alone in a bar in Deer City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew his mind was a mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he said he had forgotten his feelings and no longer had any love for Kyla, his body seemed to instinctively want to be close to her whenever he saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the love he had for her had been etched into his bones, controlling all his body's reactions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today, he kissed her to prove that he was not attracted to her, but it turned out he almost lost himself in that kiss. If it had not been for that last bit of self-control, he might have done something he despised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I can't help myself... Ha, I can't help myself when it comes to her...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a woman in a tight dress came to Martin Weiss's side. She wore sexy makeup and had a seductive smile on her face. "Sir, why don't I have a drink with you? It's better to drink together than to drink alone, no?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was obviously experienced as she put her hand on Martin Weiss's hand that was holding the glass while she spoke. She intentionally rubbed her fingertips against the back of his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been watching the man for a long time. He was drinking alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the man's clothes, he was obviously rich. Besides, he was handsome. She could gain a lot if she could have some fun with the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman thought up a plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss frowned in disgust and impatiently waved away the woman's hand as he said, "Get lost."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman's smile froze. Then, she moved closer to Martin Weiss and said, "There's no need to be so distant. You seem to have something on your mind. I love listening to people talk about things bothering them, so why don't you tell me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, the woman wrapped her arms around Martin Weiss's neck while her lips approached him as if she was about to kiss him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the unfinished wine in Martin Weiss's hand was splashed onto the woman's face.</p></div>
