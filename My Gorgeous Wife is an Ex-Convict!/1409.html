        <h1>Chapter 1408</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn muttered, "Yeah, he has nothing to do with us anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">News of Paisley Daniels's miscarriage was trending. There was even a video posted on the trending post showing how Kyla Corbyn had pushed Paisley Daniels and how the latter knocked into the table and chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The video showed Paisley Daniels painfully clutching her stomach after being hit by the objects on the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The person who posted the video claimed that they found it unfair, saying they heard that the woman in the video miscarried because of the push and ended up losing her three-month-old baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, someone recognized the woman in the video as Paisley Daniels&mdash;the heiress of the Daniels family and Martin Weiss's fianc&eacute;e.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">More people found out about Kyla Corbyn through the clues and dug out the old case that sent Kyla Corbyn to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All of a sudden, public opinion took Paisley Daniels's side. Many keyboard warriors called Kyla Corbyn evil and malicious for not even sparing an unborn baby. Some people threatened to give Kyla Corbyn a miserable death and typed out other various threats as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In her hospital bed, Paisley Daniels smiled as she read the comments on the trending news. Sure enough, she had become the perfect victim in the eyes of the public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Many people thought she had lost two children because of this. Martin Weiss would be wronging her if he still did not give her a title!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Someone even went to Weiss Group's official Twitter account, demanding Martin Weiss to marry her and then send Kyla Corbyn to prison again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mr. Daniels said firmly, "As long as the public opinion is on our side, the Weiss family won&rsquo;t dare to break off the engagement even if Martin finds out that you weren&rsquo;t the one who donated the bone marrow. The Weiss family can't afford to be humiliated. Besides, it's a fact that Kyla Corbyn has hurt you twice. Martin Weiss even testified as a witness himself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But... even if they're married, can Paisley can be happy?" Mrs. Daniels asked worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Paisley naturally has all the time in the world to seize Martin Weiss's heart after they're married. What is there to panic about? After all, the Weiss family and the Corbyn family are enemies. How sincere can Martin Weiss be to Kyla Corbyn?" said Mr. Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels also said confidently, "Mom, don't worry. I'll try my best to make Martin treat me fondly. Besides, Kyla Corbyn won't be alive for much longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As long as Kyla Corbyn died, then those past events would eventually be impossible to clarify!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels began to think of what to say when Martin Weiss came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, push notifications from several different applications suddenly popped up on her phone. All of them had the same words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">[Evidence of Paisley Daniels cheating is conclusive. The chairman of Weiss Group was cuckolded. Who's the real victim?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels was so shocked that she almost dropped the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She hurriedly opened one of the posts and read its contents. There was also a video that showed a busy street at noon. The area was surrounded by high-rise buildings and slabs of electronic screens that played commercials.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, the commercial playing on the electronic screen of one of the high-rise buildings stopped before changing to a candid video of&hellip; a couple having sex in a motel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels's face suddenly turned pale. She recognized it now. The couple in the video was clearly her and Shane Currey!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How did this happen? When was this video taken? And who took it?'</p></div>
