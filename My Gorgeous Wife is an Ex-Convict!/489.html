        <h1>Chapter 488</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;How do you think they should help? Are you expecting the Stevens family to go against Jason and become his enemy? Or do you expect the Stevens family to pump in billions to bring up our shares?&rdquo; Harold asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer immediately shut her mouth. She understood little regarding the business world. Once her husband said so, she understood that it was impossible to get help from the Stevens family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not just a matter of whether the Stevens family could bring out a few billion at one go. Just the fact that they would be going against Jason was impossible for them to do anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then... Then what should we do?&rdquo; Camelia Meyer was anxious. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with Jason that he&rsquo;s now bewitched by a woman like Grace? What drugs did that woman give him? She&rsquo;s just a woman that Sean did not want!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold impatiently chided, &ldquo;Enough! You can speak such things in front of me, but don&rsquo;t go around talking about it in public lest you want to attract more unnecessary troubles.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer was unwilling, but she could not say anything further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and meet up with Jason to see what his intentions are,&rdquo; Harold said. He could not allow the Atkinson family to be in a crisis because of a woman like Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Harold met Jason, he would not have imagined that Jason would give a peculiar offer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy if you want me to let you off. Within ten days, I want you to bulldoze the shopping mall that chased Grace out into a flat piece of land. Only then will I forget about this issue.&rdquo; Jason calmly offered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold could not believe what his ears heard. &ldquo;Flatten the shopping mall into a piece of land?&rdquo; That meant he was supposed to demolish the whole shopping mall? Notwithstanding the cost it took to build that mall, it was a mall within the city center that had a good sales record. The board of directors would not agree to demolish the mall just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Jason, I think there are some misunderstandings between us. If you want to vent your frustration on behalf of Ms. Cummins, why don&rsquo;t we discuss a different method of solving this?&rdquo; Harold tried to pave the way for a discussion to reduce his damages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there are any misunderstandings, but you have said one thing correctly. I am venting my frustration on her behalf. You should be glad that I didn&rsquo;t get someone to break off your wife&rsquo;s arm that hit her. I&rsquo;ve given you enough face for this.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold&rsquo;s expression became ugly. &ldquo;Jennifer was once your fianc&eacute;e back then. Can you just think of Jennifer and let this go for her sake? Or perhaps let me make amends personally toward Ms. Cummins?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold thought that he could use their past relationship to pull some sympathy, but Jason smirked. &ldquo;Think of Jennifer Atkinson?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if Harold had said the biggest joke of the century.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold panicked and felt that he had been reduced to shame by someone who was decades younger than himself. Out of reflex, he said, &ldquo;Now that you&rsquo;re with Grace, does she know what happened back then?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That sentence made the atmosphere&rsquo;s temperature drop abruptly. Jason coldly glared at Harold. It was a gaze that carried danger and death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Death?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold was shocked. Chills ran down his spine. It was as though if he were to say another word, he and all of the Atkinson family members would be bestowed with calamity!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Jason was indifferent toward what happened back then, that incident was now Jason&rsquo;s taboo!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Harold felt that everything he wanted to say was stuck in his throat, and he could not utter even half a word.</p></div>
