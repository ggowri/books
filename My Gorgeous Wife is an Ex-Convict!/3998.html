        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His footsteps paused. The three words "in this lifetime" were like a sharp pain in his nerves, causing a sudden pain in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also," Nancy paused, "I know that what I'm saying now, you may not believe anymore, and you may think it's a lie. But I still want to say thank you for getting justice for my mother. If one day you need me, even if it means risking my life, I will repay you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Repay me?" He snorted coldly, not even turning to look at her. "What ability do you have to repay me? What do I need you to do for me? In front of me, you're just a useless person!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Mick left without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy stood alone under the tree, her face full of bitterness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, even if she was willing to risk her life for him, he didn't need it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't even give him the slightest bit of repayment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At night, Mick didn't sleep. Instead, he went to the ancestral hall in the Reed family mansion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that ancestral hall, there was his grandfather's tablet and a picture of his grandfather hanging on the wall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew the story of his grandfather and grandmother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick's grandfather once left the Reed family because he loved his grandmother so much that he was willing to give up everything for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his grandmother couldn't bear the poverty of their life and left him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, Mick's grandfather passed away, and his grandmother has been repenting ever since. But Mick's father has never forgiven her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Big brother, why are you here so late?" Jasper's voice rang out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick turned around and looked at his sister. "Why are you here too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw you walking here from the window, so I followed to see what was going on," Jasper said. "Why did you come to the ancestral hall so late?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I couldn't sleep, so I came to take a look," Mick said, turning his gaze to the photo of his grandfather hanging above the ancestral hall. "Do you know why Grandpa chose to commit suicide after he found out that Grandma was using him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grandma chose Grandpa because he was the heir of the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Grandpa gave up his inheritance after his grandfather didn't allow Grandma to enter the Reed family, he lost his value to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grandma abandoned him so easily because he couldn't give her wealth and status.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you suddenly asking this?" Jasper asked strangely. Suddenly, as if he had thought of something, his face changed drastically. "Big brother, don't tell me you want to commit suicide too?! Nancy used you, but not all relationships are successful. Don't do anything stupid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick gave his sister a white look. Did he look like someone who couldn't handle it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just curious. That doesn't mean I would do something like that. Besides, a Nancy isn't worth me doing something like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper finally breathed a sigh of relief and looked up at the large photo. "Actually, Grandpa just loved Grandma too much and couldn't bear her leaving. I think he committed suicide not because he was being used, but because he was desperate after Grandma left him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Desperate? Mick pursed his lips. He didn't know what desperation felt like.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he had never experienced this feeling before.</span></p></div>
