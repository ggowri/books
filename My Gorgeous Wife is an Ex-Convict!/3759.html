        <h1>Chapter 3757</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you referring to...Vanessa?" Veronica asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The one who called me a gigolo and spread all sorts of rumors about you?" Mason asked, admitting that he hadn't bothered to remember the woman's name before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or rather, he usually didn't bother to remember women's names.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, that's her," Veronica confirmed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're aware that someone is intentionally making a big deal out of this," Mason stated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, how could the school demand that I drop out over these rumors? After all, I only rode in the car a few times, and there's no other substantial evidence," Veronica reasoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't stupid. In the office, the homeroom teacher had targeted her, and once she left the office, Veronica was subjected to cold ridicule and sarcasm from Vanessa, as if she had known the outcome all along. Of course, she could guess what was going on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they spoke, Veronica picked up a spoon and scooped up some soup to drink.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason suddenly grabbed her wrist, stopping her from putting the soup in her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong?" She looked at him in confusion, but saw him lean in slightly, blowing a few breaths onto the spoon in her hand before letting go and saying, "Don't drink it while it's too hot."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh." Veronica responded shyly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, she had always taken care of him more, but it seemed that after they got back together, he had taken on more of the responsibility of taking care of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's like he suddenly matured over the course of a few years, going from a naive teenager to someone more like a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in reality, he's only 18 years old, two years younger than her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing their meal, Veronica washed the dishes while Mason cleaned up the trash on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was no need to explain who did what, as if the two had already reached an understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everything was cleaned up, Mason washed his hands and said to Veronica, "Let me see your tongue."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You still want to see it?" She was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to see if it's better than before." He explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then slightly lifted her chin, parted her lips, and stuck out her tongue.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if to examine it more closely, he once again held her chin with his fingers, lifted it up, and leaned down to take a closer look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The distance between them became close once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't the first time he had seen her tongue, but this time it felt even closer than when they were in the car before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could feel his breath and count his eyelashes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His skin...still as good as ever. She remembered when they used to live together, she would always marvel at how smooth and poreless his skin was, even without any skincare products.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His facial features were already somewhat androgynous, but now he seemed to have more masculinity than before, with broader shoulders and a taller stature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, if he leaned in like this, he only needed to bend down slightly, but now the degree of bending was clearly greater.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyelids were half-closed, and his long black eyelashes trembled like a fan. Was he looking at her lips?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So what kind of person is she in his eyes now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Are they really going to start dating? From now on, are they officially boyfriend and girlfriend?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can familial love really turn into romantic love? And does his willingness to date her mean he can let go of the past?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you looking at?" His voice suddenly rang out.</span></p></div>
