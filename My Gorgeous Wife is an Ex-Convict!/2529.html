        <h1>Chapter 2527</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Gregory family and George Gregory!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would make them pay one day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what she should do now was leave before George Gregory found out that her blood had no effect on Simon!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With this in mind, Louise Mitchell got to work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next afternoon, Louise Mitchell headed to the airport with her luggage. She had bought a plane ticket to go abroad. She would be safe once she went abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if George Gregory discovered something, he could no longer threaten her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Louise Mitchell rushed to the airport, the doctor was telling George Gregory the result of Simon's exchange transfusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The effect of the transfusion isn't as good as we expected. It's not even as good as the last time. Logically speaking, your wife is Simon's biological mother, so this shouldn't happen," the doctor analyzed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's eyes narrowed. "It's not even as good as last time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, the effect is the same as the first regular transfusion, but the last one was better than these two times. We're going to do some more research to see what went wrong," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"More research? How long will that take?" George Gregory asked. Time was all that mattered to Simon now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was only worried that the child's condition would worsen with each passing day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll do it as soon as possible," the doctor said. After all, it was hard to guarantee anything in medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory pressed his thin lips together tightly. He knew things would not turn out the way he wanted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, George Gregory's phone rang suddenly. His subordinate&rsquo;s voice came from the phone. "Mr. Gregory, Mrs. Gregory has arrived at the airport with her luggage. It seems that she&rsquo;s about to board a plane and leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory froze. "She wants to leave Deer City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think so, and the terminal she's heading to is for international departures."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory could not help frowning. 'Louise Mitchell's leaving and going abroad? What the hell is she up to?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'And why is her blood useless on Simon? We can't let her leave no matter what.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Try to stop her. I'm coming over," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it, Mr. Gregory," the subordinate responded and hid nearby, planning to stop Louise Mitchell by surprise when she was ready to board the plane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the subordinate saw a police officer approach Louise Mitchell. They seemed to talk for a moment, then the police officer put a pair of handcuffs on Louise Mitchell's wrists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scene took the subordinate by surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did the police just... arrest Louise Mitchell? What the hell is going on here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell seemed to be panicking. Just now, the police said... she was suspected of being involved in Herman Moss's death. She was now a suspect, so she needed to return to the police station for questioning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's going on here? It was so many years ago. Why is it being brought up now?'</p></div>
