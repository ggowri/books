        <h1>Chapter 2247</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla had a fever afterward. She refused to take medicine for it at first, for fear of it affecting the baby, so she endured it. But her fever got worse and she almost died. If she kept refusing to take the medicine, the baby she was carrying would probably die with her. That was when she finally took medicine." Jacqueline Bowman continued, "You can see how much she loves the father of her child, Mr. Weiss. I&rsquo;m only telling you this with good intentions. I hope you'll take good care of Kyla. She has suffered so much. Even though she once loved the father of her eldest son so much, she's with you now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice paused, and the rest of her words seemed stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes stared blankly at Martin Weiss. The man whose face was full of indifference just now seemed to be overwhelmed with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pain seemed endless. It was as if the man was already in hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was shocked to see the pained look on Martin Weiss's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She never knew that a man could feel so much pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his pain was due to Kyla!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It made Jacqueline Bowman even more jealous! Who was Kyla to cause this man such pain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman only thought that Martin Weiss's pain at this moment was because he had found out how Kyla once loved another man so deeply, so she went to Martin Weiss's side. "Mr. Weiss, with a man like that in her heart, it must be hard for her to fall for anyone else, right? She loved that man more than her own life, or she wouldn't have tried so hard to give birth to the baby she was carrying. I was hoping you would be more considerate to Kyla, but... If her past relationship causes you so much pain, why should you continue it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman gently laid her hand on Martin Weiss's chest as she spoke. Seeing that Martin Weiss did not reject her, she felt joy. She immediately pressed herself closer to Martin Weiss's body. "Mr. Weiss, you're a qualified man. There's no need to make yourself so miserable. If you need anything, I'm willing to help you out, Mr. Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke amorously. The meaning of her words could easily spark the imagination of others. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss was immersed in his own thoughts. He seemed to have been crushed by what he had just learned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The overwhelming pain almost drowned him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out she had suffered so much back then. It turned out that such a short sentence had given her so much humiliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what had he done at the time? He was pretending to be lovey-dovey with Paisley Daniels. He thought he had gotten his revenge and protected the people he should be protecting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reality was that he did not even know who had saved his life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss kept feeling his heart contracting strongly. The pain hit him in waves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This must be what excruciating pain felt like!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why was he so stupid back then? His stupidity caused Kyla to pay such a painful price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman got closer to Martin Weiss, thinking now was her chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she took the advantage of Martin Weiss's pain and comforted him while flirting with him, she would become a source of this man&rsquo;s comfort. When that happened, so what if Kyla and Martin Weiss were already married? She could still become Mrs. Weiss. </p></div>
