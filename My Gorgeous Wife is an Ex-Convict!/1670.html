        <h1>Chapter 1668</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'That may be true, but...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She quickly found an excuse and said, "Eat... Eat first. You haven't even finished eating!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She seemed to have felt an electric current running through her body when he licked her fingertips earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," he replied obediently and put down her hands. He picked up the cutleries again and ate dinner. "Have your hands been hurting all these years?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"They&rsquo;re alright. It's still the same. They&rsquo;ll ache when the weather is cold and wet," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Would you like to see Dr. Russell again?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he uttered the words &lsquo;Dr. Russell&rsquo;, Grace instantly froze and looked at Jason in surprise. "Do you... remember Dr. Russell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason froze. Then as if he had come to his senses, his eyes glistened as he said, "Yes, I remember. I've recalled some of our past these days, so I remember Dr. Russell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you remember what happened back then?" Grace got excited. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I only remember some things, not many," he said lightly. It was in sharp contrast to her excitement. "Do you want me to remember what had happened back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Of course, I want you to..." She stopped halfway through her speech. 'Is it a good idea to have him recall the things in the past? How will he feel if he remembers how I had fallen into the sea and that the old master stabbed him in the back?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What will happen to his mental state?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">For a moment, Grace hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stared at Grace. "Hmm?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, I just want you to be happy whether or not you remember!" said Grace. She only hoped the old master would not become his lifelong sore point if he remembered everything one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If the old master had not plotted everything back then, they would not have lost five years with each other. Their third child would not be missing. At the very least, they would... know whether the child was alive or dead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's eyes darkened as she thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason murmured, "I'm happy right now. What about you? Do you wish you could remember why you left the Reed family and me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She froze but immediately said, "There's nothing to wish for. The memory doesn't matter anymore. It's good enough that I'm back, isn't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, it's good enough that you're back." He smiled gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... it might be good enough for her, but it was not nearly good enough for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He wanted to find out the truth and the real reason she left him back then. Maybe he could be at ease when he found out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Otherwise, he would never feel at ease!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That night, after the two children had gone to bed, Grace went back to her bedroom and found Jason sitting on the couch. He was flipping through some documents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She said, "Jay, I want to talk to you about something."</p></div>
