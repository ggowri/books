        <h1>Chapter 1188</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go. The doctor will be here soon, and it'll be troublesome to go get him again if you've gone away and aren't around." After all, doctors were not always in their offices. Sometimes, they had to make ward rounds or go to the outpatient clinic. They were not always available.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn thought about it and agreed, so she said to Chase Harper, "Sorry for the trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing. I came over to run errands!" Chase Harper said with a smile. Then he turned and walked out of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at Chase Harper's leaving figure and could not help saying with a sigh, "He's a nice man."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, he's a nice man," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But this world is always unfair to kind people. I hope good things happen to him," muttered Kyla Corbyn. When she was young, she had not thought much of dull and honest men like Chase Harper. At that time, the men she admired were men like Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after experiencing so many things, she found that it was a blessing to fall for an honest man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One did not have to worry about betrayal, cheating, or even revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Life would be peaceful. Though they did not have much money and life was hard, their heart would be calm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several people stayed in the ward until the doctor came and gave the summary report to Kyla Corbyn. Chase Harper still had not come back when the doctor left after giving his advice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was taking... a little long!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt a little uneasy for some reason, but then she laughed at herself for overthinking it. Maybe Chase Harper was just unfamiliar with the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She called Chase Harper, but there was no answer on the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help frowning. "What's wrong? Chase Harper isn&rsquo;t answering the phone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe he didn't hear his phone ring. I'll call him again later," said Grace. Just as she was speaking, a nurse rushed into the ward and said to Grace, "The man who came with you today is a friend of yours, right? The police are coming to take him to the police station for interrogation. He may be detained if things go wrong. You should see if you can make peace with the other party."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. She and Kyla Corbyn looked at each other and saw the surprise in each other's eyes. "Detain? What's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse glanced at the children in the pediatric ward, biting back her words. Grace understood and hurried outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse then said, "It&rsquo;s a charge for sexual harassment and attempted rape. There were witnesses, so the police are taking the man to the police station."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. A charge for attempted rape seemed to have nothing to do with Chase Harper. Could a person like him do such a thing? He was at the hospital, helping to get copies of reports.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It just did not make sense!</p></div>
