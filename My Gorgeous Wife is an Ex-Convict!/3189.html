        <h1>Chapter 3187</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As more and more people gathered around, Valda quickly said, "Brian, you should let go first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She wants to hurt you," Brian said coldly. Just hearing this was enough to drive him crazy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But she hasn't hurt me yet, right?" Valda said. "Besides, I think she's the one who's hurt more now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she raised her hand and grabbed the hand of Brian, who was holding Lexi's wrist. "Okay, she's learned her lesson this time and probably won't dare to do anything to me again. But if she does come after me again, I won't stop you from dealing with her however you see fit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's fingers finally loosened and he turned to look at Valda. The cold expression on his face was replaced with a worried look. "Are you really okay?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm fine," Valda shook her head. "She just threw my phone on the ground, she didn't hit me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian pursed his lips and glanced at the phone on the ground. He took a few steps, picked up the phone, and then held Valda's hand. "Let's go, the food is almost ready."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Brian stopped again and looked at Lexi, who was still holding her wrist with a painful expression on her face. "If you do this again, even your parents won't be able to protect you in the future. My bottom line is not something you can challenge!" he warned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi's face turned even paler. Brian's words were undoubtedly a public humiliation for her, especially in front of her classmates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In school, she had always been known as Brian's cousin and had a good relationship with the Hart family. She was also very popular with her cousin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, her image in school had completely collapsed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi's lips trembled and she wanted to say something, but nothing came out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian had already left with Valda, holding her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lexi's classmates looked at each other in confusion. Although they didn't say anything, their expressions towards Lexi had already changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda and Brian returned to their private room. Valda checked her phone to see if it was damaged from the fall. After confirming that her phone was okay, she breathed a sigh of relief. As she looked up, she met the gaze of those deep phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened exactly? What did Lexi say or do to you?" he asked, his eyes flashing with a cold anger that showed he was still not over what Lexi had done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda didn't hide anything and directly explained what happened when she met Lexi Lambert in the bathroom, what Lexi said, and briefly mentioned the reason for the conflict.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After listening, Brian furrowed his brows slightly and said, "It seems like she really thinks too highly of herself." In the future, he will have to give the Lambert family a bit of a reality check and make them understand some important principles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I'm fine. After what happened today, she should be scared too," said Valda, changing the subject. "I'm hungry, we should eat some vegetables quickly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While speaking, she lowered her head and started working.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her eating with gentle eyes and said, "But it was good that you called me when something happened today." If he hadn't received that call, would Lexi have really ended up calling Valda?</p></div>
