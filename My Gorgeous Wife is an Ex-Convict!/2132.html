        <h1>Chapter 2130</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It did not matter to her, but Kyla was pregnant. It was bad for her to starve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "I was too nervous to feel hungry myself. But fortunately, Lina and the baby are safe now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, they're safe now," Grace said with relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The four of them arrived at a restaurant near the hospital. Grace and Kyla ordered while Jason said a few words. Only Martin Weiss was silent from the beginning, and the expression on his face was icy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Grace and Kyla went to the bathroom after ordering the food, Grace asked, "What's the matter? Did you quarrel with Martin Weiss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why does Martin Weiss's expression look so grim? He looks like it's the end of the world," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He's always serious. Just ignore him," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason and Martin Weiss were also chatting in the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Are you worried about Kyla after seeing Lina's difficult labor?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's expression changed slightly. The person in front of him had sharp eyes. It was as if he could see right through people. "Hadwin Stephenson was probably well-prepared, but something like this still happened. If it hadn't been for that little boy, would there have been two deaths today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, it's all thanks to that little boy. That's why money isn't everything sometimes. Women walk into the jaws of death when they deliver a baby," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, he went straight to the hospital and got a vasectomy after Grace returned to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though doctors said the chances of Grace conceiving again were slim, he did not want to bet on that one-in-a-million chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Walk into the jaws of death..." murmured Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, Grace and Kyla returned. The dishes were soon served.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The four of them began eating dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After the meal, the four went back to the hospital again, but Lina was still in a coma and had not woken up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">New babies were monitored in the neonatal care unit. They would be sent back to the ward if nothing happened in 24 hours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at Grace and said, "Thank you for bringing the child over today. If it hadn't been for the child, then..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The child appeared outside the delivery room himself, saying he could save Lina. I had no other choice but to try everything I could. Luckily, it turned out alright in the end," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really?" Doubt flashed across Hadwin Stephenson's face. "Lina mentioned a little boy looking at her belly and saying she&rsquo;s having a girl before this. Is it the same child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, " Yes, he's the one. I have a feeling that he's no ordinary child. Or maybe he and Lina are fated?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After chatting for a while, Hadwin Stephenson said, "Thank you. I have no idea when will Lina wake up, so I&rsquo;ll stay the night. Why don't you go home and have a good rest?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, let us know if you need anything," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The four walked out of the hospital ward. Grace looked at Kyla and said, "Kyla, are you going home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, you don't have to take me home. I'll&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Martin Weiss interrupted Kyla before she could finish speaking. "I'll take her home."</p></div>
