        <h1>Chapter 2893</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you were imprisoned in a cage, would you like the cage and refuse to leave?" she retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her with a steady gaze, his thin lips pursed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian Hart, there is no point in keeping me locked up in this villa. No one knows if there is a child or not, but one thing is clear: it's already past the time to take birth control pills, and I couldn't have secretly taken them without you knowing. If you're afraid that I'll have an abortion without telling you if I get pregnant, then you don't have to worry. I will give birth to the child, so I hope you can agree to my request: the custody of the child belongs to me, and you won't come to fight for it. The child will live with me, and if the child wants to live with you in the future, then that's fine too. I will respect the child's choice. During the time we live together, you and your family can come to visit the child, and I won't stop you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart listened to Valda Theller's long speech. "You've said so much, thought so much, but you haven't thought about living together with the child and raising it together, have you?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're not suitable for marriage, and I don't want our mutual affection to be wasted on jealousy and quarrels after marriage," she said, tightening her grip on the chopsticks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wouldn't know how much courage it took for her to say these things about her thoughts and plans for the future child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wouldn't know how much confusion and fear she had when she thought about raising a child alone in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days, she had been thinking repeatedly about what was the best choice for the future. Although marrying him would seem better to outsiders than raising a child alone, she was too afraid of being with him day and night. Her love for him would only grow deeper, and the deeper it grew, the easier it would be for her to lose herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So she wanted to escape, no matter what, she wanted to escape from him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you really want to leave here, you can!" Brian Hart's voice rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at him in surprise. "Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just that I hope you can accompany me to a place," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where?" she asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And when Valda Theller followed Brian Hart to their destination, she was a little stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was an old amusement park in Emerald City, with a history of thirty or forty years. Most of the equipment inside was also quite old, but because the prices were cheap, only 2 or 3 yuan for a ride, compared to the popular large-scale amusement parks nowadays, where a ride could cost tens of yuan, it was much better, so there were still many families who brought their children here to play.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller had been here when she was a child. At that time, the amusement park in Emerald City was not as big as it is now, and the amusement facilities here were considered good at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't want me to accompany you to play here, do you?" Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, just a walk," Brian Hart said. "We're not suitable for riding those facilities anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he took her hand and walked towards the amusement park.</p></div>
