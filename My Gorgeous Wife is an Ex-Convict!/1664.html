        <h1>Chapter 1662</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's colleagues had suddenly taken her side, and even their tone when they spoke was faintly obsequious!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Some colleagues began sounding out Lina about her relationship with Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, have you gotten back together with Hadwin Stephenson?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He looked so cool when he took you away from the reporters the other day. He looked just like Prince Charming who saved the princess in fairy tales."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, are you going to be the president's wife?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina knew the change in her colleagues' attitude was all because of Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Society was so realistic sometimes! She had experienced it so much over the past five years that she could care less about it now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Stephenson and I have nothing to do with each other, so please stop making wild guesses. I'm seeing someone else. You'll cause me trouble by saying that," Lina said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The colleagues instantly looked awkward upon hearing what she said. They looked at each other and quickly dispersed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina finally had some peace to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson did not show up when she went home yesterday, and Hadwin Stephenson's staff had also told her, "Mr. Stephenson said it should be over now. You needn't worry anymore, and your life will return to normal&mdash;just like before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Just like before... Does that mean he won't show up in front of me anymore?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's nose suddenly felt a little sore when she thought of this. She felt that her eyes were a little warm as well. Then, she told herself, 'It's what I want. What's there to be sad about?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was for the best that she separated from Hadwin Stephenson under these circumstances. There was no hate and resentment. What they had would mostly be fond memories of each other!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was better than the two of them getting back together, separating again in the future, and then becoming enemies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson kept saying he still loved her, but... she dared not be with him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was already 33, not 22.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe sometimes the older she got, the timider she became!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was relieved to learn that Lina had returned to her home and her life was peaceful now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's life was finally back on track, so she said, "Let's ask Kyla out and have a nice time together when we're free. We haven't gotten together since I came back to Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Sure! It's time we three got together," replied Lina. Then, she said emotionally, "It feels like time flies. It's been almost five years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, time really flies," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Many things had changed in five years, but some things would never change no matter how long it took!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After ending her phone call with Lina, Grace asked the driver to drive her to an office building on the west side of town. She was going to open a law firm and had begun looking for a place these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As she was about to walk into the office building, something suddenly fell from above.</p></div>
