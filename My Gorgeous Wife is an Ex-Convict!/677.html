        <h1>Chapter 676</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace suddenly opened her eyes, she realized that she had been dreaming again. She dreamed about the little boy and the little girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She woke up after dreaming about the little boy falling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she looked up, her almond-shaped eyes met a pair of familiar peach blossom eyes. However, at the moment, Jason's eyes were like a deep, dark, bottomless sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Had a dream?" he asked with his thin lips parted, his voice sounding so far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Grace nodded and looked at the clock on the wall. It was past two o 'clock in the morning. "Did I wake you up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I just happen to have some trouble sleeping. What were you dreaming about? You look so pale," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace opened her mouth, but for a moment, she did not know what to say. Could she say she dreamt about a little girl saving a little boy and that she thought the little boy could be Brian?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was already sensitive about Brian mistaking her for someone else, and now she could not even figure out why she had such a dream. Was it really because her cousin had told her how she saved Brian when they were little? Therefore... Was that why she had such a dream?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, why did the little girl in the dream seem to be herself?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing." Grace shook her head gently and said, "It was just an unimportant dream."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Unimportant?' Jason's eyelashes quivered a little. "You have a lot of sweat on your forehead," he said, raising his hand to her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then noticed that her forehead felt wet. Her palms and back were all covered with sweat too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next moment, she noticed that his hand had stopped at her forehead. He did not go any further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. "What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason turned pale. He pulled back his fingers with difficulty, trying to withdraw his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She seized his hand immediately and felt it tremble. "Why are your hands shaking?" she asked, seeing at once that it was not only his hands that were shaking but his whole body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter, Jay? Why are you shaking so much?" asked Grace hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was a little out of breath. "I'm fine. I should be all right in a minute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll call the driver and take you to the hospital!" Grace said worriedly. She picked up her phone and planned to call the driver who lived in Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she made the call, he had already hugged her from behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hands were wrapped tightly around her, and his face was buried deep in her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hot breath sprayed down her neck. Each breath was so heavy that she could feel the weight on her shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, why don&rsquo;t you let go first? I'll take you to the hospital with the driver so that..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm really fine. There's no need to go to the hospital. Just let me... Hold you like this," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked puzzled but did what he said and stayed still while he hugged her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His arms around her were getting tighter and tighter, trembling in a way that made her feel the pain of being held to her bones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sssss!" she gasped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stiffened, and his hoarse, apologetic voice rang in her ear, "I'm sorry I hurt you. Just bear with me a little bit longer, all right? Let me hold you a little longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if holding her and making sure she was by his side was the only way to ease him out of his panic.</p></div>
