        <h1>Chapter 820</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took her hand calmly and gently before saying, "Yes, I am. I can be the sword in your hand even if the person you're dealing with is Jason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could make an enemy of anyone for her as long as that was her wish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was because... he was so in love with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, he loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he had never really told her about this deep love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was angry with her, hated her, and resented her, but in the end, he found that all these feelings were no match for his love for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During their three years apart, he thought he hated her, but at the end of the day, he was still in love with her. He thought about her every day. Gradually, this love unconsciously became deeper and deeper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, I&rsquo;ll be your sword," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Lina&rsquo;s heart was beating violently!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes and his voice was like an invisible net catching her firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was woken up the next day by her phone alarm. She was still a little dizzy, and there was a note by her bedside from Lina, letting her know that it was Lina who sent her home the night before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides the note, there was a new set of clothes and a new pair of shoes on the nightstand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Lina's gift to her as she had gotten a new job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at these things, Grace's eyes slightly warmed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace still had a dull headache from the drinking, so after a quick washing up, she got straight on the bus without buying breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the bus moved slowly down the road, the memories of last night came back to her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She vaguely remembered that after coming out of Drunken Days last night, she seemed to have... bumped into Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after that... her memory was a little fuzzy. She seemed to have said a lot of things to him, but she could not remember anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace rubbed her forehead that was in pain. She had already said those words anyway. It was useless for her to think about this now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She met him yesterday by chance, but she probably would not have another chance to meet him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt another pang in her heart as she thought of when he had helped her to stop the drunk man in Drunken Days yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that even after their breakup, she still relied on him to help her out of trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... no more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I have to rely on my own from now on!' she thought to herself silently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she arrived at the office, some colleagues were already there. Those who had gathered together to chat with each other stopped as soon as she came in. They looked at her in unison. There were curiosity and inquisition, but also disdain and contempt in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was quite used to all sorts of strange looks from people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She put down her bag, turned on her computer, and headed to the pantry to get herself a glass of water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a female colleague who had dinner with Grace yesterday came up to her curiously and asked, "Grace, are you... really Jason's girlfriend? Did Jason help foot the bill yesterday?"</p></div>
