        <h1>Chapter 350</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All right! All confirmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina stepped forward and said, "Are you Mr. Motley, Carl Motley? Hello, I'm Lina."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello," he replied as he looked her over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I wanted to tell you that I..." Lina wanted to apologize to him. After all, she went on the blind date today without really meaning it. She just wanted to deal with her mother. She could treat him to dinner later and just become friends with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish her sentence, he interrupted her. "Why don't we take a walk? I saw a small park next to the supermarket. Why don't we go there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Huh? The park?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina glanced at the already darkened sky and looked at the time. It was already past five o 'clock in the afternoon, and it was almost time for dinner. "Don't you want to eat first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her remark was a well-meaning reminder. This was a crowded place after all. By dinner time, people would have to queue for a lot of restaurants around here. If they went for dinner after taking a walk in the park, they would be just in time for rush hour. By then, they would have to queue for quite some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not hungry yet. Let's talk first," said Carl Motley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina followed him to the small park. Then came what Lina thought was a stormy bombardment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His questions were almost all-encompassing. It included everything from her age, family, occupation, and education, which was followed by her university, high school, junior high school, primary school, and so on. Finally, he even asked for her grades in primary school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina could not help but sigh. 'Do they ask so much on blind dates nowadays?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you ever been in a relationship, Miss Sweeney?" Carl Motley asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well. Excuse me, Mr. Motley, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish, Carl Motley went on saying, "I don't like my girlfriend to have had too many boyfriends before, Miss Sweeney. I also don't want her to have a lot of experience in that field, so I hope you can be honest with me. That way we can avoid any misunderstandings in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was dumbfounded. This&hellip; This guy was a little too straightforward. They had just met for the first time. Even if she did not know much about blind dates, at least she knew this was not the right question to ask now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A lot of experience in that field... Uh, what field was that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I think we've got a bit of a misunderstanding here..." Lina felt that even if she was planning to find a partner through blind dates, she would never feel anything for Mr. Motley who was now right in front of her. They obviously were not on the same page when it came to personal values.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a voice suddenly rang, interrupting what she was going to say next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well then, I'd like to hear what&rsquo;s the misunderstanding between you and this gentleman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina shivered immediately. It was... Hadwin!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned around instantly. Sure enough, a familiar figure caught her eye. His face was so beautiful that she, someone who was appearance-obsessed, could not help but notice him. Who else would it be if not Hadwin?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why... Why are you here?" Lina said dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you choose to be here with another man because you thought I wouldn't be here?" Hadwin asked rhetorically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina felt as if there was a burst of thunder hitting her forehead. It hurt badly. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She rarely went on blind dates, and the one time she did, she was caught by Hadwin. Was God trying to kill her?</p></div>
