        <h1>Chapter 2266</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. They knew she was a store owner, which meant... It was not a coincidence that they stole the car. She happened to fall asleep in the car, which led to things turning out this way. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was likely that... she was their target from the beginning!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they were going to kidnap her in the first place, did they already know she was in the car? However, that car belonged to Jacqueline Bowman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of Jacqueline Bowman inviting her to pray at the temple, the amulet she gave, its fragrance, and her falling asleep... Kyla could almost figure out what had happened!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough. We've gone too long without a woman, so you're our only choice today!" As he finished speaking, his hands tore her clothes apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's heart sank. She knew she would have a hard time dodging this today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just wanted the baby in her belly to be safe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to protect her baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she could do now was obey and look for opportunities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would likely hurt the baby in her belly if she struggled aggressively!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Kyla gave up the struggle, the sound of the door being knocked down rang out suddenly. Then, it was followed by a panicked commotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who? Who is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hurry and run! Grab that b*tch!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Boss, what should we do? Police... Police cars have surrounded us downstairs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" The deep voice shocked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not the voice of the two young men. It was deeper and... slightly familiar. She must have heard it before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who is it? Whose voice is it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Mr. Lambert's face flashed across Kyla's mind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, another doubt arose in Kyla's mind. When Grace stood up for her and said in front of Mr. Lambert that she was the triplets' godmother, Mr. Lambert should know that she was close to the Reed family. Why did the two young men know nothing about it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea that Mr. Lambert thought Grace only stood up for her and said Kyla was the triplets' godmother to do Martin Weiss a favor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Combined with Jacqueline Bowman's several attempts of understating Kyla&rsquo;s relationship with the Reed family, Mr. Lambert really did not think much of it. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no way Mr. Lambert would tell this to the two thugs he hired as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the two young men had no idea about Kyla's relationship with the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police who broke in immediately surrounded them. "Freeze! You're surrounded!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next moment, Kyla only felt someone yanking her. A cold object was pressed against her neck. Then, she felt a pain in her neck as though someone was cutting her flesh!</p></div>
