        <h1>Chapter 834</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No! No way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll take Grace's place completely one day. I'll be the one to stand beside him and have the last laugh!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the bus and went back to her rental house. Her legs were so sore that she could hardly lift them. She took out two band-aids from her first aid kit and applied them on her knees.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She breathed a sigh of relief when she felt the heat in her knee and the easing pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tonight had been like a battle for her. She was exhausted, and her back was covered with a layer of cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that even if it was already summer, her joints could not endure the cold air-conditioning for too long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The encounter with Brian and Stella this evening was a surprise. When Brian grabbed her by the arm and asked about Jason right before she left, she felt a pang in her heart again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If it was back in the old days, Jay would probably have accompanied me if I was going to a place like a nightclub.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row would not have the guts to keep her standing for so long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If my knee was hurting, Jay would hold me carefully and rub my knee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's just that... All of this no longer exists!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sweeter and intimate they once were, the more it set off the cruelty now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'My Jay is gone!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought she was done with the nightclub incident. However, the next day after work, she saw Brian waiting at the door of her rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately stopped, surprise flashing in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you live here now?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," she replied, wondering why Brian was here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Since Brian knew that this was where she lived now, he must have checked some basic information about her current situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm curious to know why you&rsquo;d rent a house in a place like this. Don't you live at Reed Residence? Why would Jason let you live here?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he told himself not to bother about her, he had her checked out anyway after the nightclub incident last night. It was then he found out that she was working as an assistant at a law firm and was living in such an area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This seemed inconceivable to him. 'If she insisted on being a mere assistant in the law firm, then why would Jason allow her to move out of Reed Residence to live in such a place?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could see Jason's concern for her. Jason could even go against the Hart family for her. Otherwise, how could he have let her go again and again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... This was completely beyond his expectation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of asking Jason, he came to her instead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why?' Brian's phoenix eyes were fixed on Grace's comely face. He always thought that this was how the little girl he had been looking for would grow up to look like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did I come here only to see her one more time?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian laughed. He had no feelings for her anymore. He came just because he was curious and wanted to find out the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip and met Brian's eye. "I broke up with Jason, so now I live here. What's so weird about that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Broke up?" Brian was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Very few things surprised him, but now he was shocked!</p></div>
