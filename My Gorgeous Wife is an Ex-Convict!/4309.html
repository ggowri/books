        <h1>Chapter 4307 Conditions of the Quentin Family</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley contacted Lornell. "Lornell, is Chandler currently in the Quentin family? Tina wants to go find Chandler."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you still not know the rules of the Quentin family? It's not something anyone can enter," Lornell's cold voice came from the other end of the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley shrank back. "I know, so Tina wants to meet you first. Can you meet her?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a moment of silence on the other end of the phone before Lornell said, "Alright, tomorrow then. I'll send you the address later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Harley breathed a sigh of relief. She was really afraid that he would refuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he wasn't someone who enjoyed socializing, and his relationship with Tina used to be average. His relationship with Chandler was a good one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Chandler and Tina separated, Lornell's attitude towards Tina naturally became average as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley said to Tina, "Tina and Lornell agreed to meet tomorrow. I'll go with you then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you!" Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Harley took Tina to the meeting place agreed upon with Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a high-end club, and Lornell was already waiting for Tina in a private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This club belongs to the Quentin family, so what we say here shouldn't be heard outside," Lornell looked at Tina and said, "Of course, today I'm meeting you because of Chandler!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to go to the Quentin family to find Chandler," Tina said directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Only those who have something that the Quentin family wants can enter the Quentin family. Do you have something that would interest them?" Lornell looked at Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina said, "The Stephenson family's assets. If there's anything that interests the Quentin family, I can bring it up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already discussed this with her parents before meeting Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father had said, "If all the Quentin family wants is money, then the Stephenson family can provide it. It doesn't matter how much. But if they want something else, then it's difficult. We may not be able to obtain what the Quentin family likes in a short period."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With the phrase "it doesn't matter how much," Tina understood that her father was willing to sacrifice for her. The Stephenson family's assets were built by her father's hard work.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he was willing to give them away without counting the cost, all for her sake!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Tina's words didn't seem to elicit any reaction from Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Quentin family never wants money. If they wanted money, they could easily obtain it," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina fell silent. Indeed, the Quentin family had excellent medical skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter how wealthy someone was, they would still be tormented by illness and would seek help from the Quentin family. The Quentin family naturally didn't lack money.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lornell, can't you make an exception?" Harley couldn't help but plead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell raised his eyes and looked at Harley with a smile that wasn't really a smile. "You want me to make an exception?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was taken aback. At this moment, his expression seemed as if he thought she had just said a joke as if he was asking her why he should make an exception.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's eyes dimmed. Yeah, why should she? Did she really think that her plea would have any effect?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wasn't someone he liked to begin with, so naturally, she didn't hold much significance in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Tina spoke up, "Harley, could you please step aside for a moment? I would like to have a private conversation with Mr. Quentin."</span></p></div>
