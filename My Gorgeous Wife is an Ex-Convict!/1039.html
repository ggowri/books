        <h1>Chapter 1038</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You and Dr. Russell seem to know each other very well," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was surprising that someone like Brian would know an old doctor from a small clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We've known each other for years. I broke my leg when your cousin and I got down from the hill in town. Many doctors said there could be side effects even if it healed. My mother heard about Dr. Russell and brought me to him for treatment," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was startled. "You broke your leg?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. It took me three months to walk," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It turns out he had suffered such an injury. Did he injure himself when he fell off the cliff?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought to herself. She remembered that after she had pulled him up from the cliff, he seemed unable to walk. She had been muttering about how spoiled he was, but it was because of a broken leg.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... he never said anything about his leg hurting. He just kept apologizing for dragging her down when she carried him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Back then... did your leg hurt a lot?" she could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glanced at her as he drove. "Am I supposed to take this as a sign that you care?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pursed her lips and kept quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ignoring her silence, he continued saying, "It hurt. I thought it was the worst pain of my life, but then..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then what?" she asked subconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing," he said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Then I realized that failing to find the little girl was an even greater pain for me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like he had lost something important! It was as if he would regret it forever if he could not find her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now that he found Stella, he only regretted that she was far from what he expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was probably better to miss than to meet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They soon arrived at Dr. Russell's small clinic. Grace and Brian got out of the car and walked into the clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell was all set. He took Grace to one of the treatment rooms and said to her, "I'm going to work on correcting your fingers. The process is going to be a little painful. However, we can't use any anesthetic because once we use anesthetic, your fingers will lose feeling and I won't be able to determine how much strength I should use to correct them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, no problem." Grace nodded and looked at Dr. Russell's array of tools that included a variety of needle knives. It made her scalp tingle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell took another look at Brian who was standing beside him. "What's the matter? Are you going to stand here and watch?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." Before Brian could speak, Grace said, "Mr. Hart, do you mind going out for a moment?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pursed his thin lips slightly. "Alright, I'll wait outside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian closed the door once he was out of the treatment room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Mr. Hart... I'm still Mr. Hart&hellip;' Brian could not help smiling wryly. Even though he had been trying to get close to her, she still kept her distance from him.</p></div>
