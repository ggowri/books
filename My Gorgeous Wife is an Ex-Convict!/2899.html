        <h1>Chapter 2897</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "Valda Theller, I know my family has wronged you, but please spare them for the sake of your uncle and cousin who are related to you by blood. They are now in police custody. Please ask the police to release them. We won't ask you for money again in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took a few steps back and looked coldly at the person in front of her. "I don't run the police station. I can't just ask them to release people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you can ask Mr. Hart!" Rowena Santiago said. "With Mr. Hart's ability, he can definitely get the police to release them immediately. Besides...if it weren't for Mr. Hart, they wouldn't have been arrested by the police. Now the police are going to prosecute them. If your cousin really goes to jail, his life will be ruined! Valda Theller, are you going to watch your cousin's life be ruined?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When my cousin caused trouble at the convention, did you ever think that my life might also be ruined? You just stood by and watched," Valda Theller replied indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Rowena Santiago was crying miserably, Valda Theller had no sympathy for her. Her last bit of family affection had been completely erased during the convention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want from me? I have already apologized to you and even knelt down. Are you still not willing to spare your uncle and cousin?" Rowena Santiago was clearly dissatisfied with Valda Theller's attitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had always been arrogant in front of Valda Theller. If it weren't for her husband and son being detained, she wouldn't have come to beg Valda Theller like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In her opinion, Valda Theller should have agreed to spare them after she had done all this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't ask you to apologize to me, let alone kneel down," Valda Theller said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Rowena Santiago's face changed. The look of hesitation and sorrow on her face turned into anger, and she stood up suddenly. "Valda Theller, you're just using Brian Hart as your backer. If your cousin is really sentenced, I won't live anymore. I'll tell everyone that you're the one who killed me. I doubt you'll have any face left then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took a deep breath. "If you want to die, I won't stop you. As for whether I have any face left, that's my business. You can watch carefully from underground when the time comes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago was speechless after being told this. Her niece was now unyielding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you don't leave now, I'll call the security guards in the building, or even call the police. I think you'll be more embarrassed than me then," Valda Theller said.</p></div>
