        <h1>Chapter 989</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she knew he was powerful and his ability was far better than hers, she still wanted to protect him with all her might.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he was insecure, then she would give her everything to make him feel secure, to love him, and to let him understand how important he was to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what happened afterward let her understand that all the things she did for him were just a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never needed her to protect him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was just a pawn to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled wryly before bending over to take off Jason's shoes. She planned to tuck him in before sleeping in the chair for the rest of the night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the bed was against one side of the wall and the sheets were against the wall, she needed to get over him to pull the sheets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had just pulled a corner of the sheets and was about to tuck Jason in when she noticed that he had somehow opened his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he was drunk, those dark eyes seemed to glisten and exude endless seduction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace..." His thin lips parted, and her name escaped his mouth softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately froze, and before she knew it, his hands were around her waist. He had pulled her into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Caught off guard, Grace lay on top of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her instinct was to get up and free herself from his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his hands seemed to cling to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, don't... fall in love with Brian... alright?" His hoarse voice, mixed with the strong smell of alcohol, wafted through the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't fall in love with Brian nor anyone. Are you happy with that answer? Let go, and I'll tuck you in," she said, wanting to get out of his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... won't fall in love with anyone?" he repeated her words, and the next moment, he rolled over on top of Grace. "You won't love me either?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought the pose was more ambiguous than before and... more difficult to break free from.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Half his weight was on her. The smell of liquor and his faint cologne rushed toward her nostrils.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We&rsquo;ve broken up. You said you don't want to love me anymore. Do you expect me to love you?" Grace only found his remark somewhat amusing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He probably only said such words because he was drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're drunk. Let me get up," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure... you don't love me anymore?" he muttered in a whisper. The intoxicated look in his eyes seemed to be gradually stained with pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She thought she was seeing it wrong. 'Pain? Why would he suffer when he's the one who broke up with me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'm sure," she answered him calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the hurt in his eyes was so strong that Grace could no longer tell herself that she was seeing it wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could clearly see that the hurt in his eyes was so overwhelming, as if he had lost something that mattered to him most.</p></div>
