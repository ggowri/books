        <h1>Chapter 3889</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, there's no need to get a pillow with my face on it. If you want to hug something, just hug me. If I'm not by your side, just call me and I'll come to you," Mason said seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's expression became one of mixed amusement and exasperation. "I want a pillow with your face on it, not some celebrity's face. You're not allowed to forbid that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm petty like that," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She rolled her eyes. Okay, she gets it now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In any case, Veronica's idea of putting Mason's face on a pillow was extinguished while it was still a small flame.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Veronica continued to choose photos from their wedding album like a good girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, out of nowhere, Mason said, "Have you ever hugged a pillow with a celebrity's face on it before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The tone of his voice made it seem like there was some kind of danger lurking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica shuddered and looked at Mason with a speechless expression. "No, I haven't," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, don't start now," he reminded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." He really was as stingy as he said he was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wedding was being prepared in an orderly manner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although they were a bit pressed for time, it wasn't a big problem for the Reed family. The media had already dubbed this wedding as the wedding of the century in Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And just the leaked portion of the guest list that the Reed family wanted to invite was enough to make people's jaws drop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They were all big shots in Emerald City, from wealthy families and aristocrats!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were even some important figures from the academic and judicial circles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was said that some popular stars wanted to attend the wedding, but they couldn't even get an invitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a while, being able to get an invitation to this wedding became a symbol of status.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other hand, because Veronica had previously announced at a press conference that she had cut ties with her biological family, some people were speculating whether she would invite them to the wedding as the bride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some media went to interview Veronica's father, Archer, and her stepmother, Rosalind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Facing the camera, Archer confidently stated that the issues between him and his daughter were just misunderstandings, and he believed that she would come around. As parents, they should naturally attend their daughter's wedding, even if it meant meeting her biological mother who had passed away, just to see their daughter in a wedding dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as this interview was posted online, it immediately sparked a heated discussion among the public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica understood very well that her father and stepmother were trying to use the media to attend her wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as they could get into the wedding, they could use her status as the Reed family's daughter-in-law to gain more benefits in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this matter, Veronica was the one in charge on the Reed family's side, and she had made it clear to them that she would not invite anyone from the Barlow family to her wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Archer found out that his daughter really didn't want them to attend the wedding, he sat in front of the media and cried out, expressing his desire to meet his daughter and get some clarity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer also bluntly stated that his daughter was too fond of wealth and despised her own family, and that there would be a day when she would suffer losses and be looked down upon by others.</p></div>
