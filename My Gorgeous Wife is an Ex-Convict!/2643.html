        <h1>Chapter 2641</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello," Grace and Lina said hurriedly, but their eyes were full of surprise. Especially Grace. 'Did Brian just say... she's his girlfriend?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian has a girlfriend?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you two seeing each other?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, but we haven't been seeing each other for long," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect to fall for Valda, but love is unexpected sometimes," said Brian. Valda Theller could feel the fingers holding her clenching as if he was telling her to cooperate with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted her to act in front of these two women and convince them she was his girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was the one who hurt him romantically one of these women? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the two seriously. "Are you really seeing each other?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Could it be fake?" Brian grabbed Valda Theller's hand and pressed it on his heart. "Grace, I think Valda might be the only one who can save me now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze, while Valda Theller asked in a panic, "What's wrong? Are you sick? Is it serious?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her worried expression was not fake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the only one among the four people present who did not understand the meaning of the word &lsquo;save&rsquo; when it came out of Brian&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "I'm not sick. I'm in good health. I'm just saying you&rsquo;ll save me if I'm in danger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was relieved. "So, that's what you mean. Of course, I'll save you if you're in danger. You're my boyfriend, after all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even if you're only a pretend boyfriend, I&rsquo;ll still save you.' She added silently in her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I wish you a happy relationship," said Grace as her eyes fell on Valda Theller's face. "Valda, Brian's a good person. I hope you can cherish him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I will. I love Brian very much. I&rsquo;ll cherish him." Valda Theller dutifully &lsquo;acted&rsquo; as his girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Goodbye, then. Let's get together again when we have the chance," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." Valda Theller smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace and Lina left, Valda Theller looked at her right hand that Brian was still holding tightly. His hand still held it tight as if their hands were locked together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... are you going to let go?" she asked in a mutter. After all, his friend was no longer there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers loosened stiffly, and only then did she notice the sweat on his palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you nervous?" Valda Theller asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nervous?" Brian muttered. Maybe he was nervous. He did not expect to let Valda Theller meet Grace so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid that Grace would sense something wrong and would not believe that he was dating Valda Theller. He was scared that everything he had planned would not go his way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Valda Theller was smart enough to realize it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their interlocked hands let go at last. Valda Theller said with feigned ease, "Look, how about I wear this dress to the booting ceremony?"</p></div>
