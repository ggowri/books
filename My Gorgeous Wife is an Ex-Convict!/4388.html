        <h1>Chapter 4386 Just a Friend</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert stared blankly at the person in front of him. Even though he was a year older than her, he couldn't shake the feeling that she seemed much more mature than him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At first, he thought she was like a naive princess, pure and kind.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the more he interacted with her, the more he realized she was different from what he had initially imagined.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was kind, but not foolishly so. She was innocent, yet not oblivious to the darkness of the world. She had her own opinions and principles that she steadfastly upheld.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand," Calvert agreed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then," Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But can we just let them off the hook this time?" He finally spoke after a long silence.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let them both go?" Harley raised an eyebrow.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The girl's parents came to see me. They said that if the case really goes to court, it </span><span>would</span><span> ruin the girl's life. They feared she might even harm herself. After all, her life is at stake too. As for the cleaning staff involved, her husband is a gambler and has racked up a lot of debt. That's why she did what she did. When I visited her in the detention center, she cried and apologized to me many times. My father was also addicted to gambling, so I know what it's like to live with a gambler in the family."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Living like that, it was simply worse than death!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was deep in thought. Initially, she wanted to sue these two individuals as a warning to others. This way, anyone with similar intentions in the future would naturally think twice before acting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But back then, Calvert planned to let those two people go. After all, it was his own business, and she shouldn't have interfered too much.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you really intend to let </span><span>them</span><span> go, then just do as you wish," Harley said. She pulled out her phone and checked the time. It was about time for her to head back. Her parents were waiting for her to come home for dinner tonight. "I'll be going now!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she rose to her feet, planning to leave.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instinctively, Calvert reached out to grab Harley's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" She turned her head towards him in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley saw him biting his lip, his face full of unease as he asked, "Are you mad at me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angry?" She was taken aback, "Why do you think I'm angry?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've gone out of your way to help me, spending a lot of time and effort to catch these two. But now, I'm thinking of letting them go just like that..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hold on!" She interrupted him, "I'm not mad at you. You're my friend, so I'm willing to help you. But no matter what, this is ultimately your issue. You should be the one making the decision. I'm just giving my </span><span>opinion,</span><span> it doesn't mean you have to accept it. However, if you make this decision, you also have to be prepared to deal with the consequences that come with it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her, dumbfounded. Was she </span><span>really not</span><span> angry?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like Harley could see his doubts. She laughed a little and said, "I'm really not angry, and I won't interfere with your final decision. So, just make your decision based on what you think is best. Just like me, even though my friends sometimes give me advice, in the end, I still make decisions based on my own thoughts."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying all that, she added, "Alright, I really have to go now. So, see you next time."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Harley left, Calvert looked at his hand, still warm from her touch. When would they meet again? Would it be a long time from now?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And... why did he feel a sense of loss even though she clearly wasn't angry?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if, to her, he was merely a friend and nothing more!</span></p></div>
