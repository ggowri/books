        <h1>Chapter 3560</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"His face?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"His face makes me afraid to refuse. Refusing him feels like refusing... Lawrence. I refused Lawrence's request once before, and then..." She lowered her head, her voice choking up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that was her deepest pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William hugged Jasper and said, "It's not your fault, don't think too much about it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can I not think about it?" Jasper said bitterly. She had hoped countless times that time could be turned back. If she had chosen to believe Lawrence when he asked her to trust him, she would have believed that he wanted to be friends with her sincerely, not because of her identity or for any other benefits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that were the case, would she have gone to find her parents and continued to seek refuge with the Abbott family? And then, the things that happened later would not have happened?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But everything had no remedy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William, I want to find Lawrence and be good to him, very good to him. I want to do everything possible to make up for the suffering he has endured," Jasper murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's eyes darkened. If it came to it, would Lawrence ask her to make up for it with herself? Would she be willing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he ultimately didn't say those words out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">--</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day at school, Jasper found Roger in the piano room. However, although he was in the room, he wasn't practicing the piano. Instead, he was sitting on a chair next to the piano, resting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was curled up slightly, with his head leaning on the side of the chair, as if he was asleep. He didn't even wake up when she walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper bent down and looked at Roger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at him up close, she couldn't help but feel that he looked more and more like Lawrence from her memories!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And that mole on his neck... could all of this really just be a coincidence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Roger, who was sleeping, suddenly frowned and his head shook slightly. A thin layer of sweat appeared on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at him in confusion. Did he have a nightmare?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As his complexion became paler and his head shook more vigorously, his eyes remained tightly closed, showing no signs of waking up from his dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Roger!" she shouted, trying to wake him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, after calling out several times, it had no effect. He remained in that state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even in his speech, he was murmuring something unclear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She leaned closer to his lips, wanting to hear clearly what he was saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when she finally heard it clearly, she was stunned. He was saying... "Don't hit me... Don't hit me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hit?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was someone going to hit him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What did he dream of again?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper bit her lip and suddenly seemed to have thought of something. She walked over to the piano and sat down, then lifted her hands and began to play on the keys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound she played was very gentle, with a melodious tune, like a mother softly lulling her child to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The music flowed through the room, so beautiful to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Roger, who had been trapped in a nightmare, began to calm down gradually, as if falling into a peaceful sleep again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was playing the piano attentively, so she didn't notice when Roger's eyelashes trembled and then slowly opened. He was stunned when he saw her playing the piano from the side.</p></div>
