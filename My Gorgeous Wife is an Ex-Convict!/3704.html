        <h1>Chapter 3702</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just accompany them for a few words and a few drinks. If they're happy, the business will naturally go smoothly. From now on, your dad and I promise not to force you to attend these kinds of dinner parties again." Rosalind promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica took a deep breath and walked towards her father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Archer saw his daughter coming over, he was happy and immediately greeted her, "Come, this is Mr. Ward from Toyar Group. Veronica, say hello to him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica approached the somewhat overweight Mr. Ward and said, "Mr. Ward, hello, I'm Veronica."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You must be Veronica," Crispin Ward looked at Veronica with a hint of malice and a satisfied smile on his lips. "You're late today, making me wait. How about you punish yourself with three cups?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica frowned, "Sorry, I'm not good at drinking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why be so modest? This drink is no different from a beverage. How about I use smaller cups?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he snapped his fingers and the nearby waiter quickly came over. After receiving instructions, the waiter brought three small cups that were only about an inch tall. Crispin filled them with alcohol and said to Veronica, "Just these three cups, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica glanced at her father's eager eyes and then at the three cups in front of her. The amount was indeed small, so there shouldn't be a problem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pursed her lips, picked up the cup, and drank it all in one go. Then, she quickly drank the second and third cups!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After drinking three cups of alcohol, Veronica felt a burning sensation in her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer had already freed up a seat for Veronica, which happened to be next to Crispin.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crispin looked at Veronica with a smile, "Your father said that Mason from the Reed family used to call you sister. Is that true?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of embarrassment flashed across Veronica's face. She didn't want to be reminded of the past, but it was always cruelly brought up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It was just a nickname we used to play around with. I'm not really Mason's sister," Veronica said. "Besides, I haven't had any contact with Mason for many years now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica tried to distance herself from Mason. She knew her father probably mentioned her relationship with the Reed family to make this deal, but she didn't want to use them or Mason anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she said this, Archer's face turned ugly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Crispin didn't seem to care. He smiled and said, "Come on, let's eat some food. You can't just drink without eating." He then took the initiative to serve Veronica some food and even reached out to hug her with his greasy hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I'm feeling a bit unwell. I need to go to the restroom. Excuse me," Veronica stood up and deliberately avoided his hand, walking towards the door of the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Archer wanted to stop his daughter, but Veronica's footsteps were too fast. Rosalind was about to get up, but saw Mr. Ward had already stood up and chased after her. She immediately sat back down, understanding what was happening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't care what might happen to her stepdaughter. As long as the Barlow family could seal the deal, that was all that mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this deal went through, the Barlow family would have a chance to turn things around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's steps were already faltering as she ran out of the banquet hall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The hall was on the second floor, and as she headed towards the stairs, Crispin intercepted her.</span></p></div>
