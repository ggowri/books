        <h1>Chapter 2811</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze before stepping forward and handing the bottle to Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He held the bottle, hesitated, and put the teat in the little one's mouth to feed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his hands and feet uncontrollably stiffened as he fed the baby. It was a simple movement, but he could not help stiffening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was deeply afraid that the little one in his arms would choke if he fed her too quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the small baby was delicate and frail. It was as if something bad would happen to the baby if he was not careful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla watched Martin Weiss feeding their daughter milk with a gentle expression. Maybe moving here was not too bad after all. At least... her daughter got to receive some fatherly love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing the milk, Kyla began teaching Martin Weiss to burp the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss did not refuse this time. He held the baby vertically and patted her back with one hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He patted the little one repeatedly until she fell asleep during the burping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss carefully put the baby into the crib and covered her with a small quilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the baby, a part of his heart seemed to soften inexplicably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had tried everything to abort the child, even forcing Kyla on the operating table. However, he had mixed feelings as he looked at the baby now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were not for this baby, Kyla's health would not have deteriorated, and he might not have had to donate his liver a second time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll be a good father," murmured Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss turned to look at Kyla and seemingly said sarcastically, "I was never a good father. Have you forgotten that I kept insisting you give up the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you made all the preparations for me to give birth to the baby in the end, didn't you?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So? Why are you telling me about this? Since you said you've moved on, what's the purpose of calling me a good father?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I only hope you and Trista can be close in the future," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said nothing more. He only said, "Go to bed first. I'll go wash up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh... Okay," she replied. She opened the thin quilt and lay down on the huge bed after he entered the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least she would be spared some awkwardness now that she was alone in bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla tried to close her eyes and fall asleep. When Martin Weiss emerged from the bathroom, he saw Kyla lying on the side of the bed near the crib. Her eyes were closed as she was covered with a thin quilt. She looked like she was already asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He bent over slightly as he approached her. His eyes glimmered at the sight of her quivering lashes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, he straightened up, went round to the other side of the bed, lay down, and turned off the lights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The room was instantly dark. Martin Weiss closed his eyes. He knew that the person beside him was not asleep.</p></div>
