        <h1>Chapter 779</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're... tired?" she muttered, merely repeating whatever he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'm tired, so our relationship is over!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's too tiring. If loving someone is so physically and mentally tiring, so insecure, and so uneasy, then I&rsquo;d rather not love at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Brian will always have a place in her heart, I&rsquo;d rather not have the rest.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When his father died in front of his eyes, he vowed to never be like his father&mdash;losing his life for a woman who betrayed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not before, and not in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stood up almost stiffly. Although he was right in front of her, why did she feel so far away?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Last night, he was so intimate to her, and she had felt so happy, yet now... It was like a great irony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's breaking up with me just because he's tired? Then what does our relationship mean to him? Has he only seen it as a game the entire time? However, the difference is that I've trapped myself in it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if... I don't want to break up?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her dignity shattered when she was imprisoned. After being released from prison, he helped her piece together the dignity she had lost little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she said it with her broken dignity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I... love him! I don't want to give up just like that. I want to try one last time!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want to love you anymore," he said in a very indifferent voice. Then, he turned away and walked out of the kitchen as if without a trace of nostalgia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was left alone, standing still in the same spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cold penetrated through her body. It was July, but she was cold as hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she had found the person she could grow old with, but she did not expect that no matter how strong the feelings originally were, breaking up was so simple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All you needed was just one sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want to love her anymore, so he was going to do just that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was ridiculously stuck! What was she to him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The oaths and promises he once said were still ringing in her ear, but looking back now, it was so ridiculous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was still holding the small silver bracelet in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had not told him that he did not need to hide the bracelet, because even though she had recovered her memory, she never intended to tell Brian the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only intended to keep that part of her childhood forever in her memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had made the choice only to give him more security, not to upset him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, these explanations seemed to have become meaningless when he mentioned the words &lsquo;break up&rsquo;!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked bitterly at the small silver bracelet in her hand, then turned her head and looked at the unfinished cake on the kitchen counter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered that he had said he would only make cakes for one person in his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He was so gentle and so sweet&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'My nose feels so sore. I want to cry, I want to let off some steam, but&hellip;' She raised her hand and touched the corners of her eyes.</p></div>
