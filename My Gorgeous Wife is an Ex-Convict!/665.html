        <h1>Chapter 664</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace learned that from her time in prison!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stepped forward and looked quietly at her grandmother who lay in the coffin, knowing it would be the last time she could see her. The kind old woman gave her a lot of love after she lost her mother and made her enjoy her childhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gently placed the flower in her hand in front of her grandmother's coffin and bid her final goodbye in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not go over when Grandma's body was cremated. She was afraid, afraid that she would not be able to stand the sight of her grandmother's body being cremated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grandma left me after all, Jay. There's one less person in the world who truly loves me and treats me well," murmured Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Grace, Jason said, "I won't leave you." 'I&rsquo;ll always be here for you.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I know you won't leave me, and I... Won't leave you too," said Grace. He always gave her peace of mind when she was at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grandma's ashes were cremated and placed in an urn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Lu family buried her grandmother in one of the ancestral graves in the village. Before the town became what it was now and back when it was made up of multiple villages, the people of Lu village and the other villagers were buried here after they passed away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace respectfully offered incense before her grandmother's tombstone and bowed three times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">According to the customs in her hometown, at the first burial, if the deceased was an elder, the youngsters had to kneel and bow to the dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace kneeled and stood up, Jason, much to her surprise, also took three sticks of incense and bowed three times to the tombstone before planting the incense sticks into the incense burner. Then, he lowered his body, knelt before the grave, and bowed respectfully to Old Mrs. Lu.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This kneeling and bowing immediately terrified the Lu family who knew about Jason's identity. After all, with Jason's identity, he must have never bowed to anyone except the ancestors of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was certainly showing Grace a lot of respect by doing so!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay's face paled again, and she made up her mind that one day, she would make Brian care about her like that too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the funeral was over, Grace said to Jason, "Thank you." Thousands of words were in her mouth, but only these two words were uttered out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's nothing to thank me for. She's your grandmother," said Jason. He had looked Grace up and knew the impact the old woman had in Grace's life as well as how she had protected the young Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Reed family's cars were waiting in front of the Lu family's house. There were several black luxury cars lined up outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as the driver saw Grace and Jason, he got out of the car and respectfully opened the car door. The bodyguards who got out of the car even took another trench coat for Jason to change out of his black suit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go," Jason said to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. Now that she was done with her grandmother's funeral, there was no need for them to stay any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd in front of the Lu family's house watched as Jason got into the car with Grace by the hand. Then, the row of luxury cars drove away from the Lu family's house. They just thought it was like watching a movie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace, an ex-convict, had luxury cars to fetch her, and it was a lot showier than Stella Lindsay, who they sought after these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who the hell is Grace's boyfriend?'</p></div>
