        <h1>Chapter 2319</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do to get you to see me and talk to me, so... I could only do this.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I probably loved you," he said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze while doubt flashed across her eyes. He used the word &lsquo;probably&rsquo; and it was strange. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But no matter how much I used to love you, I don't have any love, sympathy, nor tenderness for you anymore. So even if you come to my office every day, I won't give in to your demands just because I feel sorry for you. It&rsquo;ll only make me feel more disgusted," said Martin Weiss. He turned around, and those dark eyes looked at Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those cold eyes seemed to be a bottomless pit, making it impossible to see what he was thinking. They never revealed any emotion too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if all the love he ever felt for her had faded away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know I spoke ruthlessly in the hospital and it made you hate me. Martin Weiss, you can continue to hate me and punish me. I'll accept it, but I beg you to treat these matters separately. As long as you promise to spare Jacqueline Bowman, I'll do whatever you want!" pleaded Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll do anything?" Martin Weiss raised his eyebrows and said nonchalantly, "Then what if I said I want us to act like a real couple and I want you to stay with me for the rest of your life without ever leaving?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her drooping hands clenched slightly as she met his icy gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had said something like that before. His eyes had been full of longing and expectations as though her answer was the most important thing in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he repeated the same lines now, his eyes were cold and indifferent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay!" She heard her own voice answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he sneered. "Kyla, do you really think I'd want you that much again? I only asked to find out how much you despised me back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It could also make him understand how unworthy his love was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him, dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He approached her step by step, raised his hand, and caressed her cheek. It was just like how he had caressed her face in the hospital. "You refused me when I begged you like that, but Amber Mitchell can make you give up the rest of your life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She trembled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice continued ringing in her ears. "Loving you is probably the worst thing I've ever done. Kyla, you've misspoken. I&rsquo;m rejecting your request not because I hate you for being ruthless but because I don't love you anymore. Similarly, I don't hate you. I just don't have feelings for you anymore. So what you just agreed to doesn&rsquo;t have any appeal to me. I don't want the rest of your life. I don't need you by my side either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face turned ghastly pale as she looked a little shaky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hurt you too much, so you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's just that I've forgotten about my feelings for you." His thin lips parted slightly as he uttered the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was confused. "What do you mean? Forgotten?"</p></div>
