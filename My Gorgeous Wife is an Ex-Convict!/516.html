        <h1>Chapter 515</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian even had a hunch that if he did not let go, Jason might just break his wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was really no need to fall out with Jason for a mere woman. After all, Grace was not the one he was looking for. Had he not figured it out earlier?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian lowered his eyes before loosening his fingers with a faint smile, and Grace's wrist was instantly free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, I seem to have forgotten my manners just now. Miss Cummins reminded me of an old friend," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's not your old friend. Don't forget your manners again," Jason said coldly before grabbing Grace's hand and leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes were clouded as he looked at Grace's departing back. Evelyn, who was beside Brian, wanted to scream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she not? She should be! If the portrait she saw in Brian's studio was indeed the old friend Brian was referring to, then she was certain that the girl was Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered the dress Grace wore, what the little girl in the portrait looked like, and the silver bracelet Brian treasured. All these led to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she would keep it to herself and never let it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you say you were going to introduce me to some producers today, Brian?" asked Evelyn, breaking the silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced at the person standing beside him as the cloud in his eyes turned into indifference. He smiled and said, "All right, I'll introduce them to you now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Brian led Evelyn to the other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn held Brian's arm, but she somehow felt uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she was his girlfriend and even though she felt that she was close to him, he exuded a sense of alienation that made it seem impossible to close in the distance between them completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One day, she would bring him to his knees! She wanted to be somebody, she wanted to be better than everybody else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace to a more secluded place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must be tired, sit down for a while," said Jason as he made her sit down on the sofa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine," she said. Though she was nervous as she had not been to banquets like this for a long time, she was more worried about what Brian did earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want something to eat?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Grace could answer, someone came over and said, "Is this your girlfriend, Jason? Won't you introduce me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up and saw a man about Jason's age approaching her. Although he was dressed in a suit, the smile on his baby face made him likable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason glanced at him, then said to Grace, "This is my friend, Patrick."</p></div>
