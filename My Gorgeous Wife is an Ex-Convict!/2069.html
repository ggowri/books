        <h1>Chapter 2067</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm Martin Weiss. Help me find someone. Juliet Harper, a little girl about three years old..." Martin Weiss said to the person on the other end of the phone. He even told them the market Juliet Harper had disappeared from.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once Martin Weiss ended the call, Kyla looked surprised. "How... do you know Juliet is only three years old? And how do you know the name of the market?" She had never told him these!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss stared at the person in front of him. "I know far more than you think I do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did you look Chase Harper and me up?" It was all Kyla could think of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss smiled faintly and did not deny it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked uneasy. "Why did you look Chase Harper up? Don't lay a hand on him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly sneered. He unfastened his seat belt and leaned toward Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla instantly stiffened. Her body seemed to be enveloped in their scent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What... What do you want to do?" she asked uneasily, putting her hands on his chest and trying to put some distance between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss stared at the person in front of him. Years had passed. She was so simple and innocent when they first met. Now, her once innocent and clear eyes were burdened with so many depressing things, but... he loved her more and more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That affection seemed to be fused with heavy regret as it engraved in his bones and blood, making his approach toward her now seem precious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you telling me not to touch Chase Harper? Is that an order? Are you ordering me to stay away from him?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The low steady voice seemed to carry hints of danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla bit her lip, afraid she would say something wrong and piss Martin Weiss off. It would be awful if he transferred his anger to Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Taking a deep breath, she said, "Chase Harper is a friend who helped me when I was in trouble. It has nothing to do with feelings for the opposite sex. I don't want you to involve him because of what happened between us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes glimmered slightly. "Are you speaking up for him? You know what? You rarely speak up for people you don't care about. It seems he means a lot to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He's a good person, and good people always suffer in this society. I don't want a good person to suffer because of me. I can't afford the guilt," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss somehow only felt his heart pricking because of what she just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Martin Weiss's phone rang. It was a call from the person he had asked to find the child. They said that the child had been found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A passerby found the child and took her to the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, thanks. I owe you one," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They chuckled as they said, "Haha, it's not easy to get you to owe me a favor. Who is this little girl? You even asked me to look for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Just a little girl who doesn't matter." Martin Weiss ended the call after saying that. Then, he said to Kyla, "They've found the child. She's now at the police station."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The police station?" Kyla could not believe that they found her so fast.</p></div>
