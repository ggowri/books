        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brow and said irritably, "It was just to avoid being laughed at by others. But there won't be a next time. And if you want to exchange something for your body, you better think it through beforehand. Don't come back and change your mind at the last minute and make a scene! Or did you see me back then and think that I could benefit the Barlow family more than that Toyar Group small business owner? So you chose to come to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words made her body tremble, and suddenly she threw herself at him with all her strength.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them fell to the ground like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pressed down on him, her hands on his shoulders. "Why do you think of me like this? Why? Shouldn't you be the one who knows me best? Even if you were hypnotized, it was just your emotions that were hypnotized, right? You should remember everything between us from the past, right? Then you should know that I didn't start being with you because you could bring any benefits to the Barlow family!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke loudly, as if all the emotions that had been suppressed in her heart for so long could no longer be contained and erupted like a volcano.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears the size of beans flowed from her eyes and down her cheeks, falling onto his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One drop, two drops...they were so hot.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason felt a heavy pressure in his chest, accompanied by an indescribable pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why...why did you hypnotize me!" She choked, "If I misunderstood you, then explain it to me clearly. Say it once, twice, three times, until I don't misunderstand you anymore...but why hypnotize me? Why forget everything we had in the past? Clearly, you said I was the most important person to you...you said we had to rely on each other..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tears fell even more fiercely, and her crying became louder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you know why I hypnotized myself? Is it really just because of that one misunderstanding?" Mason looked at Veronica, who was full of tears, and wondered why he still felt sad when he saw her crying like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, you only see me as a little brother and don't want to love me. But Grace wants me to stay by your side as a brother, isn't that too selfish?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She trembled and closed her eyes, listening to his voice continuing to ring in her ears. "I chose to hypnotize myself just because I didn't want to be burdened by that impossible emotion from before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry..." she murmured, "I know it's too late for anything I say now, we can't go back to the way things were..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if we could go back?" he suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" She was startled, opened her eyes wide, and looked at him in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we could go back, would you love me then? Would you stop treating me like a little brother?" Mason asked, his beautiful black eyes calm as the deep sea, making it hard to read his thoughts.</span></p></div>
