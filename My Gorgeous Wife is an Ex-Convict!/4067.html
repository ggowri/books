        <h1>Chapter 4065</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because in that instant, the atmosphere around Tina changed completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the original Tina, even with makeup, gave Kit a feeling of being naive and sweet, but at this moment, he suddenly wasn't so sure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was this woman in front of him really naive and sweet?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did she exude a dark feeling in that instant, like chaos in hell, giving people a shivering sensation?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at the same time, while shivering, all eyes were drawn to her, making people unable to stop looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if her every glance, every breath, every simple movement gave people a strong sense of presence, making the world in other people's eyes become her own!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even when he came to his senses, he heard the photographer say, "Stop, Kit, what's wrong? Why can't you keep up with Tina's movements?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry!" Kit came back to his senses and said, he was distracted just now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry about it. It's our first time working together, and we haven't gotten used to each other yet. I'll cooperate with you in a bit." Tina winked at Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, in Kit's eyes, she had become that silly and sweet girl again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I'll just cooperate with you!" Kit said. After all, he was a professional, and the girl in front of him was just a rich girl playing around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, you're willing to cooperate with me? That's great!" For Tina, this was clearly a pleasant surprise!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, when filming resumed, Tina immediately wrapped her arm around Kit's waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit's body stiffened, but he quickly suppressed his shock because he realized that Tina was really focused on the shoot and not trying to do anything inappropriate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the moment she wrapped her arm around him, her gaze turned cold as ice, fixed on the camera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their actions were flirtatious, but her eyes were colder than anyone else's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This stark contrast also stirred up Kit's emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least he was a professional, and he couldn't lose to this rich girl!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Kit gradually got into the zone, their bodies moving closer and then apart, light and dark, the contrast becoming more and more apparent!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Between the two of them, there was an atmosphere that no outsider could penetrate, and everyone's eyes were inevitably drawn to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the photographer finally shouted "cut," they stopped all movement, and everyone seemed to snap out of their trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you for shooting with me. It was a precious experience for me! I'll continue to support you in the future!" Tina smiled at Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit looked at the person in front of him, still a little dazed. He felt like he was still immersed in the shoot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a thrilling feeling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How long has it been since you felt this way while shooting a poster?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every time he posed for a poster or a photo album before, he felt like a puppet that could be manipulated at will as soon as the camera was pointed at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just now, he didn't feel that way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Under the lights, Tina walked over and stood next to Eugenia, while Kit continued to shoot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After shooting with Tina just now, Kit obviously found his rhythm and the shooting went smoothly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia watched the shoot and whispered to Tina, "Do you know how amazing you were just now? You and Kit looked like a couple, and the scene we just shot was unforgettable!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her voice was full of excitement!</p></div>
