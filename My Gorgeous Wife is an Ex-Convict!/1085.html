        <h1>Chapter 1084</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. Didn't I tell you last time that he really is your daddy?" said Kyla Corbyn. She never intended to hide the truth from her son for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had planned to wait until the boy turned 18 to tell him, and now it was far ahead of schedule.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why is Daddy only coming back from heaven now?" asked the little one as he turned and looked at Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss almost choked and rolled his eyes at Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was a little embarrassed. 'Why did I tell my son that his daddy was in heaven?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't know you existed, but now that I know, I'll always be with you, Nelson," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Strange to say, he had always been indifferent, but he was unconsciously gentle to his only flesh and blood. He felt sorry, especially when he saw the hearing aid his son wore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though his son was born disabled, he would not let Nelson be inferior to anyone. He wanted his son to be above others and make sure they dared not discriminate against him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one showed a shy but expectant smile. "Can I ride on your shoulders?" Those eyes of his that were similar to Kyla Corbyn's were filled with longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always envied kids who could ride on their father's shoulders. Even though his mother had let him ride on her shoulders before, he still wanted his father to do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Uncle Harper had given him a ride on his shoulders last time and he was so happy. He had also secretly wondered if his father would let him ride on his shoulders if he was around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unexpectedly, his father suddenly showed up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned. 'Ride on my shoulders?' The phrase seemed so far away to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The father and son looked at each other as silence fell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just... letting Nelson ride on your shoulders," Kyla Corbyn could not help explaining.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she did not want Martin Weiss to appear in front of her son too much and disturb their peaceful life, she was more afraid that Martin Weiss would refuse and let Nelson down!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know what riding my shoulders means," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one blinked and said a little pitifully, "Can't I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stared at the beautiful childlike face in front of him. The nose bridge, lips, and overall outline of the little one's face were the same as when he was a child&mdash;but his eyes were very much like Kyla Corbyn's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially when he smiled!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to see the little one smile instead of looking so miserable. "Of course, you can. It's just riding my shoulders. Just tell me whenever you want to ride on my shoulders."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In his opinion, it was stupid to have a child ride on his shoulders, but he just could not refuse the little one's request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one's eyes lit up immediately, and a smile appeared on his face again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was also relieved that Martin Weiss did not reject Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when her eyes inadvertently swept over Martin Weiss, she immediately met his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was looking at her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, the little one talked about what happened in the kindergarten today while the two adults stared at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove to Kyla Corbyn's current rental house, and the three of them got off. Martin Weiss lifted Nelson up as promised and let the little one ride on his shoulders.</p></div>
