        <h1>Chapter 3596</h1>
        <div><p>After finishing her meal, Jasper got up to go to the restroom. When she returned, she noticed that William was no longer in his seat.</p><p>She looked around curiously and saw William outside the restaurant on the side of the road talking to the two elderly scavengers she had seen earlier. After a moment, William opened his wallet and gave all the money inside to the two elderly people.</p><p>The two elderly people took a while to accept the money, and William turned and walked away. The two elderly people seemed to shout something, but because of the glass window and the distance, Jasper couldn&#x27;t hear what they were saying.</p><p>When William returned to the store, he said to Jasper, &quot;Let&#x27;s go, I&#x27;ve settled the bill.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she replied, following him out of Deer Tower and getting into the car.</p><p>As the car headed towards the Barlow House, Jasper asked, &quot;By the way, those two elderly scavengers you gave money to earlier seemed quite pitiful. I wonder if they have any children. They looked quite old, with gray hair, and they were rummaging through the garbage on such a cold day...&quot;</p><p>Jasper&#x27;s words were just casual conversation, but William&#x27;s expression suddenly changed, with a hint of panic in his eyes. &quot;You...you saw it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I saw it when I came back from the restroom,&quot; Jasper said, noticing that something was wrong with William&#x27;s expression. &quot;What&#x27;s wrong? I&#x27;m not going to judge you for anything. I also think those two elderly scavengers are quite pitiful, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with giving them money.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Is...is that so?&quot; William murmured.</p><p>&quot;But if you give them money, it&#x27;s only a temporary solution. Why not help them contact the government relief center and see if they can arrange for a more secure life for the two elderly people?&quot; Jasper suggested after some thought.</p><p>&quot;No need!&quot; William quickly said.</p><p>She looked at him strangely, &quot;Why not?&quot;</p><p>&quot;They should have already applied for government relief, but sometimes, it&#x27;s just a drop in the bucket,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;How do you know they applied?&quot; she asked, puzzled.</p></div>
