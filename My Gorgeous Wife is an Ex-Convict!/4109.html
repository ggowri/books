        <h1>Chapter 4107</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Don't you have anything you want to say to me?" he avoided eye contact, afraid to look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina blinked. "I think it's better for us to have a child sooner rather than later. If I get pregnant, I can take a break from school and continue my studies after the child is born. Besides, I'm already of legal age to get married and have children. It's all good!" she said eagerly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler was stunned, looking at Tina with surprise. He never expected her to say something like that after learning the truth about having a child. She didn't seem angry at all, but rather... eager to have a child with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Do you know what you're saying?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I know," she nodded. How could she not know when she had said the words herself?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Now that you know the truth, aren't you angry? Aren't you furious? Why aren't you blaming me?" Chandler yelled, suppressing his emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Because I'm really not angry or upset," Tina said. "When our families arranged our engagement, it was because I'm a curse breaker and Hunter can save me and my mom. So it was a mutually beneficial transaction from the start!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The terms of the deal were clear from the beginning, so she didn't feel like she was being used.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "And you've been so good to me all these years," Tina continued. "Besides my parents, you've been the person who's been with me the longest!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "That was just using you!" Chandler said hoarsely, avoiding her gaze again. "I just... wanted you to like me, wanted to slowly cultivate a relationship with you, wanted you to not be able to leave me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She didn't say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> There seemed to be a silence in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He laughed bitterly, "You must think I'm despicable, wanting to use your feelings to tie you down since before you were even born..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But I don't think it's that despicable," Tina's voice rang out again. "Although you wanted to use feelings to tie me down, the feelings you put in were not fake!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She knew better than anyone how he had treated her over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She could tell whether it was true or false!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "On the contrary, I think it's pretty good. Fortunately, you could sense me when I was still in my mother's womb, fortunately I have this constitution, so my mother and I could be saved, and I could survive! And then there's you, accompanying me all the way..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She spoke sincerely, every word like a warm current, flowing into his heart, extinguishing his anxiety, panic, and pain...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler stared at her in a daze. He had imagined many times what her reaction would be when she found out the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even if she wanted to cut ties with him now, to leave him forever, he was mentally prepared for it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But he never expected her to describe his purpose as "pretty good," to describe this deceitful relationship that had a purpose from the start with those words!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "In my opinion, there is no such thing as liking or loving someone for no reason in this world. Just like how my parents love me because I am their daughter, and I love them because they are my parents," Tina continued, "If you are good to me because I am the one who can remove the parasites from your body, then I think by now, there must be more than just that reason. If you don't have any other feelings for me, then you should be thinking of finding a way to marry me soon and have children as soon as possible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Instead of postponing the wedding date again and again!</p></div>
