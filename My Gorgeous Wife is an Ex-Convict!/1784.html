        <h1>Chapter 1782</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The paint on this car is made from special materials. It's a new type of paint that Stephenson Group has been researching in the last few years. There are very few in production, so it&rsquo;s precious. Besides, the entire car needs to be repainted after getting scratched, hence the higher cost,&rdquo; the driver answered promptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina felt like she was being conned. 'Special materials that were being developed by Stephenson Group. In other words, how much it costs is up to Hadwin Stephenson!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Sweeney, if you want to settle this formally, you can call the police now," the driver said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The problem was, there was no way she could compensate that much money if she settled this using the formal procedures! Besides, she would have to spend more after she gave birth. If that was the case...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, Lina shuddered and looked down at her flat belly again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Am I... planning on having the baby?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Sweeney, Miss Sweeney..." The driver's voice was still ringing in Lina's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Ah!" Lina came to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Sweeney, if you want to settle this privately, you can talk to Mr. Stephenson," the driver said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked at the back seat of the car where Hadwin Stephenson was. She bit her lip and got out of the car with a grimace. She walked up to Hadwin Stephenson's car, gently tapping on the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car window rolled down, and Hadwin Stephenson was sitting in the back seat. He gave a small smile at Lina and said, "I thought you didn't want to see me, but it seems that you do. Otherwise, you wouldn't have parked here and zoned out, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No. I was just distracted and..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She suddenly stopped halfway through her words when she saw his face darkening. Lina thought of how her car had grazed his car, so she swallowed the rest of her words and said weakly, "Well... why don't we talk about compensation first? I&rsquo;m only insured for 500,000 dollars. Can you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No," he said right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"..." She instantly felt like she had been met with a sharp rebuff. 'Come on. Not long ago, this man talked about how he loves me and can&rsquo;t get over me. But now, he won't even give me a bargain.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you think just because I love you, I should let you have your way and turn a blind eye to this problem?" Hadwin Stephenson asked right away as if he had seen through Lina's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She looked embarrassed. "Uh, I'm not asking you to turn a blind eye. It's just that... I hope you&rsquo;ll accept 500,000 dollars as compensation as that&rsquo;s the limit for my insurance coverage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you want to report this to the traffic police and settle this formally, you'll have to pay whatever amount you owe. If you want to settle this privately..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her eyes lit up. "What about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then get in the car and have a meal with me. We'll talk about it after we eat," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Have a meal with him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What about my car?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said lightly, "Someone will park your car in the underground parking lot, of course. You won't lose it. It's up to you whether to get in the car."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina struggled for a while before finally succumbing to the reality of the situation. She opened the car door and got in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car slowly moved. Lina looked at Hadwin Stephenson, who was sitting beside her. As usual, he was wearing a suit, and his hair was neatly combed. He looked like a perfect gentleman. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina got a little antsy when she thought of how she was carrying their child right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How would he react if he finds out I'm pregnant?'</p></div>
