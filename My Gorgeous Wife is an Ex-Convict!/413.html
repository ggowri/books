        <h1>Chapter 412</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man of high status like Jason probably had endless temptations around him. However, she now knew that his feelings for her were real.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could this relationship last into the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll never fall in love with anyone else. You're the only one I love in this life," said Jason. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Therefore, if I make a mistake, I hope you'll forgive me," he muttered, half-eager and half-coquettish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the reply came out of her mouth, she only felt him hug her tightly once more. "Grace, don't forget what you promised me today. Don't ever forget it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she had promised something of the utmost importance, something she could never forget or go back on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the bathroom, Grace looked at her blushing cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though it had been a while since she hugged and kissed Jason in the living room, the blush on her face was still there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason seemed a little strange tonight, but she could not quite put her finger on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she was just surprised by him telling her he loved her all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of those words, Grace felt nothing but sweetness gushing from her heart. Even in the mirror, the corners of her mouth were rising.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How long had she not felt like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After taking a shower, she came out of the bathroom in her pajamas and found Jason sitting on the edge of her bed. He was looking through the photo album she had left at her bedside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had just bought the album and it contained the photos from the old scorched album. A few of the photos had been burned to pieces though.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, she did not want to lose them. She carefully cleaned the photos and kept them in the album.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You were so cute when you were younger," said Jason as he looked up at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll think I'm beautiful if you compliment me like that again," said Grace in a rare quip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're beautiful to me." He stared at her intently. "There's no woman more beautiful than you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt the flush on her face coming back. While staring at Jason with her sparkling eyes, she did not know what to say for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, are all the photos of you as a child here?" Jason asked casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I suppose so," she said after thinking about it. Back then, taking photos was not as convenient as it was now. Besides, after her mother died, she took fewer photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled and meaningfully said, "Then you'd better keep these photos well. Don't take the album with you everywhere or you'll lose them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I know," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He put down the photo album in his hand, stretched out his long arm, and pulled her into his arms. He sniffed the scent of her body. "Did anything happen today?" he asked in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze for a moment, thinking about the dispute at noon today and the fact that the video of her and Brian had been posted online.</p></div>
