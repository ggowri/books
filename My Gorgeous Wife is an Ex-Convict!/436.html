        <h1>Chapter 435</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Cough! She nearly choked on her saliva. &lsquo;Did he... give a direct call to the traffic police chief? I don&rsquo;t think many within Emerald City can do that.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the red light turned green, Jason continued to drive. This time, Grace began to take notice of the car that Jason mentioned through the rearview mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although there were a few cars in between them, there was indeed a car that kept following them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Grace saw a police car approaching. It forced that car to stop by the roadside. Then, two policemen got down the car... Grace could not see anything else from the rearview mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;This police car was sent out by the chief police?&rsquo; Grace was shaken by the revelation. She also had a further understanding of Jason&rsquo;s influence in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Under the stern glares of the traffic police, Judy Dixon reluctantly took out her identity card and driver&rsquo;s license. She wondered to herself why she was so unlucky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not recall breaking any traffic rules, so why was she chosen to be pulled over by the police?! The car she had been following was nowhere to be seen now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had asked Jillianto snap a picture of the car earlier. She just needed to snoop around to find out who the owner of that car was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the police left, Judy Dixon called her cousin to help her find out the identity of the car&rsquo;s owner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her cousin had a lot of connections, thus it was easy for him to investigate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she had not expected was within less than ten minutes, her cousin urgently called her to question, &ldquo;Judy, who is the person you&rsquo;re trying to investigate?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why? Is there a problem?&rdquo; Judy Dixon curiously asked. She merely wanted to search for a car owner through his number plate. What trouble could there be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her cousin anxiously replied, &ldquo;Of course, there&rsquo;s a problem. The owner of that car is written as &lsquo;top secret&rsquo; in the system. In other words, only certain officials can have access to that data. Nobody else has the right to find out about it. How did you offend such a person?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Judy Dixon was puzzled. She had a look of disbelief on her face. She looked in the direction where the car had long disappeared, and her emotions were in turmoil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Who is that man?!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace and Jason returned to Reed Residence, Jason received a phone call. After the call ended, Jason informed Grace, &ldquo;The car that was tailing us earlier was the two women we met at the elevator.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It was them? Why do they want to tail...&rdquo; Halfway through her sentence, she paused as she realized that the reason the girls followed them was none other than because of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She used to have a female classmate who had a crush on a bus driver. That classmate would take the bus that the driver drove until he finished work. Then, she would follow him from behind to find out his home address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After thinking about such actions, it came off rather creepy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;If they try to do it again, things won&rsquo;t end so easily,&rdquo; Jason said. Then, he looked at Grace and asked, &ldquo;How about you? What are your thoughts about today&rsquo;s incident?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked her eyes a few times and thought about it before saying, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s... rather normal that girls have an interest in you.&rdquo; After all, with his looks, he was no doubt a chick magnet.</p></div>
