        <h1>Chapter 3360</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After returning to the villa, when Valda was giving her a bath and washing her hair, she pitifully said, "Mommy, I got into a fight today. Does that mean I can't go to the amusement park? I really want to go. How about...you give me another task to do? I promise I'll complete it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little one started bargaining.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at her daughter's pleading expression and said softly, "Mommy and Daddy will take you to the new amusement park, just like we said before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Harley's eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, really," Valda said. "Although it was wrong for you to fight today, you did it to protect Mommy. Mommy is very happy. Our Harley is braver than Mommy thought."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley's little face turned red and she seemed a bit embarrassed. "Mommy really thinks...I'm brave?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, our Harley is a brave little one," Valda said. She was truly impressed that a three-year-old child would rush forward like that to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you can't fight like that in the future, okay? Because if you get hurt, Mommy will be heartbroken. It will be even more painful than if Mommy gets hurt herself," Valda added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley immediately said, "I...I won't fight anymore. I won't let Mommy be sad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good girl," Valda smiled and kissed her daughter's tender little face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, how long Harley's promise would last was anyone's guess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In any case, her daughter always made promises very decisively, but could never keep them forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After cleaning her daughter, Valda walked out of the bathroom and saw Brian waiting outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little one, upon seeing his father, immediately exclaimed with excitement, "Daddy, mommy promised to take me to the amusement park!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked at Valda and asked, "Did you agree?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's take her out to play this weekend," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian helped his daughter dry her hair and applied medicine afterwards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctor has already examined the little one before, and there are no major issues, only some minor skin injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When getting medicine, the little one kept humming and muttering, saying "Daddy, it hurts, please be gentle, even more gentle..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked helpless, his gestures were already as light as possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How come you never thought about the pain when you were fighting?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It hurts, but they were talking bad about mommy, so of course I had to make them apologize to mommy!" In short, even if it hurts, I have to stand up for mommy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked at his daughter with a hint of approval in his eyes. Although her fighting caused him headaches, her defense of Valda was commendable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, from now on, let's protect mommy together," Brian said to Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little one blinked and then grinned widely. "Okay, I want to protect mommy with daddy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After their daughter fell asleep, Brian and Valda returned to their room. Valda's face was slightly gloomy, and Brian asked, "Are you still thinking about the fight between the kids today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda nodded and said, "My leg...I'm afraid it will bring a lot of criticism to Harley in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today may have been just the beginning. In the future, how many people will say that her mother is disabled on her daughter's path to growth? Will Harley have to fight every time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was actually very distressed by the injuries her daughter suffered today. Fortunately, they were only minor injuries. If they were serious, she didn't know what to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her leg was incurable and would be like this for the rest of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought she had overcome her psychological problems and bravely faced them, but now it was affecting her daughter.</p></div>
