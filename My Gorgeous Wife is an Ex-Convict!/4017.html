        <h1>Chapter 4015</h1>
        <div>.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can you not go back to Emerald City? You're pregnant with your elder brother's child, so of course you have to go back to Emerald City!" Jasper blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Nancy's bulging belly made it obvious to anyone that she was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And before they came here, they had already learned all about Nancy's situation in the past few months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They knew that she had been discovered and had been in a coma for five months, during which time she was found to be 25 weeks pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's body suddenly stiffened. "No, the child is not Mick's!" This was almost without thinking, instinctively coming out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the atmosphere in the room became awkward, as if it had suddenly fallen silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but for a moment he didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Mick who spoke, "You guys go out first, I'll talk to Nancy alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people in the ward filed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only Mick and Nancy were left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick stared at Nancy. "Why did you say the child isn't mine?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because... the child really isn't yours," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The child is 25 weeks old now. Counting the days, it should be the time we had sex!" Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Reed shouldn't think that one time is enough to get pregnant, and besides, you saw me take birth control pills with your own eyes," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In any case, she couldn't let Mick think that the child was his!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wants to keep this child, her only family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it's not mine, then whose is it?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't need to know that. Mr. Reed, have you forgotten that we agreed to be strangers with no relationship in the future?" Nancy tried to remain calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words made Mick's heart skip a beat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you blaming me for how I treated you back then? I can apologize, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have..." Mick tried to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!" Nancy interrupted Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His humble attitude towards her at this moment made her uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not blaming you. I'm the one who should apologize to you. You were kind to me back then. I just want to say..." She took a deep breath. "The child is not yours, it has nothing to do with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then who is the child's father? Tell me!" Mick said. He didn't believe there was another man when they were together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides, he knew that when they had sex, it was her first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just a stranger, I don't know him. After we separated, I had a relationship with that person because of an accident, and that's how I got pregnant." She made up a story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Making up a non-existent person would make it impossible to prove otherwise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway - this child is mine, and I will raise him/her well. The child only has a relationship with me!" Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick stared at Nancy and suddenly said, "If you want to know if the child is mine, it's easy to do a DNA test after the child is born."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His tone sounded like he was sure the child was his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You--" Nancy stared at Mick, momentarily speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they really did a DNA test, then everyone would know who the child's biological father is.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is my child, you have no right to do this!" she protested, feeling guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this only proved who the child belonged to!</p></div>
