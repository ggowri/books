Wasn't that girl coming to see you? Why did she leave on her own?" old Mr. Hunter </span><span>furrow</span><span>ed</span><span> </span><span>his brows, asking his grandson.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler </span><span>smile</span><span>d</span><span> </span><span>wryly</span><span> and replied,</span><span> "Tina already knows."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She knows about my curse</span><span>.

Chandler immediately </span><span>spoke</span><span> </span><span>up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think </span><span>it&rsquo;s only about the two of you</span><span>?" the old Mr. Hunter </span><span>snapped</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will save my</span><span>self</span><span>, grandfather, you can rest assured," Chandler </span><span>look</span><span>ed</span><span> </span><span>straight at the old Mr. Hunter</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>"But you also know how important Tina is to me.

But I hope Tina is truly worth it for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler lowered his gaze and said softly, "She is worth it."</span></p></div>
