        <h1>Chapter 3191</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you planning to live in Brian's villa or the Hart family mansion after marriage?" Camille asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll stay in the villa, where I can have more privacy. But on weekends, I'll spend one day at the Hart family mansion and one day at my small apartment with my godmother," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did Brian agree to that?" Camille asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, that's good. It's rare for a prince like Brian to be willing to spend one day a week with you in your small apartment after marriage," Camille said. "By the way, when do you plan to take your wedding photos?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wedding photos?" Valda was puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't tell me you forgot that you have to take wedding photos after getting married," Camille joked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked embarrassed. She had actually forgotten about it, mainly because she had been too busy lately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, you can think about where to take your wedding photos. Many people like to go abroad for their wedding photos," Camille said. Although taking wedding photos abroad can be expensive, it's not a big deal for Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda couldn't help but ponder, where to take wedding photos?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she really had to take wedding photos, she would prefer to do it in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because this city is where they both grew up and also where they fell in love and met each other!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the evening, when Valda and Brian were video calling, she asked, "Brian, have you thought about when we should take our wedding photos?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm fine with it, but I can see that you're busy lately. I was actually planning to bring up this matter with you at a later time," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I estimate that we'll have some free time next week," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you have a place in mind for where to take photos?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Regarding Emerald City, what do you think?" she asked for his opinion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's shoot in Emerald City. Do you have any favorite photographers?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shook her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go find a good photography team. If you have any ideas for the shoot, you can discuss them with them," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm," Valda responded, already imagining what it would be like to take wedding photos with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wedding photos... I'm actually really looking forward to them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda couldn't help but smile sweetly, as if she was starting to feel the reality of getting married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A week later, after Valda finished her work, Brian's wedding photography team was also ready to shoot the photos. They discussed their ideas for the shoot with Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda also had many ideas and she hoped that these wedding photos could have an additional layer of meaning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take a set of photos under the big tree?" Brian looked at the itinerary and turned to ask Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm," she nodded. "That big tree is where we first met and it feels like the place where all our fate began, so I want to take a set of photos over there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If at that time, he hadn't stood under that tree and she hadn't given that casual glance, perhaps none of these things would have happened between them. Maybe they would have missed each other like that.</p></div>
