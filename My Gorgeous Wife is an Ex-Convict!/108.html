        <h1>Chapter 107</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">All of a sudden, he felt a twinge of pain in his heart. She had clearly been fine when she had left this morning, but now... she had been turned into this pitiful state. If he had come with her earlier in the day, she would not have encountered such a thing.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he wanted to get close to her, her body shook even more, and the hand she was using to hold the mirror shard tightened its grip. Suddenly, the blood in her hands surged even more.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, it's me. Relax. You're safe now. No one will do anything to you anymore," Jason said anxiously.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the past, he had never been afraid of blood. Even if someone had dripped blood in front of him, he would not have been moved at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, at this moment, he was afraid of her blood. He was afraid that her injuries would worsen and that she would keep on bleeding.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This kind of fear made his body tremble.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace felt as if her body had lost all sensation and control. She could only feel the heat and slight pain.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only when she was in pain could she protect herself and keep herself from falling asleep.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I can't sleep here, I absolutely can't!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Being isolated and helpless, she had once thought that when she was released from prison, she would be in charge of her own life. However, nothing had changed. Once something had happened, no one could help her! She could only bear this pain alone...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis... sis..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A voice rang in her ears. "Who is it? Who is calling out to me?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She tried her best to open her eyes, trying to see who was calling her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, don't be afraid, I will take you away from this place!" the person said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her vision, which had no focus, started to clear up little by little. Her dark pupils then finally reflected the man's figure.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"J... Jay..." She said his name with difficulty. Her voice was so hoarse that it sounded as if her throat had been scratched with sand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's me. No one can hurt you once I'm here!" He said, his handsome face serious. He was heart-broken when he made his oath.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at him in a daze. At this moment, it seemed that there was something different about Jay, but... it was still Jay!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As if all the strength she had been struggling to hold on to had been drained, her hand suddenly loosened, and the shard of mirror in her hand fell. She also fell to one side.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He stretched out his arms to catch her, then directly took off his coat, wrapped it around her, and picked her up.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, go to sleep. I'll take you back," Jason said softly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leaning on his chest, she could feel his familiar aura. It was as if she was no longer alone at this moment. There was someone else that she could rely on.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jay, you're finally... here..." she muttered. Her head tilted as she leaned into his embrace, gasping for breath.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, I'm here," he replied as he stared at the person in his arms. She didn't have to be afraid of anything!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he spoke, he carried her out of the room.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The people outside saw Jason walk out holding a woman wrapped in a man's suit. They could not see the woman's appearance at all as her face was almost buried in Jason's arms. Only her long hair could be seen outside the suit. One could still hear the woman's breathing, which was very heavy at that moment.</p></div>
