        <h1>Chapter 369</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Then you can make any request you want,&rdquo; she replied. After all, she only had a limited amount of money and only one life to give.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was taken aback for a moment. &lsquo;Did he just... agree to my request? He&rsquo;s being rather easy-going.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your hand? Is it still burning?&rdquo; He shifted his gaze back to her hand that was still under the running cold water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t hurt as much now. Since it has been under the water for some time, I think it should be fine,&rdquo; she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He then turned off the tap and took out his handkerchief that he always carried with him to wipe her hand dry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Do you have any ointment at home? It still looks quite swollen. It&rsquo;s better if you apply some ointment.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Oh, we do.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Bring it here now.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina ran to her room to fetch the ointment for burned skin. When she got hold of the ointment, she suddenly realized. &lsquo;Why am I so obedient?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, that remained as a thought. She still took the ointment and came out of her room. When she stepped out, she saw Hadwin in the living room chatting with her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she came nearer, she heard her mother say, &ldquo;Oh, so that&rsquo;s it. Lina sent you back to your hotel room after you got drunk and took care of you the whole night. Lina is a kind-hearted girl. We always teach her that it is a joyful thing to be able to extend help to those in need.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Lina heard those words, she nearly slumped on the floor from having weakened knees. &lsquo;Kind-hearted? A joy to extend help?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&lsquo;If Mom knew what &lsquo;good deeds&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve done, she won&rsquo;t be saying those words at all.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Indeed. If not for her meticulous care, I might have been in a worse condition. Sometimes after getting drunk, there is a risk of asphyxiation when the vomit gets into the airway,&rdquo; Hadwin said and looked over at Lina. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m truly grateful for Lina.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That sentence made Lina extremely guilty!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her parents then added, &ldquo;Oh please. That was something she needed to do. We&rsquo;re all fellow countrymen, so of course we need to help each other when we&rsquo;re abroad.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina wanted to dig a hole to bury herself in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Hadwin waved a hand at her. &ldquo;Come, come. Sit here.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She obediently followed his instructions and sat next to him. Once she sat down, she realized that she had been too obedient and felt like a pet dog listening to the command of her owner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&lsquo;Eeks! Yucks! I&rsquo;m not some pet dog!&rsquo; She immediately comforted herself inwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin took the ointment from her hand, lowered his head, and applied the ointment on the burnt area of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. and Mrs. Sweeney looked at each other when they saw what he did. Subsequently, Mrs. Sweeney asked in a friendly tone, &ldquo;Hadwin, what other family members do you have? Have your parents retired?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;My late father has passed away. My mother has been living abroad all this while and has no plans of returning,&rdquo; Hadwin replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Do you have any siblings?&rdquo; Mrs. Sweeney continued to probe.</p></div>
