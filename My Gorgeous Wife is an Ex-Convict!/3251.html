        <h1>Chapter 3249</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The body's senses seem to be constantly expanding, as if emotions that were once suppressed deep inside are now gushing out. The pain, oppression, and despair are gradually enveloping his entire being.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I feel terrible! It's so unbearable that he almost wants to die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin had one hand pressed against his temple, while the other hand tightly gripped the collar of his shirt at the chest. He was curled up and about to collapse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla quickly supported him, "Martin, are you okay?" she asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the pain on his face far exceeded her imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She never imagined that he would be in so much pain after she uttered the code to release him from hypnosis!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body weight suddenly pressed onto her, causing her to lose her balance and both of them fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, there was a carpet laid on the floor of the suite, so the fall wasn't too painful. However, Martin's weight was mostly on Kyla, causing her bones to ache a bit from the pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, at this moment, she couldn't care about herself, only worried about him. "Martin, how are you? Are you okay?" Kyla asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin's face was unusually pale, with beads of sweat on his forehead, and he was clenching his teeth tightly against his lower lip, as if he was fighting against something... His facial expression and bodily reactions were telling her how much pain he was in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Kyla suddenly regretted it. She didn't expect him to be in so much pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did she act too hastily in deciding to lift his hypnosis in the end?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Martin, how are you feeling? Are you in a lot of pain? I...I can take you to the hospital!" Kyla said, quickly trying to stand up and grab her phone from the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had just stood up and taken a step when suddenly her foot froze in place. A hand had grabbed her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That is... Martin's hand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, a hoarse voice sounded, "No need... to go to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla turned around blankly and looked at Martin. He slowly stood up from the ground, his pale complexion and slightly bleeding lips from being bitten made him look weak and frail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, there was no longer any pain on his face, which slightly eased her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How are you feeling? Do you still feel any pain or discomfort?" she quickly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyelashes trembled slightly as he looked up at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those deep black eyes, however, were not as gentle as before, but rather sunk like an endless abyss, causing her heart to suddenly sink as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla just realized it now - earlier, she said the code to break the hypnosis, so now he... the hypnosis has been broken!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Have all those emotions that were once buried by him now returned?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The painful entanglements between them, even though he remembered and knew what had happened, ultimately, without that emotional connection, it was just like watching someone else's story, and it never left a deep impression on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, since he has regained those feelings, how will he view her? How will he view their relationship?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Will he still hate himself for begging her to forgive him and be with him, despite her cold and heartless rejection of his plea to let go of the past?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though there were many obstacles between them back then, which prevented them from being together, ultimately it was her who hurt him and chose not to be with him.</p></div>
