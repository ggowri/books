        <h1>Chapter 1325</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick, who was nearby, sighed. Who would have thought that Brian, who used to change girlfriends frequently, would be this way once he was love-struck? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Things might have been easier if it were a different woman, but the woman was the one Jason was attracted to and she was now even married to Jason. As such, Brian's feelings were doomed to be fruitless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick patted his best friend on the shoulder and consoled him, saying, "There's plenty of fish in the sea. Maybe once you get over Grace, you'll find&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Patrick, have you ever been in love?" Brian asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was instantly stunned. He then heard Brian saying, "If you've ever been in love, you'll know that no matter how many women there are in the world, there'll only be one woman who has caught your attention and heart. You'll never want anyone else except her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'You&rsquo;ll never be attracted to other women and fall for other women as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I've spent all my feelings on one woman during my years of searching that I can't take them back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could I ever fall for another woman?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His love was already over when he found out the truth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">... </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was already at home when Grace returned to Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you home early today?" she asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I finished work early and came home," he said. He pulled her onto the couch as he spoke. He lifted her feet and gave her a gentle massage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace enjoyed the massage from her husband.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had some swelling on her legs and feet these days, but it was not that bad. However, she heard it would get worse when she was further along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he massaged her legs and feet at home according to the massage techniques taught by the specialist in the hospital's pregnancy course.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would really feel quite comfortable after the massage, so he would massage her a few times every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you go to the hospital to see Lina today?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Yeah. The doctor said Lina would wake up soon. I wonder if Lina will be able to see Hadwin Stephenson when she wakes up. By the way, have your men been able to get in touch with Hadwin Stephenson yet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason hesitated a little. "What if Hadwin Stephenson has changed? Do you still want Lina to see him when she wakes up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned and asked in confusion, "What do you mean? Hadwin Stephenson has changed? In what way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "The Jackson family and Hadwin Stephenson are probably going to take on the Stephenson family's first wife soon. I'm afraid it's time for them to reap their harvest. My men have tried to contact Hadwin Stephenson, but... Hadwin Stephenson doesn't seem to want to get in touch with the outside world. I suppose he doesn't want anything to affect what he has planned."</p></div>
