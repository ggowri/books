        <h1>Chapter 922</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was rendered speechless. 'What does that mean? Am I a mascot?' Shaking her head, Grace threw the jumbled thoughts out of her head and refocused on the case files in her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Baldwin's trial was about to begin in a few days. According to the defendant's attitude, it was clear that she wanted to put it off and not pay them any compensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A year behind bars could wipe out millions in damages which was a bargain for the defendant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she was now 70 or 80 percent sure that the real culprit was the actress Elise Dean, the evidence she had was not strong enough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Maybe... by revisiting the route the car took or the crime scene, I might find something useful,' Grace thought to herself. After all, it was all she could do now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, when the case did come to trial, even if they won, Baldwin and his family would not receive any compensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you looking at? Why are you so focused?" Jason's voice suddenly rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly realized that Jason's video conference had ended and he was now by her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was bent over with one hand on the desk while looking down at the files in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. It's just a case from the firm," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you really going to be only a mere paralegal in this firm? Don't you want me to help you? I can give you a law firm. You&rsquo;re now licensed to take cases on your own. You don't have to be a paralegal at all," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I just want to gain some experiences," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to say no?" His voice deepened, and the air around them seemed tense again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip a little. "Jason, you don't need to give me anything. I'm thankful enough that you were willing to get someone to protect Kyla and Nelson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she wanted now was independence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he did give her a firm, it would not be hers. It would be like a castle in the air, gorgeous but unreal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If one day he wanted to stop giving her things, he could take back those things he had given her at any time. When that happened, she would have nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers caressed her lip to stop her teeth from biting it. "Why are you so reluctant to call me Jay? You only call me that when I make you do it. Is it so difficult for you to take the initiative to call me that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Difficult? It's not difficult. I just have to think of it as a title, but... Maybe it's because the word 'Jay' used to be so special to me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now he was only Jason to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Calling him Jay would probably give her the misconception that he was still Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, should she say that Jay had only lived in her imagination? She never really knew him. That was why she was so shocked when he wanted to break up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Jay in her heart was just a creation of what she wanted, not the real him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Call me Jay. I like it when you call me Jay," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay..." she uttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Say it again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay... Jay..."</p></div>
