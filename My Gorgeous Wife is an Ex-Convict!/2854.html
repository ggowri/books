        <h1>Chapter 2852</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, he added, "I did save Whitney Cooper abroad because she looked like Grace, but I know very well that she isn't Grace. It&rsquo;s just because she looks like Grace that I didn't want her to suffer again and offered her a job."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller did not expect Brian to say so much to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never been one to explain, but he seemed to be explaining to her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian easily saw the confusion on Valda Theller's face and said, "I&rsquo;m explaining this to you so that you won't get the wrong idea."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller nodded blankly. "Oh. But she seems to know a lot about you." She sounded jealous when she said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you? You can ask anything you want to know about me and I'll tell you." Brian caressed her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I want to know about what happened between you and Grace, will you tell me?" she blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying that, Valda Theller felt the air freezing suddenly. The man in front of her only stared at her. His dark phoenix eyes were like a bottomless pool. People would not know what he was thinking. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller gulped uneasily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew she could lighten the mood by saying that she was only joking. Perhaps things between then would then return to normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she wanted to know him better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, she said, "It's fine if you don't want to tell me. I'll wait for when you're willing to tell me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she might never get that chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you want to know what happened between Grace and me?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's because... I love you." She loved him, so she wanted to know him better. She wanted to know his pain better. Just like the first time she saw him. He was in the rain, looking so lonely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was silent. Just before Valda Theller thought he would not go on, he finally said, "Grace and I met when we were little. I was kidnapped back then and escaped into the hills but lost my way. She carried me down the hill. I promised her I would do my best to protect her and give her a good life, but... I forgot to ask her name and where she lived. We met again years later. She had already fallen in love with Jason when I recognized her as the little girl I was looking for."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the first time he had ever spoken about his past with Grace in front of anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice continued. "It's as if I'm always missing out... I met Grace first, but I repeatedly missed out on her. It was already too late when I found out the truth. The reason I chose to date you in the beginning is that Grace wanted me to move on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice paused as he gazed at her. "Do you still want to love me knowing this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you mean it when you said you liked me afterward?" she asked instead of replying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he said. He had no idea when he started falling for Valda Theller, but he had grown accustomed to her presence. He always wanted to see her with a smile on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when he was in a bad mood, seeing her smile made his bad mood go away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said sternly, "That's all that matters. I loved you when you didn&rsquo;t like me. Now that you've begun to like me, why would I not love you? Thank you for telling me all this, and thank you... for asking me to be your girlfriend and not letting me miss out on you."</p></div>
