        <h1>Chapter 1145</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had bought her the apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before, she just thought Brian was nice to her and would buy her anything she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after seeing him with Grace, she found that when a man wanted to be nice to a woman, it was not about the material things but the gentleness from the inside. This was what would let people know right away whether a man cared about a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian cared a lot about Grace now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who was Grace to steal Brian from her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know why her cousin had recovered her memory but chose not to say it out. Since she had chosen not to say it, then she should not be getting so close to Brian! She even made Brian fall in love with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the elevator reached the floor where Stella's apartment unit was on, Stella opened the door and walked in. Before she could close the door, a figure darted into the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then the door was shut!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was about to scream, but the next moment, their voice stopped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Lindsay, have you forgotten me so quickly? I helped you to move the surveillance camera!" they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella shuddered. Was this not the voice... of the cleaner she had hired to do the job? However... the person in front of her now did not look like the cleaner in her memory. She... was dressed a lot more stylishly, and without the glasses and hat, her temperament looked different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing here? Haven&rsquo;t... Haven&rsquo;t I paid you? What more do you want? If anyone finds out that you're the one who locked the lounge door, you'll go to prison!" said Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her poor argument elicited a derisive laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I'm going to prison, then you probably deserve to go to prison more, Miss Lindsay. You're the one behind it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Stella's face turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Evelyn!" She made it clear who she was. "Speaking of which, I should call you &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's eyes widened immediately. She could hardly believe that this dull, average-looking woman was Evelyn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Evelyn? She's Evelyn? But she doesn&rsquo;t look like the Evelyn in my memory at all!' Though they were relatives, they were not related by blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had seen Evelyn a few times as a child, but she had never seen her as an adult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The last she had ever seen of Evelyn were some of her photos online. When she heard that Evelyn had also been Brian's girlfriend previously, she looked up her photos and thought she was pretty!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now it seemed that Evelyn looked much worse than Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least Grace looked pretty good without makeup, but the Evelyn in front of her looked a lot different from those online photos of her with makeup on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella even felt she was just as good-looking as Evelyn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you do it on purpose? Just to make me think you're a mere cleaner? What do you want?" Stella was fuming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn sneered, "It's a good thing you found me. If it were anyone else, you wouldn't know how you had failed by now! It doesn't matter if I'm a cleaner or not. What matters is... do you want Grace to get into trouble?"</p></div>
