        <h1>Chapter 2920</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word "breakup" seemed to stimulate him, and he suddenly smiled. "Yes, we broke up, so you can go love Raymond Bowman again, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, his lips heavily kissed hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The intense and domineering kiss made her almost breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, this can't go on, or else she will...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her teeth bit down, and a bloody smell filled her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, his kiss ended, and he straightened up. A touch of crimson appeared at the corner of his lips, looking so shocking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, do you resist me like this? You would rather kiss Raymond Bowman than kiss me?" His pitch-black eyes stared at her, questioning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I didn't kiss Raymond Bowman..." She denied again, but before she finished speaking, he had already taken out a stack of photos from his pocket and slammed them on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, you still want to say you didn't? Are you going to tell me that these photos are fake? Or that the person in these photos isn't you?" He spoke sternly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller crouched down and picked up the photos from the ground, finally seeing them clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was at the wrap party, when she used the excuse of going to the bathroom and stood at the end of the corridor talking to Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But she didn't expect that someone had secretly taken photos at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And some of these photos looked like Raymond Bowman was holding her and kissing her, just like a borrowed scene in a movie or TV show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The person in these photos is me, and I was indeed talking to Raymond Bowman at the time, but..." She picked out a few photos that looked ambiguous from different angles. "But these few photos are not what they seem. At that time, he didn't hold me or kiss me. It was just a matter of angle, which created this illusion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" He said, but his expression clearly didn't believe her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller felt a sourness in her heart. "Okay, even if he really kissed me and held me, so what? Brian Hart, we have already broken up. Even if I really slept with Raymond Bowman, you have no right to question me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, are you planning to sleep with Raymond Bowman?" His voice suddenly became cold, and a layer of gloom covered his handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">An instinctive sense of crisis reminded her to escape, and her body had already instinctively moved back step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian Hart, we...we have already broken up. Please leave my house..." Valda Theller's voice trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't agree." He said, "Valda Theller, I don't agree to break up, and you can't break up with me either!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he took a big step forward, picked her up horizontally, and walked towards her bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face suddenly turned pale, and she immediately understood what Brian Hart was going to do next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I don't want to...Brian Hart, put me down!" She shouted, desperately trying to jump out of his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But his strength made her struggles seem useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He threw her onto the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could sit up, his body had already pressed down on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, I told you not to lie to me, and you can't break up with me. I won't let you be with Raymond Bowman. I won't!" He spoke, and his lips kissed hers again.</p></div>
