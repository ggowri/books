        <h1>Chapter 1095</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The room was quiet now. There was no one else in the room except him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she... not around?' He lowered his eyes gently and stared at his empty hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he had forced her to stay in the mansion, she still would not stay with him. Just like his father and mother. Though he had desperately begged them to stay, they still left him in their own way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I going to be all alone after all?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Alone, just like before... Why should I care? Wasn&rsquo;t I alone before I met her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The only person I can rely on is myself!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, even if he thought so, there was still a pain spreading throughout his body as if there were dense needles pricking him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the door was suddenly pushed open and a figure walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared blankly at the approaching figure with a touch of surprise in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh? You're awake. I&rsquo;ve just made some porridge. I meant to give it to you when you woke up later." Grace put the porridge on the bedside table beside him as she spoke. Naturally, she reached out her hand to his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Hmm, his temperature has dropped. It still feels a little hot though, but it's much better than before.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your temperature has dropped. I'll take your temperature with the ear thermometer later," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you&hellip; go to make porridge?" murmured Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "Yes, I calculated the time and knew you were going to wake up soon, so I went down to make porridge. However, you woke sooner than I expected. The porridge is still a little hot. Let it cool for a while before you eat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He replied hoarsely, "Okay. Have you... been in this room all this time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where else could I go?" she asked, especially when he had nightmares earlier and slept restlessly. From time to time, he would stammer something and she had to play along and reply to him so he could sleep well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing that he was sleeping better, she found time to go to the kitchen and make some porridge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared blankly at the woman in front of him. The pain spreading in his body seemed to be disappearing bit by bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She was here all along. She was with me all along. I'm not alone!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He opened his arms and wrapped them around her waist. He pressed his face against her lower abdomen as he gently closed his eyes. "It's a good thing you didn't leave me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened immediately. Jason's hug was not that tight. She knew that she could push his hands away with just a little push.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her hands seemed so heavy now that she could not lift them to push him away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because I'm overwhelmed by his vulnerability and attachment?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze and let Jason hold her. Sometime later, he finally loosened his arms when the porridge had turned cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Eat... your porridge." She finally managed to find her voice. Then, she filled a bowl of porridge from the pot with a small spoon and handed it to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his hand to take it, but he was so weak that the bowl of porridge in his hand almost toppled onto the bed.</p></div>
