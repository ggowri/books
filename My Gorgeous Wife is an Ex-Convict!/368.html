        <h1>Chapter 367</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The elevator got here after a short while. However, the people who got out were Lina&rsquo;s neighbors. When they saw Lina, they started greeting her. &ldquo;Lina, you&rsquo;re back. This must be your boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her neighbor said and kept looking at Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina hesitated. Before she could get back to her senses, Hadwin opened his mouth and replied, &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m Lina&rsquo;s boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Hehe, I think I&rsquo;ll be able to attend your wedding party soon.&rdquo; The neighbor laughed before saying urgently, &ldquo;Lina, your mother has been nagging the entire day. She&rsquo;s waiting to meet your boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was feeling awkward. She finally knew why her neighbor knew that Hadwin was her boyfriend. It seemed that her mother had already announced this to everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They walked into the elevator. Lina looked at Hadwin. The other party was looking at her with a half-smile on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blushed uncontrollably. She hesitated for a while and reminded him. &ldquo;Um&hellip; My parents might be a little worried since I&rsquo;ve never had a boyfriend before. Just deal with them the best you can later, okay? I&rsquo;ll find an excuse to bring you out.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What? You&rsquo;ve never had a boyfriend before?&rdquo; He lifted his eyebrows and bent down. He stared at her with his deep, black eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina&rsquo;s heart sped up. As someone who was obsessed with looks, it was easy to make her heart speed up. She just had to look at a beautiful face like his. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Haha&hellip; I&rsquo;m busy with work, so I never had one,&rdquo; she answered awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Really? I thought you'd say that you still can&rsquo;t forget about me. It would&rsquo;ve made me happier,&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She almost choked on her saliva.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could not forget about him? Really?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Alright, she would recall everything back then and treat it as a dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ding dong!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The elevator got to their floor and both of them walked out of the elevator. Lina walked to her house, taking out her keys to open the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she pushed open the door and saw her parents, she almost got blinded by them. Her father was wearing a suit that he only wore when he was taking pictures while her mother was wearing the new clothes she bought not long ago. She even did her makeup and tied her hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Judging by the hairstyle, she knew it was by the boss lady of the salon in their residential area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina had a feeling that every middle-aged woman in her residential area knew that she was bringing her boyfriend home today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the boss lady of the salon was famous for being a blabbermouth. Whenever she got wind of someone else&rsquo;s business, it would mean that the entire residential area would know about it too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked at her parents awkwardly. She noticed her parents were looking at Hadwin weirdly. On the other hand, Hadwin looked unperturbed like he was not affected at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Dad, Mom, this is Hadwin, my&hellip; um, boyfriend.&rdquo; It was as if she wasted a lot of effort just to say that word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Uncle, Aunty, hello, I am Hadwin.&rdquo; Hadwin greeted Mr. and Mrs. Sweeney respectfully.</p></div>
