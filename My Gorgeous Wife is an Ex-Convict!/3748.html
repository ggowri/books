        <h1>Chapter 3746</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her with a stunned expression, as if surprised by what she had just said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And if I always choose the easy path, then I can't make myself stronger. Then in the future...um, I mean, if we really have a future, it will become a situation where only I rely on you, but you can't rely on me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned. Somehow, when he heard her say "if we really have a future," he felt unhappy. Did she think that they might not have a future together?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to be my reliance?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She pursed her lips. Actually, she had always wanted to be his reliance. "I...want to be someone like Auntie Grace," Veronica's face turned slightly red, feeling a bit embarrassed. "Although Uncle Reed is very powerful, Auntie Grace shines in her own field, and she has also handled many cases for Reed Group, which has reduced Uncle Reed's worries."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she hoped that in the future, she could also be like Auntie Grace, and solve many troublesome things for the person in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason finally stopped asking and the food was served.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them began to eat, and Veronica thought about whether her words just now had made him unhappy. After all, he had frowned while she was speaking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she didn't want to hide anything from him and wanted to express her true thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, they had finally started to get along again, and she didn't want any misunderstandings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a voice suddenly sounded, "Hey, isn't that Veronica? What a coincidence to meet you here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica turned her head and saw that the person who had just spoken was Vanessa Thompson, one of her classmates. Vanessa was a rich second-generation, and her friends were also part of her clique because Vanessa was generous. In the class, these few people were considered a small group.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's a coincidence," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're having dinner with someone, at such a fancy restaurant. Aren't you still working hard to support yourself?" Vanessa said with a smile that seemed like a casual inquiry, but the tone of her voice easily revealed her ill intentions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica smiled faintly, "Well, I'm having dinner here with a friend. Working hard to support myself shouldn't conflict with having dinner here. After all, I didn't apply for any scholarships for impoverished students, and I work outside of school, not in the positions designated for impoverished students."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, even if she only earns a few thousand yuan a month, it's her own business if she wants to eat a meal worth tens of thousands of yuan. It's not up to others to judge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's words obviously made these people unhappy. Vanessa glared at Veronica. Recently, rumors had been circulating around the school that Veronica was often picked up by luxury cars at the school gate. Naturally, she had played a part in spreading these rumors.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The man who drove to pick up Veronica every time was at least 40 years old. It was obvious that Veronica was being kept by someone. But now, she was having dinner at such a high-end restaurant with such a handsome man. It was hard to look at.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Vanessa's eyes, Veronica was just a poor person at the bottom of society. What qualifications did she have to dine at such a nice restaurant like her?</span></p></div>
