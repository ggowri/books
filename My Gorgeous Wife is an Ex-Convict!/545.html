        <h1>Chapter 544</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This child is..." asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's... A friend's child," mumbled Grace, not wanting to expose Kyla's identity. "Thank you for bringing the child here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing," said Martin Weiss, his eyes could not help looking at the little one who was clinging to Grace's legs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the restroom, all he could see was that the child seemed to be desperately searching for something. His little face was so nervous, anxious, and scared. Martin Weiss could not help but stop in his tracks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Strangely enough, he was not a busybody, but when he saw the child, he could not stop himself from finding out why the child was so nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only he did not realize that the child could not hear at all. He had a hearing disability. The child babbled some words after much difficulty, but he could not understand what the child was saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just when he thought he could not communicate with the child, the child gave him another surprise. He had no idea that the child could write.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not just write simple words either like &lsquo;one&rsquo;, &lsquo;two&rsquo;, or &lsquo;three&rsquo;. He could write more complex words and could write to express something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not help but marvel at the little boy, and at the same time, felt sorry for him. After all, he was such a bright child but was born with a disability.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he helped the child to look for the cochlear implant in the bathroom. Sure enough, he found the missing cochlear implant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was startled by the happy smile on the child's face when he was holding the cochlear implant. The smile made him think of someone in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He even found it ridiculous to think of that woman from seeing a child's smile! The woman... He had been looking for all these years but failed to find.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought it would be easy for him to find her after she got out of prison, but he could not find her whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was surprised. He did not expect that one of the people who brought the child here today was Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, another voice rang, "Why are you still here, Wenming?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss turned around and smiled at the woman approaching, saying, "Something happened, but I sorted it out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had mixed feelings as she looked at the woman in front of her who was undoubtedly beautiful. She was in a light beige gown and was wearing crystal-studded high heels. Her long straight hair hung down freely, looking lovely against her palm-sized face. Her appearance inspired men to be protective of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace remembered seeing the woman's face from the case files and the news she had seen. It was because of this woman that Kyla was sentenced to prison in the first place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This woman was now Martin Weiss's fianc&eacute;e, Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she found out about Kyla's relationship with Martin Weiss, she deliberately searched about Martin Weiss on the internet. It was widely rumored on the internet that Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels would get married soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bore Martin Weiss a child and was sentenced to prison on his testimony, yet now the man was about to marry another woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla must have seen the news too. She wondered how Kyla felt when she read the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels went over to Martin Weiss and grabbed his arm lovingly. Then, she looked at Grace, Jason, and Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is Mr. Reed and his girlfriend Grace," introduced Martin Weiss.</p></div>
