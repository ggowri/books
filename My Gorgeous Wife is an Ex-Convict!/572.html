        <h1>Chapter 571</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... it did not make sense. Master Hart was Evelyn's boyfriend, and she was now trying to seek justice for Evelyn. If Master Hart did not like people, he should dislike Evelyn's older sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian walked forward, but before he could speak, the manager eagerly said, "Master Hart, Evelyn only wanted to take her sister to Howell Webb out of kindness. However, her sister pushed her away and made Evelyn sprain her foot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, she was suggesting that Brian was backing Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's eyes were misty, and she looked delicate. It was as if she were trying to hold back her tears. "Brian... Don't&hellip; Don't listen to her. Sis&hellip; didn't mean it. I fell because I lost my footing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the more she said it like that, the more she directed the focus onto Grace; it only made people feel that her older sister was arrogant and domineering. Additionally, it made people feel that the little sister was the one that had been wronged and was suffering silently as her sister bullied her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn wanted to use her fans and the public&rsquo;s opinion to step on Grace. Besides, no one would be able to find anything wrong with her and even Jason would not have a reason to stand up for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn secretly thought that she now looked like someone who could stand what had been done to her and was kind enough to speak up for her perpetrator, Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, Brian's eyes only grew colder. His keen eyes looked straight at Evelyn, so much so that the latter felt as if she had no place to hide and that this man knew all her ideas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she was his girlfriend, she always felt that there was an insurmountable gap between him and her. Additionally, she had tried hard to get close to him, but he refused to let her do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's thin lips parted, and he said in a cold voice, "You fell because you didn't watch your footing." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words were like an invisible slap, forcefully slapping Evelyn's face!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but visualize the scene that night when she had watched him hold Grace in his arms in front of the small restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if... Brian did not know that Grace was the little girl, was he still attracted to Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As for her..." Brian pointed again at the manager who had scolded Grace. "I don't think she needs to work here anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager looked shocked. Had she... been fired by Master Hart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager broke out in a cold sweat. Being fired by the entertainment industry's crown prince in person meant that she could forget about working in the industry. No company would accept her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She... She had only taken it out for Evelyn! She had only been trying to please Evelyn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager looked at Evelyn for help, but how could Evelyn help her? Brian's eyes were so cold they seemed to be able to read people's hearts, making her tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned to look at Grace. "Are you all right?" There was a touch of rare concern in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine," Grace replied lightly. Then she said to Howell Webb's assistant who was still in a trance beside her, "Can we go now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, of course... of course we can," the assistant replied hurriedly and continued leading the way. Grace dragged Lina who was now guilty and followed the assistant toward Howell Webb's lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Behind them, Evelyn lowered her eyes; she did so to hide the look of hatred she had in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian... went as far as to criticize her in public for Grace. 'What was so good about Grace?' She had to make sure that Grace lost access to several opportunities!</p></div>
