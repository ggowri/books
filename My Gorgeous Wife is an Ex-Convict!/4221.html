        <h1>Chapter 4219</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The doctor rushed over and administered a sedative to Tina after giving her a preliminary diagnosis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, Tina's headache subsided and she fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Doctor, what is happening?" Lina asked, her eyes turning red with worry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that something triggered her memory, causing the headache," the doctor answered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The three of them were taken aback, and Lina quickly asked, "Does that mean Tina might recover her memory?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's possible. Her memory loss was originally traumatic, so when she encounters something that triggers her memory, there is a chance for recovery. However, the side effect could be a headache like she experienced earlier," the doctor replied. "Of course, there are also some patients who never recover their memory and instead develop a headache disorder. So, whether or not memory recovery is possible sometimes just comes down to luck."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, it's difficult to restore memory through treatment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether or not recovery is possible largely depends on luck.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the doctor left, Chandler sat by the bedside, looking at Tina lying on the hospital bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Will she recover her memory? How wonderful would it be if Tina could regain her memory just like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They could go back to how they were before, and she wouldn't only be thinking about Kit anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Tina woke up again and looked at him with her eyes, an indescribable disappointment welled up in Chandler's heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that she hadn't regained her memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because the love she used to have for him was absent in her gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're awake. How do you feel? Is your headache still there?" Chandler suppressed his disappointment and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina paused for a moment and then said, "If you claim to be the father of the child, then tell me, why is this child so important to me? Do you know the reason? What does this child mean to me? Is it really just because I am her mother, or is there another reason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler was momentarily stunned, staring blankly at Tina in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she hadn't regained her memory, she still remembered the child, subconsciously aware of her importance to the child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I say that you care about this child, partly because of me, would you believe it?" Chandler's voice was hoarse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina hesitated, "Because of you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because of me..." He pursed his lips, his nose tingling. "I have a disease that requires the placenta of you and our child to treat. So, you care more about this child because you are her mother, and at the same time, you hope I can cure my illness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina seemed to hear something unbelievable, "Your illness requires the placenta?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." It was the curse of the Hunter family, a fate he couldn't escape since birth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, in the past, he resented the heavens for giving him such a fate, but later, he was grateful to the heavens for giving him such a fate because it led him to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, is there still a placenta now?" Tina asked with difficulty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never expected that the placenta could actually treat the man in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the child was premature, and she didn't even know if there was a placenta.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's gone," Chandler said. The placenta had already been treated as medical waste and disposed of.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when he arrived at the hospital, he didn't even ask about the placenta. He was only concerned about her well-being.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until they were about to transfer her to another hospital that the people from the Hunter family came over and informed him that the placenta had been disposed of and couldn't be retrieved!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elders of the Hunter family were naturally anxious about this, but they also knew that it was already impossible to reverse the situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He can only make Tina get pregnant again as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he naturally won't comply with this request from the Hunter family elders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only cares about whether Tina's body can recover. As for the placenta and his illness, he doesn't care anymore.</span></p></div>
