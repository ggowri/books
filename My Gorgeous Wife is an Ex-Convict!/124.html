        <h1>Chapter 123</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Grace had washed up, Jason carried her back to bed, and she saw that her meal had been served.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although it was a simple meal consisting of porridge and some other dishes, it looked appetizing. Grace's tummy suddenly growled loudly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The doctor recommended making you eat food that's easy to digest," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He then started to put the dishes on the overbed table for her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If anyone had witnessed the scene, their eyes would have popped out of their heads. Mr. Reed, the man who called the shots in Emerald City, was attending to a woman.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace took the utensils and started eating her food. When she lowered her head to eat, her long hair kept falling down her face, almost getting into the porridge.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as she was about to look for a hairband to tie up her hair with, Jason showed that he was one step ahead of her and said, "Let me do it." As he spoke, he took out a hairband and a comb that had been put to one side.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Grace saw the logo on the hairband, she knew that it was branded. Before she had been imprisoned, she had bought a few hair accessories carrying this brand as her income had allowed her to do so back then.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had not expected Jay to be so attentive to have prepared such a trivial thing.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you know how to do it?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I've seen you do it every day, so it's no problem," Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He took the comb and started combing her hair before tying it up. Although he was not skillful, he did a good job.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, someone knocked on the door.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Come in," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the door opened, Terrence walked in. He was stunned when he saw the scene.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is Mr. Reed... combing a woman's hair for her?!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Reed had never paid any attention to the women who had flung themselves at him, let alone combed their hair for them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, he seemed willing to do anything for Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was surprised by Jay's actions. When she came to her senses after seeing Terrence's expression, she realized that Jay was combing her hair!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She felt embarrassed instantly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's up?" Jason asked, continuing to comb her hair gently.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's..." Terrence paused for a while and did not go on.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Jason saw this, he knew that his words were not meant for Grace's ears. After combing her hair, Jason said, "Sis, enjoy your meal. I'm going out for a while."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After they had gotten out of the ward, Terrence said, "The security guard caught a reporter trying to sneak in. The reporter found out that Miss Cummins had been admitted to the hospital so he came to look for news to report."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason squinted his eyes and asked, "Is he looking for a scoop? How did he find out that Grace had been admitted to this hospital?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"He mentioned that someone posted on social media about you carrying Miss Cummins to this hospital last night, so he came to dig for information," Terrence replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Jason heard this, he asked coldly, "Was he trying to dig up news about me or Grace?"</p></div>
