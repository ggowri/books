        <h1>Chapter 3222</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The group of girls in the audience all felt a pang of regret when they heard Brian mention his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, do you like anime?" the host asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It wasn't anything special to begin with, and I didn't particularly like it. However, my wife is a big fan, so under her influence, I gradually grew to like it too," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The girls in the audience immediately began to whisper and wonder what kind of woman this "wife" really was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The competition is divided into two aspects: "civil" and "martial". In terms of "civil", it naturally refers to answering questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The host's questions were all about anime, some of which only experienced anime fans could answer. Even Valda in the audience had to think for a while to answer some of the questions, and there were even some that she couldn't answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, what surprised Valda was that Brian was able to answer almost all of the questions, except for two that he didn't answer. He was the first to start writing and finished answering almost all of the questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the host was a bit skeptical and couldn't help but ask, "Are you really influenced by your wife and like anime? Then... may I ask how long you have liked it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not even three years yet," Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The host said, 'Mr. Hart, you're really amazing to be able to answer so many questions. You must have watched a lot of anime works.'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian replied calmly, "Yes, quite a few."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was surprised. She didn't know that. Usually when they were together, even if he watched anime works, he would just come over and take a look when she was watching. The number of works he watched shouldn't be too many!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, among these questions, some anime works she had watched, but not with him. She watched them alone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the quiz section, there were some sports events, such as live darts and ring toss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian usually did well at the beginning, but in the last few rounds, he would make mistakes, causing others to catch up with his score.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people felt sorry for Brian, but Valda realized that he did it on purpose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He deliberately made mistakes to keep his total score in third place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And when the competition ended, Brian did indeed win the third prize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until now that someone finally realized what he had done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? Could it be that he did it on purpose? Just to win this third place prize?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh my god, if this was intentional, then his calculations are just too accurate. Not only does he have to calculate his own score, but he also has to calculate the scores of others!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wow, his wife is so lucky."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I also really want to have a husband like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a moment, there was a lot of discussion, which made Valda feel a bit embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian approached Valda with the prize in hand, her face turned red and all she could see was him smiling at her and saying, "Alright, we got the book, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The smile at the corner of his lips softens his aloofness and indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm," Valda responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until the two of them walked away that someone realized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Was that person just now his wife?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He smiled so tenderly at his wife!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But his wife looks average, and when she walked just now, she seemed to limp a bit! Could it be that his wife is some rich person and he's just a gigolo?" Some people started maliciously speculating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But immediately after, another voice contradicted it.</p></div>
