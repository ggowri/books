        <h1>Chapter 2184</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hacked?" Philip Barlow was quick to filter through his competitors in the business world who were likely to go against him. "What about now? When will it be restored?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm afraid it's going to take some time, but the backup power supply is now on. The house will soon have power again," his subordinate said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sure enough, the lights in the residence were switched back on after a while. Philip Barlow pondered for a moment. Suddenly, he seemed to recall something and dialed Jason's number before asking, "Jason, your son seems to have good computer skills, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, Mick Reed's forte was also written in the information he received when he investigated the Reed family before this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he had just flipped through the information without thinking much about it. After all, even if a child had good computer skills, how good could they be? Now... he needed to give it some thought. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the call got through, Philip Barlow asked, "Tell me, how did your son and daughter leave the hotel? Doesn&rsquo;t the hotel have surveillance? Did the security guards not notice two kids walking out of the hotel without an adult?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason did not hide any information and said that his son had hacked into the hotel's surveillance system.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow's speculation was immediately confirmed once he heard this. He gave a long sigh. "It seems your son and daughter have arrived at my place. Your son hacked into my security system."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was true that the longer one lived, the more one would see!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">While the two little ones were still exploring Barlow Residence, Mick Reed found the map of the residence's layout in the security system. He asked his sister to memorize it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper had always had a good memory and soon memorized it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"They're trying to counter the intrusion, so I need to find a place to delay them. Otherwise, they'll find us when the surveillance comes back on. You should go find William," Mick Reed said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay!" Jasper answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Mick Reed found a place in the bushes outside the main house and began countering the Barlow family's computer experts, while Jasper crept into the main house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There were few servants in the main house at this hour. Jasper easily avoided them and moved up to the second floor because she had memorized the location of each room in the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'William must be sleeping in his room now. I only have to go to William's room to see him!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had so many things to say to him. Although she had her eldest brother accompanying her to sleep these days, she still wanted to sleep with William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, she suddenly heard someone yell, "Little Young Master!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She subconsciously hid in a corner nearby. She looked over and saw William dressed in blue pajamas as he stood anxiously in front of a maid in uniform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where is the doll I always keep by the bed? Where is it?" William asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The maid was surprised to see the child looking so anxious. Since the young master came to the Barlow family, he rarely showed any emotions and usually seemed well-behaved and calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could abide by the etiquette perfectly, and he never fell behind in his study. Many teachers had praised him, making Old Master and Old Madam smile from ear to ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it was the first time the maid had seen the little young master look so anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Old Madam said the doll is a girl's toy, and you shouldn&rsquo;t play with it, Little Young Master. Besides, the doll is old. You can tell Old Madam if you're interested in any other toys," the maid answered without delay.</p></div>
