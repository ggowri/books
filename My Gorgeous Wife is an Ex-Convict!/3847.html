        <h1>Chapter 3845</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was discharged from the hospital, and Veronica moved in with the Reed family to take care of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Reed family was happy to see their relationship develop, and even Grace would chat with Veronica about when they planned to get married and whether they would live in the Reed family or buy a villa outside after marriage, making Veronica blush.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, living with the Reed family during this time made her feel a kind of relaxation that she had never experienced before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because she had completely recognized her feelings for Mason, and the misunderstandings between them had been resolved. She even had hope for the future, so all the negative emotions that had weighed on her in the past had dissipated one by one.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there were still any worries, one was about Daniel's trial in court, and the other was about her own family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was well aware of her father and stepmother's greed, and although her half-brother's nature was still kind, he had been spoiled by her father and stepmother, spending money recklessly and even developing a lifetime of bad habits. If this continued, even his inherent kindness would be erased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although her father and stepmother didn't know about her and Mason's reconciliation yet, if they found out, they would probably come to the Reed family to ask for benefits again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of her parasitic father and stepmother, Veronica couldn't help but feel </span><span>disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She despised her own family and even felt inferior when she saw the Reed family's happy scene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you thinking about?" Mason asked Veronica, who was lost in thought, in the Reed family's garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're together now, but I'm worried that my family will make excessive demands if they find out," Veronica replied truthfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of contemplation, Mason said, "Even if they do make excessive demands, the Reed family can fulfill them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was well aware of her family's character - greedy and insatiable - but any problem that money could solve was not a big deal for the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But I don't want that," Veronica said. "If we keep satisfying them, they'll never be content and will only become more demanding!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like before, her father and stepmother used Mason to gain benefits from the Reed family. In the future, would she become the next object of her father and stepmother's exploitation?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want to be used like that and didn't want to end up hating herself in the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, I want to cut ties with them!" Veronica said, as if she had made up her mind. In fact, before this, she had already cut off almost all contact with her father and stepmother, except...sometimes they would come to her for trouble because of money issues and hope she could speak to the Reed family for them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was taken aback, clearly surprised by her words.</span></p></div>
