        <h1>Chapter 2015</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William, what's the matter?" Jasper Reed's child-like voice rang in William's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He came back to his senses and quickly looked at the person in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did you hear what I told you?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"My birthday is only a week away. You mustn't forget to give me a present!" The little one asked for a present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"A present?" He froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No present?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William instantly felt a pang of guilt when her beautiful almond-shaped eyes blinked, looking disappointed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if it would be a heinous crime if he did not give her a birthday present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What... What present do you want?" he asked in a stammer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can only make it a surprise if I don't know what you&rsquo;re getting me. When the time comes, you have to give it to me in front of everyone!" she spoke like a small grown-up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could not help smiling as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked blankly at her smile. There was... no way he could give her a present in front of everyone because he could not even attend her birthday party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, his mouth could not help saying &lsquo;okay&rsquo; because he did not want to see her smile turn into disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper rolled up her small blanket in content and soon fell asleep beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William was awake. With his clear eyes wide open, he looked at Jasper Reed's sweet sleeping face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">How he wished he could go to her birthday party and give her the present in front of everyone as she wanted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her present... haunted William's mind, but he had no idea what to give her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not have any money. The Reed family provided him with all the food and necessary things. Even if he wanted to give her a paper crane as a present, the paper would come from the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">During his lunch break, he snuck out of the kindergarten without the guards noticing. He wanted to see what he could buy for Jasper on the streets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, all the things he saw cost money. There was no way he could buy them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Will I be able to buy Jasper a present if I have money?' His little hand clutched the piece of paper tightly as he thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'The man I'm supposed to call my daddy sounds like a rich man. Will the man give me money if I ask for it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, what the little one did not know was that Philip Barlow was looking at him through the window of a black car parked nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one looked up and said something to a woman passing by. Then, she took out her phone, took the paper from the little one's hand, and made a call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Soon, Philip Barlow's phone started ringing in his hand and a woman's voice sounded. "Hello, Sir. Your son is alone on the street. He asked me to call this number and ask you to come here and pick him up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The woman gave him the location, and the little one's melodious voice rang out. "Daddy, I'm William. Could you come and get me?"</p></div>
