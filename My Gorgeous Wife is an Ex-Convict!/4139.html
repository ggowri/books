        <h1>Chapter 4137</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You can't hold your liquor, let me do it!" Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he spoke, he took the glass from Tina's hand and drank it all in one gulp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina stared at Chandler, who had finished his drink. Did Chandler just help Kit by drinking for him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, the room fell silent. Even Mr. Perkins, who initially wanted Kit to drink three glasses, felt a moment of awkwardness. Fortunately, someone quickly tried to liven up the atmosphere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit, realizing that the conversation had shifted away from him, quietly left his seat and headed to the restroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He hadn't eaten much since last night, and he had consumed quite a bit of alcohol during the dinner. His stomach felt like a whirlpool at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leaning over the toilet in the restroom, Kit began to vomit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, since he hadn't eaten much in the first place, he didn't vomit much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After he finished vomiting, he wearily walked over to the sink, rinsed his mouth, carefully wiped the corners of his lips, and then tidied up his appearance in front of the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Today's dinner was arranged by his father, solely to impress these big shots and gain access to better resources.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although he felt disgusted inside, he couldn't resist his father's arrangements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just endure a little longer... Endure until the day he can completely break free from his father! Kit said to himself in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the mirror, he appeared delicate and handsome. It was this face that made others like him and brought him more advantages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If he didn't have this face, perhaps even if he was his father's illegitimate child with a blood relationship, his father wouldn't have taken him out of the orphanage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn't need to care about Tina. As long as he pretended she didn't exist, today's dinner would be no different from previous ones!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, as he walked out of the restroom, his footsteps abruptly halted because Tina was standing right at the restroom entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And from the way she looks, it's obvious she's waiting for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because as soon as she saw him come out, her eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You finally came out!" Tina breathed a sigh of relief. "If you didn't come out, I was about to go into the men's restroom to find you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Miss Stephenson, do you need something from me?" Kit said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina frowned. "Didn't we already address each other by our names earlier?" The sudden use of "Miss Stephenson" made her feel a bit strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit's lashes trembled slightly, and he lowered his gaze. "Alright, Tina, what do you need from me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Were you vomiting in there just now?" she asked. She heard faint sounds of vomiting coming from inside. "When I saw you leave the private room, your complexion was really bad. Was it because of yesterday in the elevator, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm fine," he interrupted her. "Thank you for your concern, but I really have no issues."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I see," Tina hesitated for a moment. "Then don't drink anymore when you go back into the private room later. Your face is as pale as a sheet of paper now. If you feel uncomfortable later, just blink at me and I'll find a way for you to leave early."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why are you being so kind to me?" Kit suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Huh?" Tina was taken aback. "Because you like the idol, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit bitterly smiled in his heart. Yes, isn't that the obvious answer? But what was he hoping for?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was he expecting a different answer?</p></div>
