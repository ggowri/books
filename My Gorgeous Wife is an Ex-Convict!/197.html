        <h1>Chapter 196</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The men of the Reed family should never fall in love with a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Master Reed's face was contorted with anger. This was obviously bad for a man who had just been rescued from death only two days before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason did not want to appease the old man. Instead, he said lightly, "Grandfather, since I&rsquo;ve already said so to your face today, then it means that I can definitely protect her. The doctor has already said, if you take care of your body well, you might get to live for a few more years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Master Reed seemed to laugh in anger. "Alright, it&rsquo;s no wonder you're my grandson. It seems that you really have feelings for that woman. Have you forgotten your father's example? Are you going to follow in your father's footsteps?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if I do love a woman, I won&rsquo;t let that woman run my life," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your father said the same thing at the beginning, but look at what happened! He lost his life for a woman!" Master Reed said mockingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not him!" Jason said coldly. He slowly got up and walked in front of the old man. He then leaned down. Those deep black eyes looked straight at Master Reed. "Grandfather, I'm not my father. Don't you confuse us two!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two pairs of eyes met each other. The air was once again filled with tension. There was even a faint sense of something impending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Eventually, Master Reed's voice broke the silence. "Does that mean you're going to marry her too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why not?" Jason said. He would eventually marry a woman into the Reed family. Before this, he had no opinion about who he would marry. It was just a matter of finding a mother for the future successor of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he felt that if he wanted to be with a woman for the rest of his life, Grace would be a good choice. At least he would not feel bored looking at her, and he even enjoyed being with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would have the urge to want her as well as hide her and lock her up so that no one else could see her smile and gentleness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This side of him had never existed for any other woman before. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was more, he seemed unable to accept her marrying another man. The thought of her belonging to another man would cause a feeling called &lsquo;jealousy&rsquo; to spread through his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it?" Master Reed did not get angry after hearing this. "I've investigated it. It seems that this woman named Grace knows about your identity, but she is still living in a peasant's house. It looks like she may not be willing to marry you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It'll only be a matter of time when I decide if I really want her to marry me." Jason smiled gently. His eyes revealed a look of high aspirations. "Grandfather, if I want a woman, then that woman must be willing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Willing indeed!" Master Reed coughed again, then grabbed a stack of documents on his bedside table. He threw it toward Jason with all his might. "Do you think she will be willing to be with you after uncovering all these things from the past?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sheets of paper spilled across the entire floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason bent down to pick up a few and examined them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If she finds out that the accident was just a power struggle that you played a part in and that she was only a poor victim, do you think she will still have the so-called willingness to be with you?" Master Reed asked with a stern voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile on Jason's face disappeared gradually. His handsome face was filled with cold seriousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I never thought that Grandfather would manage to find out all these."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You didn't care about it before, so you didn't think of hiding anything," Master Reed said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, it&rsquo;s my fault for being careless." Jason seemed to admit his mistakes humbly.</p></div>
