        <h1>Chapter 534</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's all right, then. The premiere is at five o 'clock in the afternoon. We can still go to the premiere after his class is over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, can we?" Grace looked surprised, not expecting to be able to go to the premiere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why not?" He could not help laughing and said, "If it's too late, I can organize you another premiere if you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. Organizing another premiere for her alone was... Was just too much. However, come to think of it, if it was Jason, it was nothing for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she did not really want Jason to go through all the trouble to organize another premiere for her, her heart was flooded with some kind of sweetness because of his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was the kind of sweetness you felt when you were being cherished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car reached its destination, Grace led Nelson out of the car by the hand. Jason followed Grace as they took Nelson to his classroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were many children with cochlear implants here, and their parents led them into the classroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason thought they just had to leave the child in the classroom and hand him over to the teacher, but Grace sat down directly beside Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The classes here need help and cooperation from the parents. Why don't you just hang out outside? I'll call you when class is over," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together a little, pulled up a chair, and sat down beside the little one. "In that case, I'll stay too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although it was Grace and Jason's first time coming here, the other parents knew Nelson, so they looked at Grace and Jason in confusion. After all, they were not the ones bringing Nelson to class before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, in particular, exuded an imposing aura and looked so good that it was hard not to notice him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The parent of a child sitting in front of Nelson could not help asking, "Why didn't Nelson's mother accompany him to class today? You&rsquo;re..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm Nelson's aunt," answered Grace. Nelson had always called her Aunty anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then this is..." The parent turned to look at Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was hard not to notice a man like this. He was simply sitting there, but it was as if there was a spotlight on him that made people unable to take their eyes off him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was more eye-catching than those supermodels and celebrities on stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's..." Grace pursed her lips, and her eyes met Jason's&mdash;he looked like he was waiting for her answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's my boyfriend." Grace put it out there. This was Grace's first time introducing Jason to a stranger this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she said that, a light flickered in his bright amorous eyes as he smiled.</p></div>
