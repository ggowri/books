        <h1>Chapter 1019</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The injustice of her imprisonment and the sufferings she endured in prison would have destroyed any ordinary person's spirit and will.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was still holding on, working hard for her survival and future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though her life had been derailed by a miscarriage of justice, she was starting over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman seemed weak and delicate but was far more tenacious than ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She reminded him of the little girl from his childhood... Sometimes, he could not help thinking that if only that little girl had been her instead of Stella!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finding Stella only made him realize that sometimes, imagination was different from reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little girl was once full of a sense of justice and a desire to see justice done, but now, Stella only wanted to live a life of luxury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it did not matter. Since Stella was his savior, he could give her the life she wanted as long as it was not too demanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian got up. He walked out of the study and into the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Stella saw Brian, she immediately said hesitantly, "Brian, I came to see you today because I wanted to tell you something, but... I don't know if I should tell you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Stella with a cold stare. There was something wrong with the way she was speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To put it bluntly, she wanted to talk about something and this move was just to show that she was doing it for his benefit, not out of malice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such a move was of course the oldest trick in the book to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Usually, he did not mind if a woman tried some tricks on him. He would only see it as a joke, but... he was disappointed to see Stella do the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now that you're here, just tell me whatever you have to say," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Joy flashed across Stella's face, but then her expression changed to one of distress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pulled out a recorder pen and said, "This is a conversation Grace and I had the other day. I accidentally hit the record button, so I recorded a part of the conversation. I... didn't want to say anything, but I was afraid you might get hurt, so I came anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Instead of taking the recorder pen, Brian stared at Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella got a little guilty and said dryly, "Why don't I&hellip; play it for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without waiting for Brian to answer, she pressed the play button. The conversation she had with Grace was played, but she had edited the recording and deleted all parts that were unfavorable to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace&rsquo;s voice could be heard saying &ldquo;I don't love Brian, and I don't have any ideas about him", Stella observed Brian's expression. She was hoping to see anger or some traces that showed his love for her was turning into hate on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she ended up being disappointed as Brian's expression remained the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian remained unconcerned until the recording ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella even wanted to play the recording again for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I accidentally recorded it. Brian, as you heard, Grace doesn't love you. I'm worried that you might get hurt, especially now that Grace's life isn't going so well. I'm afraid that she&rsquo;ll only date you to change her life and your feelings would then go to waste," Stella said with an air of concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just like how your life wasn't going well until I found you, right? Didn't your life change because of me?" said Brian.</p></div>
