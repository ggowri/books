        <h1>Chapter 3947</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy estimated that Mick might have to discuss business with the other party, so she said, "I'll leave first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need," said Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, the sound of knocking on the door was heard, and a middle-aged man pushed the door and walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the other party saw Nancy in the office, he was obviously stunned and hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just say what you need to say," said Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Manager Lanley's eyes flashed with surprise, but he didn't care about Nancy anymore and directly reported the work-related matters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy listened on the side, and it was about some problems with a new game that was currently being developed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy also played games herself, and even took a course on game programming for a while, so she understood some of the problems mentioned by Manager Lanley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Listening to the conversation between Manager Lanley and Mick about work, Nancy was not bored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Manager Lanley finished talking and left the office, Nancy asked, "Is it okay for me to hear those things just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think it matters?" Mick asked back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...the content of your conversation was about an unreleased game, which should be confidential," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As far as she knew, big companies like Reed Group would try to find out the content of their games in advance, so employees had to sign confidentiality agreements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, just now, they were discussing it in front of her as if they had no concerns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it can't be leaked," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aren't you afraid that I might leak something?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why should I be afraid?" he casually asked back, "If this information were to be known by the outside world, it's you who should be afraid. Do you think selling the news about the Reed Group to outsiders will end well for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy shuddered, okay, he was right!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As far as the rumors about the Reed family in Emerald City were concerned, anyone who dared to betray the Reed family would definitely not end well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, I won't leak anything," Nancy assured stiffly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need to be afraid," Mick may have noticed her nervousness, stood up and walked over to her, "As long as you don't cheat me or do anything to betray me, nothing will happen. Even if you get into trouble, I will protect you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There are probably not many people in Emerald City who can make Mick say the word "protect."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If others were to get this promise, they would probably be ecstatic. After all, anyone the Reed family wants to protect can be protected. This is like getting a get-out-of-jail-free card in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But after hearing this, Nancy was more uneasy than relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Betrayal...she shouldn't do anything to betray Mick, but deception...if one day he found out that her so-called liking for him was just to use him to help her mother seek justice and bring down the Schultz family, what would he think?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Would that be a betrayal to him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong, don't you believe me?" Mick mistook Nancy's silence for disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I believe you," Nancy replied, "It's just...um, you're so straightforward in saying you'll protect me. Aren't you afraid you said it too early in case I really do something big in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since I said it, there's nothing to be afraid of," Mick said, "I said I'll protect you, so I will."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if in the future...I deceive you, betray you, would you still protect me?" Nancy hesitated and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's eyes suddenly deepened, "Would you?"</p></div>
