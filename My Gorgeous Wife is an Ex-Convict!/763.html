        <h1>Chapter 762</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not expect her to be here and encounter that thrilling scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw her fall off the cliff, his mind was almost blank. He just instinctively rushed over and grabbed her wrist, forgetting that he might fall with her if he made any mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she could not reach him with her other hand and was even suffering a headache, he panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid that his hand could not grab onto hers and that she would eventually fall. Plus, she was having a headache as well. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been scared to death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed like it had been a long, long time since he experienced such fear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even as he pulled her up when she was in a semi-coma, there was already a cold sweat on his back. His hands were shaking too. The fear was spreading rapidly throughout his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time he came to himself, he was already holding her tightly in his arms as if he was holding an important treasure. He simply would not let go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why... Why is this happening? Why do I care so much about her when I know she isn&rsquo;t the one?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked down at the unconscious Grace and ran his hand gently over her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I must have fallen for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I have indeed fallen for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Maybe I already fell for her the first time I saw her, but then... I didn't take it seriously and wasn&rsquo;t willing to confront Jason for a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, now that she has become Jason's woman, I... Will no longer mistake my feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Everything ends here!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, this is the first time and the last time I'll give my life to save you. It won't happen again. I won't feel the slightest affection for you from now on," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rather than talking to her while she was unconscious, it was more like he was telling himself that while he was sober.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the future, she would be Jason's woman. His pride forbade himself to fall for a woman who had her heart set on another man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he needed to retrieve his feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He carried her while she was still unconscious on his back, just like how the little girl had carried him down the hill when he was little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After telling Grace that he would not abandon her here, Brian stopped talking and just continued to carry Grace on his back down the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the two of them did not know that all hell had broken loose at the foot of the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face darkened as he dialed Grace's phone only to hear the system tone saying that no one was answering the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver stood trembling, his face pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's alright if Miss Cummins could come back safely in a moment. But if anything did happen, Young Master Reed would probably never let me live in peace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Where the hell is Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at the rolling hills in front of him with a pale face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he arrived at the Lu family's house, Grace had not gone back yet. He called her but could not get through. He asked the driver who accompanied Grace here and found out that she went up the hill to pay her respects but had not come down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were traces of worship at her grandmother's grave, but they could not find her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Reed, perhaps Miss Cummins was held up by something else. Perhaps she'll appear in a moment," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together tightly, his right hand clutching his phone as he stared silently at the hills.</p></div>
