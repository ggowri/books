        <h1>Chapter 1933</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina packed up everything and was about to book a taxi to pick her up with her phone when the security guard at the gate stopped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Miss, Mr. Stephenson wants to see you. You can go in now." The security guard's voice and expression were far more respectful now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze slightly. Then, surprise and joy flashed across her face. 'Hadwin wants to see me? I can finally talk to him and beg for his forgiveness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But... will he ever forgive me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She once again thought of Hadwin Stephenson&rsquo;s reaction at Stephenson Group's entrance. She quickly shook her head and told herself not to overthink. What mattered most now was that... she could see him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina entered the Stephenson family's mansion, and a maid led her into the living room. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The vast hall was magnificent but somehow gave off a chill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was standing in the middle of the living room with his handsome face full of indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Everyone, get out. No one can come in without my permission," Hadwin Stephenson ordered coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All the maids who were in the room went out. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Suddenly, only Lina and Hadwin Stephenson were left in the large room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina stared at Hadwin Stephenson almost greedily. She did not have time to take a good look at him when they were outside Stephenson Group earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Am I that good-looking that you can't look away?" Hadwin Stephenson's voice broke the silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes. Yes, you're very good-looking," Lina could not help blurting out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's brows instantly furrowed. "Lina, I didn't let you in to hear you talk nonsense. Didn't you say you had something to say to me? Okay, go ahead. I'll listen!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said as he walked over to the couch nearby and sat down nonchalantly. He gracefully crossed his legs. The way he looked at her made her feel as if she was facing the presiding judge of a court.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina&rsquo;s mind went blank at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'"If you have nothing to say, then leave at once and never appear before me again!" said Hadwin Stephenson. As long as she did not appear, he would not be upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said almost subconsciously, "Hadwin, I love you. I really do!" She did not want to leave! She had so much more to say!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You love me?" He sneered, and his eyes turned colder. "Lina, how dare you say these three words? If you love me, you wouldn't have said that you want nothing to do with me and even abort the baby when I tried so hard to keep you by my side. Lina, if you love me, how could you not give me a chance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His questions made her heart ache. "I... I do love you. I... I know I was selfish. I was so selfish because I didn't want to get hurt. But Hadwin, you&rsquo;re the only one I've ever loved all these years. You're the only one! I misunderstood you. It's my fault!"</p></div>
