        <h1>Chapter 3663</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper let out a sigh in her heart, but she understood that everyone is different. Besides, her mother had once said that Mason was the most difficult one among the triplets when they were young. Her older brother followed their father, she followed </span><span>their mother, and they both had the company of their family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But only Mason didn't have the company of his family when he was young. Instead, he was taken by bad people and trained like a machine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That person even taught young Mason the cruel principle of survival of the fittest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Growing up like this, Mason naturally didn't have the same emotions as her and her older brother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper suddenly stepped forward and hugged Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's body stiffened, but he didn't avoid the hug. Instead, he lowered his head in confusion and asked, "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just suddenly wanted to hug you like this," Jasper said. "Mason, we are family. Even if you think emotions are troublesome, you must never forget that we are family. No matter what you encounter, me, Dad, Mom, older brother, and little sister will always be your support!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason gently lowered his eyelids. Family... Even though he used to think that the emotions between family members were useless, he seemed to gradually care about this feeling unconsciously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because they had a blood bond between them?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of this blood relationship, was this kind of family relationship unbreakable?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Another delicate face flashed through his mind. There was also someone who had once told him that they would accompany him for a lifetime and be the family member who loved him the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he and that person were like two intersecting lines. Even though they had briefly crossed paths, they would eventually drift further and further apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jasper went back to school, many classmates asked her about Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, they were only asking whether Mason had a girlfriend or what kind of women he liked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper only just found out that during her absence, Mason had caused quite a stir at school. These days, many girls at Stanford University were flocking to the finance department. Any elective courses chosen by Mason were sure to be fully booked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thanks to Mason, Jasper and William's popularity on campus had decreased significantly and they were no longer the focus of everyone's attention.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After learning this fact, Jasper felt deeply grateful to Mason in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does your brother Mason really not have a girlfriend?" After class, Jasper and the other three roommates walked towards their dormitory, and Meave asked along the way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, he doesn't," Jasper said. "Mason is very indifferent to matters of the heart. People like him are not easily moved emotionally."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But the more this kind of person is, the more the world will shake if they do fall in love," Horea said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, yes! That's how it's portrayed in TV dramas," Nina chimed in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper thought of the situation between Veronica and Mason, and it seemed to be true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Meave suddenly stopped in her tracks. "Hey, Jasper, isn't that Mason over there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meave pointed to a spot not far ahead of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked over and sure enough, it was Mason!</span></p></div>
