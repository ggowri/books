        <h1>Chapter 3768</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The voices of the conversation gradually faded away, and the two people should have walked away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper breathed a sigh of relief in his heart, then raised his hand and slapped Lawrence hard across the face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The slap made Lawrence's face turn to the side, and a clear red mark appeared on his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've gone too far!" Jasper glared at Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Gone too far?" Lawrence turned his head and stared at the person in front of him again. "Who is the one who really went too far?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know I did something wrong in the past, and I'm sorry for that. I've been trying to make it up to you. You can choose to forgive me or not, but that doesn't mean you have the right to do this to me!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't have the right? Then William does, right?" he said with a nasty tone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course he does, he's my boyfriend!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her words seemed to anger him even more, causing him to grip her shoulders tightly. "Just because he's the son of the Barlow family? If he wasn't, if he was just a child of a criminal with nothing, and his mother had even committed an unforgivable sin against your mother, would you still let him be your boyfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've said before that the grudges of the previous generation are the business of the previous generation. My parents have never wanted to pass on the grudges of the previous generation to me!" Jasper said seriously. "So who William's mother is and what she has done won't stop me from liking him. Even if he has nothing, my answer is still the same."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a touching speech. I wonder if William would be moved to tears if he heard you say that," Lawrence mocked. "But you've only been dating him for a short time. Are you sure you'll always like him? Are you sure you'll never change your mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper remained silent. It was easy to say "yes" to being sure, but no one can predict the future. She was used to William's company and enjoyed doing intimate things with him, which made her feel very moved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, she and William had only just started dating, so she was still figuring out her feelings for this kind of romantic relationship and trying to understand what place </span><span>William held in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why aren't you saying anything? You can't be sure that you'll never change your mind, can you?" Lawrence said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The word 'forever' shouldn't be used lightly," Jasper said. "I like William, I've liked him for many years, that's why I'm dating him. I want to take it further, to like him more, to understand him, to see if we have the possibility of growing old together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice was calm and even a little flat, but it only made the anger in his heart grow stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grow old together?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wants to grow old with William? They can be happy for a lifetime?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then what about him? What kind of miserable life will he have?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You said you wanted to compensate me, was that sincere?" Lawrence suddenly said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course it was," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll give you a way to compensate me. If you can do it, I won't hate you or the Reed family anymore from now on," he said.</span></p></div>
