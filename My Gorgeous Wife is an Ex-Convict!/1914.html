        <h1>Chapter 1912</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The pain of having your wound clawed like this was far worse than being cut with the dagger. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace clenched her teeth desperately to endure the pain. She did not want the enemy to feel smug because of her pain and the people who cared about her to get upset over this. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the more she endured, the harder Katherine Jackson dug her fingernails into her wounds with her free hand. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, aren't you smug? Aren't you trying to stand up for your best friend? Do you see the price of your actions now?" Katherine Jackson asked viciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace kept breaking out in a cold sweat, her face ghastly pale from the pain and all the bleeding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was already in tears when she saw the state her best friend was in. "Katherine Jackson, Grace is innocent! As you said, she was just helping me. I'm the one you're after, so go after me. You can torture me all you want, but stop doing that to Grace..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's pain only made Katherine Jackson laugh. "If you want me to let her go, sure. Jump off the building and we'll call it even. I'll let her go if you do that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's body trembled as her eyes seemed to contain some determination. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, don't listen to her..." Grace said with difficulty. Every word she said would bring her unimaginable pain. "Lina... if you do... what she says, I&rsquo;ll never forgive you, and... I&rsquo;ll never forgive myself. Besides... do you really think... she'll let me go... after you jump?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's tears poured out more violently. She hated herself for being so weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It's me. It's all my fault. I misunderstood Hadwin and refused to give him my trust. Now, I caused my friend to suffer.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina... Don't cry..." Grace caught her breath and said with difficulty. Then, she turned to say to Katherine Jackson, "Katherine Jackson... You don't have any real friends, do you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Ashamed with anger, Katherine Jackson snapped. "Shut up! One more word from you and I&rsquo;ll cut your windpipe so that you can never speak again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Katherine Jackson, you're asking for trouble!" shouted Jason with a solemn face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I am. What's the matter? Does this break your heart? How about this? Since Lina refuses to jump off the building to save Grace, let's see how far you can go for Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason narrowed his eyes, waiting for Katherine Jackson's next move. Grace suddenly had a premonition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her heart sank when she heard what Katherine Jackson said. It verified her premonition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I want you to take off all your clothes and show your men their boss' body. Hahaha, they all say that Emerald City's Young master Reed is known for his good looks. It seems that not just many of Emerald City's socialites are in love with you but some men too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson changed her tone and said, "I wonder if you're going to keep or kill these subordinates after they see you naked when this is over, Young master Reed? After all, their existence will remind you of the humiliation you suffered today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her words were biting, driving Jason and his subordinates into the corner.</p></div>
