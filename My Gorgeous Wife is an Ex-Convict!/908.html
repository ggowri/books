        <h1>Chapter 907</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took a deep breath before getting into the car with Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Kyla's phone rang. Kyla looked at the caller ID and saw that it was her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She picked it up and heard Mrs. Corbyn's anxious voice from the phone. "Yun, where are you? The check-in process is going to be over soon if you don't come now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson and I can't go over now, Mom. Why don't you find a small hotel to stay in first?" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened?" asked Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla raised her eyes only to meet Martin Weiss's. He seemed to want to see how she would answer, and there was a cold sneer on the corner of his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson, who was sitting between them, looked up at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The father and son had somewhat similar eyes, but now they seemed even more alike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson and I are now with Martin Weiss," Kyla said in a calm voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a gasp on the other end of the line, followed by Mrs. Corbyn's panicked voice. "Did... Did he see Nelson? Then he... and you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Mrs. Corbyn's voice was almost stuttering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, Mom. I'll take care of it." With that, Kyla ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll take care of it? I'd like to know how you&rsquo;re going to take care of this," Martin Weiss said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was stunned. Nelson, who was sitting between them, seemed to be frightened by Martin Weiss's cold voice. However, he raised his chin and said to Martin Weiss, "Uncle, don't talk to Mommy like that. She'll be scared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know what they were talking about, but he could feel his mother's fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I want to protect Mommy!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one thought so as he turned sideways, facing Martin Weiss with his back against Kyla as if he was protecting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the small body in front of him, Martin Weiss could not help being silent. The little one was friendly to him before, but now, he had puffed up his cheeks because of Kyla. It was as if he would not allow his mother to be frightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this my child?' Even if he repeatedly denied it, looking at those eyes that were somewhat similar to him, he could not deny it any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If... this is my child, then... When did she conceive him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me. How old are you?" he asked in a whisper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson blinked and began to gesture with his fingers. "I'll be four in two months!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Two months&hellip;' Martin Weiss felt a pang in his heart. 'Was she three months pregnant before she went to prison?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly recalled the moment she had shouted to him at the top of her voice, "Martin Weiss, I'm pregnant. It's your baby!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How did I answer her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, he was afraid to recall what he had said at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes fell on the hearing aid Nelson was wearing. It had a fluorescent blue cartoon animal on its shell, which made the child look cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this hearing aid kept reminding him that this was a deaf child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without the hearing aid, such a child would be deaf and mute forever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is my child actually disabled?'</p></div>
