        <h1>Chapter 2259</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's arms suddenly tightened around Grace. Every time he saw Martin Weiss, he realized how lucky he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had coldly watched Grace get imprisoned back then. If he had intervened, Grace would not have suffered in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, Grace forgave him and was willing to be with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace chuckled. "What's come over you? We're talking about Kyla and Martin Weiss. What are you thanking me for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for being willing to forgive me. If you had refused to forgive me, I'm afraid I'd be worse off and more miserable than Martin Weiss," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned around and fixed her eyes on Jason. "Jay, I can only be truly happy because there&rsquo;s no other man in the world who can love me like you do. And neither can I love anyone else as much as I love you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, her hands caressed his face. "Thank you for falling in love with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had not fallen in love with her, would she have a different fate? Perhaps she would never be able to reverse her case and might even struggle to survive. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for picking me up." He gently brushed his cheek against her palm. Then, he bent down and kissed her on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time the kiss was over, Grace's face was red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason gazed intently at the person in front of him. "Grace..." His hoarse voice whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He picked her up sideways, and the meaning was obvious enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace wrapped her arms around Jason's neck. Everything went without saying...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was glad she had chosen to forgive him back then, and now, she was happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she wondered if Kyla would be happy too if she could forgive Martin Weiss one day?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A slap hit Jacqueline Bowman hard in the face, sending her knocking into a nearby coffee table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How dare you, Jacqueline Bowman?! You kept telling me that you helped Kyla a lot previously and she would surely repay you, so I bragged about it to my friends. I said that I had Weiss Group's project in the bag. Then what happened? You got nothing out of it!" Neal Reid snapped at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman felt only a burning pain in her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Covering her cheek, she said quickly, "Yes... I did help Kyla out a lot back then. I didn't expect her to be so heartless. She won't even do me such little favor when I... I've gone to see her several times. Why don't... Why don't I go look for her again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go look for her again?" Neal Reid sneered. "Are you going to see her or Martin Weiss again? Do you know that when I was at Weiss Group today, Martin Weiss warned me in front of others to control the people around me and not let women do something they shouldn't do to him?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid felt so humiliated that he wanted to hide as he thought of the encounter earlier today. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people he knew were present, and the reputation he had worked so hard to create was ruined. Who knew how many of them were laughing at him behind his back, thinking he sent someone to sleep with Martin Weiss? They must have thought he had lost his mind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man like Martin Weiss could have any woman he wanted. Would he want someone who had already slept with Neal Reid?</p></div>
