        <h1>Chapter 2835</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He probably considered it a white lie to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," she said, slowly pulling her hand away from his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A strange feeling of emptiness swept over him as he looked at his empty hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car stopped at the entrance of the charity gala. After Valda Theller and Brian got out of the car, there were flashing lights. Valda Theller tried to avoid them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't be afraid." Brian's voice rang in her ears. "These are just some routine shots. But don't worry, your photos won't appear online."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was reassured as she knew he was capable of doing just that. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to look into the cameras. If you don't know where to look, just look at me." His voice continued to ring in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She calmed down slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay... I... I understand," replied Valda Theller as she looked at the Brian standing beside her. Her tense mood seemed to calm down too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Holding Brian's arm, Valda Theller followed Brian's steps and slowly walked into the gala venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although some reporters and cameras could be seen inside the venue, they were not as many as the ones outside. Besides, as Brian said before, the reporters did not come forward to interview them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked around. Tonight was indeed a night full of stars. The stars who attended the gala were big shots in the industry. She saw A-listers everywhere. There were few B-listers, let alone C-listers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could feel the celebrities looking at her as if they were examining something. Their gazes were envious, mocking, or expectant of drama.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, she caught sight of Phoebe Cross in a gown out of the corners of her eyes. She froze instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the two of them had met not that long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross saw her as well. With a disdainful yet calculating look on her face, she turned and walked the other way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Brian, who was standing beside her, asked as he seemed to notice something wrong with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing." Valda Theller said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What a surprise. Didn't you say you weren't interested in charity galas? I thought you weren't coming." A voice rang out, and Valda Theller looked in the direction of the voice to see a familiar figure approaching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Patrick!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller recognized him immediately. Brian had introduced him to her. He was Brian's friend since childhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at Brian in surprise. "You didn't want to attend the gala?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled faintly. "I didn't plan to attend, but I came with you since you wanted to attend it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller paused slightly. It turned out... he came specially to accompany her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick walked up to the two of them and greeted Valda Theller, "Hi, Valda. You've changed a lot during the short time we didn't meet. You look beautiful today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," Valda Theller replied politely with a slightly red face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm afraid you'll be someone everyone in the entertainment industry wants to suck up to after attending the gala today," Patrick said with a smile.</p></div>
