        <h1>Chapter 589</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some reporters discovered that Evelyn was selling off her house and jewelry. Even the house her parents lived in was put on sale online, presumably to gather money for the penalty for breach of contract.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A busybody managed to get all of Evelyn&rsquo;s uncompleted contracts and worked out that the total amount of compensation was estimated to be more than 70 million dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For Evelyn, a D-list actress with a normal family background, this was a big number. Selling all her possessions might not even be enough to cover it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the news on her phone, and one of the photos showed information about her family home that they had given the real estate agent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were some collages of the interior of the house in the information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Cummins family's sale price online was 5,800,000 dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The house with memories of her and her mother was now up for sale for 5,800,000. Grace felt a little emotional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Actually, after so many years, there were hardly any traces of her mother in the house. There were more traces of Evelyn and Melinda Riley in the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you looking at?" Jason walked over to Grace. He looked down at her phone screen and raised his eyebrows slightly. "Is your old house on sale?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, the Cummins family is selling their house," Grace replied as she nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want it?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little stunned as she looked at him. Clearly, he would buy the house for her right away if she wanted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shook her head and said, "No, I have more bad memories than good memories in this house."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mother had only lived there for three years, but her stepmother and Evelyn had been living there for more than 20 years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, you've known Brian for years. Is he... Looking for someone?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason froze unnoticeably. Then, he asked, "Why are you suddenly asking this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I read some gossip online. Some netizens were talking about Brian. It says that all of his girlfriends are actually substitutes, so I just got curious about it," said Grace. She thought about what Brian had said to her that night when he was drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she first met Brian because of a small bracelet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you curious about him?" Jason asked with a twinkle in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace replied, "I'm just curious about this." After all, she almost became one of the substitutes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace's hand and rubbed it gently in his, saying, "Then you can only be curious about this. You mustn't be curious about him at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blinked, clearly puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He drew her fingers to his lips and kissed them. "If a woman is curious about a man, she may be interested in that man one day. Maybe... She would even fall in love with the man. Therefore, the only man you can be curious about is me, not any other men."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know whether to cry or laugh. Was this also a sign of him being domineering in their relationship? Was he jealous again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shall... I forget that I asked?" she asked. She had just mentioned it casually and did not need to know the answer.</p></div>
