        <h1>Chapter 232</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmm..." Grace subconsciously raised her hand, trying to push him away. After he caught her right hand, without thinking much, she raised her left again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As his fingers pressed against her left hand, she gave a sudden gasp and unconsciously opened her mouth to cry out, "It hurts!&rdquo; It was a cry that allowed him to deepen the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was almost suffocated by the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was some time before the kiss ended, and he let go of both her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt her legs go limp, and she almost slipped off the chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He held her waist in one hand and lifted her left hand gently in the other. "Did I hurt you, Sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip and glared at Jason. "Why did you do that just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because I don't like to hear Sis say things that I don't want to hear." He smiled softly, looking gentle as could be. "I don't mind kissing you again if you're going to say something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." She was stunned but said nothing more for fear that he would mean what he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked down carefully at the unrelenting swelling on the back of Grace's hand. "You'll have to take proper care of this wound. I'm afraid it's inconvenient for you to recuperate here. How about you go to my place to recuperate?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" She was shocked. "Your place?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, we'll go to Reed Residence. There are many rooms there. Sis can choose any room you want, and there will be servants waiting on you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No!" She refused quickly. "I'm used to living here. Besides, it's not like I'm badly hurt. I&rsquo;m still perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I don&rsquo;t need people to wait on me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face grew cold. A layer of haze seemed to cloud over those beautiful, amorous eyes. "You don't want to?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her throat tightened. She really did not want to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would only get more and more involved with him by staying at his place. She did not want to have anything to do with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment's hesitation, she swallowed the saliva flowing between her throat and said, "You said you won&rsquo;t force me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I did say I won&rsquo;t force you, but that was only if you were willing to stay by my side. Now it's just a matter of having you over to recuperate for a few days so that I don&rsquo;t have to worry about you." He smiled. "Sis, do you want me to worry about you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His smile, like a mountain, pressed hard on her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The unstoppable light shining in his eyes let her know that her rejection was useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, he was the emperor of Emerald City. Once he decided on something, the others could only obey him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was like an ant in front of him that could not even rebel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she did not agree, there were a hundred ways this man could make her agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace uttered out the four words in her mouth, "Alright, I'll go."</p></div>
