        <h1>Chapter 1124</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson asked in confusion, "Is that lady a bad person? Also, why did she say Mommy and Aunt have been to prison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn did not know how to explain to her son all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace crouched down and touched the little one's head. "Even if someone has been to prison, they're not necessarily a bad guy. Look, Nelson. I did spend time in prison, but a bad guy framed me. However, the law gave me justice and caught the real bad guy in the end."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one half-understood but breathed a sigh of relief when Grace said the real bad guy had been caught.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about Mommy? Was Mommy set up by bad guys too?" The little one turned his head and looked at his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn took a deep breath. Even though there were things she tried so hard to avoid, she had to face them eventually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's just a matter of facing it earlier,' she told herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson, I've done nothing wrong. I have a clear conscience. What the lady said today is all false. I've never harmed her, " said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to drag the kid into the adults' feud, but now... Nelson still learned something that he should not know at his age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one's eyes that were similar to Kyla Corbyn's gently blinked as if he was pondering these words. After a moment, a smile finally appeared on the little one's face. "Okay, I trust Mommy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was enough for the child that his mother was a good person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her son's trust made Kyla Corbyn's eyes moist all of a sudden. All her life, few things could affect her mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not even care how people viewed her time in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Nelson was the only exception. She did not want to be a bad mother in the eyes of her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson immediately panicked when he saw that his mother's eyes were turning red. "Mommy, don't cry. Don't cry..." As he spoke, he desperately stood on tiptoes and stretched out his small hand toward Kyla Corbyn's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn picked up her son, and the little one immediately reached out his hand to touch Kyla Corbyn's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said gently, "I&rsquo;m not crying. Nelson, I'm strong. I'll be stronger than anyone else for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one was relieved when he saw that his mother was not crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was almost time to set up the stall. Kyla Corbyn handed Nelson to Mrs. Corbyn and pushed the motorcycle stall out of the house. Grace helped her push the stall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they were out of the house, Kyla Corbyn gave Grace a wry smile. "Maybe I shouldn't have been so submissive. I should try hard to clear my name. This way, at least Paisley Daniels won't be able to attack us in front of Nelson like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not too late. We can try to find evidence again, but... it probably won't happen before the custody case is over," Grace said regretfully. Whether Kyla Corbyn's previous case could be overturned, it would not be resolved before the custody case was decided.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It also meant that Kyla Corbyn's criminal record was sure to weigh against the custody case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I see." Kyla Corbyn looked at Grace and said, "Grace, no matter what happens with the custody case, thank you for helping me out!"</p></div>
