        <h1>Chapter 3852</h1>
        <div>.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm willing." This was Veronica's answer to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, how could she not be willing? When this man rushed into the explosion site and risked his life to save her, and when at the final moment of danger, he would rather die on the scene himself than let her stay, she already understood what kind of existence he was to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was a more precious existence than her own life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then we'll get married as soon as we graduate, is that okay?" Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Veronica hesitated for a moment, "What about my father and stepmother..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've taken care of it. They shouldn't come looking for trouble again," Mason said, "If you want to sever ties, I think they should understand that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at Mason suspiciously. She knew her father and stepmother's personalities well. People like them, if they found out that she and Mason were back together and talking about marriage, how could they easily give up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you bribe them? How much did they ask for?" she asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know you don't like this. How could I do something that would make you unhappy?" Mason said. Although it was easy to bribe greedy people, he didn't want to do something that would upset her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then did you...take matters into your own hands?" Veronica continued to guess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason looked a little guilty now. "It wasn't exactly taking matters into my own hands, but I did give your father a little kick."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica blinked. Was he uncomfortable? She rarely saw this expression on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that all?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And I said a few...threatening words," Mason replied, his expression becoming awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh," Veronica responded flatly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her indifferent reaction surprised Mason a bit. "Aren't you angry?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why should I be angry? Because you stepped on my father? Well, I don't even want to call that kind of person my father. If I had gone with you, maybe we could have caught up to him and given him a beating!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When her father sent those thugs to ask her for money, the last bit of affection she had for him disappeared!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her father should have known what kind of people those thugs were. If she had really fallen into their hands, who knows what would have happened to her, or even her whole life could have been ruined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her father probably just wanted to use those thugs to make himself a tool to ask for money from the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing Veronica's words, Mason's expression returned to normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's find a place to have lunch first, and then decide whether to go back to the Reed House or..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have somewhere I want to go this afternoon," Veronica interrupted Mason and pursed her lips. "I want to go to the detention center and see Daniel."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Mason's eyebrows furrowed. "You want to see Daniel?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, the trial is coming up soon, and I want to see him again before it starts," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's there to see in him?" Mason's eyes showed obvious displeasure. "Or is it that you still can't let go of him? Do you feel guilty for what happened to him? Or do you have some other kind of guilt towards him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't like any of those possibilities!</p></div>
