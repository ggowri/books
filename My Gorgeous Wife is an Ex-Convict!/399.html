        <h1>Chapter 398</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was different now. As his love for her deepened little by little, he found some things unacceptable now. If he could not have her as his wife, then he would rather not have children at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at the face before her and heard him say, "I'm the only person you can depend on for the rest of your life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he kissed her on the lips. It was a tender kiss but was vaguely overbearing. She had no power to resist it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Depend on him... Could they?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was how her relationship with Jason began, which was somewhat unexpected for Grace. However, it was not causing any discomfort for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, it even made her feel like she was back with him in the rented house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was Jason again. She could forget about her burden and pain. She could relax in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Great. Thank you, thank you!" Kyla Corbyn's voice on the phone made Grace look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She saw her usually demure boss with a face full of excitement, even her eyes seemed to glisten with tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened, Kyla?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn excitedly held Grace and said, "It's a call from the hospital. They have an assistance program that helps deaf children from poor families. They hope they can help Nelson. I've always wanted to make an appointment with an expert in cochlear implants, but I couldn't. Now the hospital said that the expert can examine Nelson. They also said that if Nelson fits their conditions, they can replace his ordinary cochlear implants to more advanced ones for free."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn felt like she was in a dream. She could not believe that this would happen to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It felt like she had hit the jackpot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace knew that it was Jason who made this happen. Watching Kyla Corbyn so happy, she knew that Nelson would get better treatment. Nelson's deformity could be gradually remedied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, when Grace returned to Reed Residence, she looked at Jason and said, "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you thanking me for?" He leaned on the sofa with his chin in one hand. He looked at her with eyes brimming with charm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for helping Nelson," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll do anything you want, Sis," he said, putting his hand around her shoulders. She had been standing near the edge of the sofa when she was caught off guard and fell into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can like the boy, but not too much, Sis. I don't like it when there's someone more important than me," he said. His unique domineering quality was now completely exposed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was just like a child! Grace's hands subconsciously pushed against Jason's chest. She was trying to stand up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was wearing a thin silk night robe, and as she did so, her palm was separated from his breast by only a thin layer of silk. His body temperature immediately passed through the silk to her palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blushed and instinctively withdrew her hand, but he held her hand to keep it firmly against his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're blushing because of this? You don't need to blush even if you're touching my entire body right now. You can touch every inch of my body, Sis," muttered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt like her nose was about to bleed.</p></div>
