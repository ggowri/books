        <h1>Chapter 2044</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At the end of the week, Chase Harper drove to the store with his daughter to pick up Kyla. The two children sat in the back, while Kyla sat in the front passenger seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the way, Nelson took care of Juliet Harper like a little adult. Juliet Harper sat in a child safety seat and kept talking to Nelson like a little chatterbox. For example, she talked about what cartoons she had been watching lately, what she had drawn, and how long before she could start going to kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is kindergarten fun, Nelson?" the little one asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn's eyes darkened. He did not have a good impression of kindergarten. His mother's case had yet to be reversed at the time, so children and their parents would taunt him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was young and did not understand many things back then, but now he understood more about grown-ups and the injustice of society.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even if his mother had reversed the case, his disability would make him suffer from countless strange gazes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even if he was better than many ordinary people, it was useless. He was still deaf to everyone else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nelson?" Juliet asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn smiled and replied, "Kindergarten is fun. There are lots of games to play with the kids."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Can I go to the same kindergarten as Nelson?" the little one asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm already in primary school. You can only enter primary school after you graduate from kindergarten." Nelson Corbyn began to tell the little one what kindergarten and elementary school were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the car arrived at the amusement park, the four of them entered the amusement park after Chase Harper parked the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn held Juliet's hand and took care of her like a big brother, prompting Chase Harper to say, "Nelson has really grown up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla took many photos of her son, and she could see that he was having fun playing with Juliet. Juliet could not play some games due to her height, so Nelson Corbyn did not play them either. He would only play those Juliet could play.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In one part of the amusement park was an indoor play area where parents could not enter but only children. Juliet wanted to go inside to play, so Kyla urged her son to look after Juliet while she and Chase Harper watched the two children play on the platform outside the play area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you for coming to the amusement park with Juliet and me today. Juliet is so happy today. She hasn't been this happy since her mother and I got divorced," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla hesitated a little before saying, "If there's any misunderstanding in your marriage, why don't..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"There's no misunderstanding. I walked in on her sleeping with my best friend. I asked her and she said she wanted to be with my friend. Life with me wasn&rsquo;t what she wanted, and she didn't even want our daughter anymore," Chase Harper said bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had buried these things in his heart. Even after the divorce, he only told outsiders that they had irreconcilable differences. He even kept the truth from his own parents, hoping to preserve some decency for his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not want this to overshadow his daughter's future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he told Kyla what he had been keeping in his heart. Perhaps he was too miserable, so he would like to talk to someone about it.</p></div>
