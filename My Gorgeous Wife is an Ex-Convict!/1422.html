        <h1>Chapter 1421</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No matter how hard he hit himself, it seemed impossible for him to vent out the pain he was feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Ah... Ah... Ah!" A hoarse sob-like roar came out of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Everything in the past flashed through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn had kept telling him that she was wronged but he did not believe her at all. At that time, he was bent on retaliating against her and the Corbyn family. He just hoped that she had really pushed Paisley Daniels down the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because only in this way could he easily let her have a miserable end and make himself guilt-free!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had ruthlessly and viciously stabbed her back while using the law as a knife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had crushed... her dignity, pride, and innocence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin, do you believe in being with only one person forever?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Of course! If a person really loves another person, then they probably won't fall in love with someone else again. If they do fall in love with someone else, then the person they fell in love with before wasn&rsquo;t someone they really loved. I hope I can be with you forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So am I the one you really love?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah. I love you with all my heart. Kyla Corbyn will only love Martin Weiss in this life. I won't fall in love with anyone else!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She would only love me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Back then, she was innocent and beautiful. She had loved him so passionately and straightforwardly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he utterly destroyed all her love!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The sound of footsteps rang out and Grace walked up to Martin Weiss. She looked down at Martin Weiss who was on his knees and trembling. "Martin Weiss, you owe Kyla too much. She saved you. What about you? Will you give your life to her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss slowly looked up, his face full of shame and pain. He smiled miserably. "She won&rsquo;t... take my life at all. If she wants it, I can give it to her. I can give her anything..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, even if he did die in front of Kyla countless times, it would still not be enough to make up for all her suffering!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Since you're willing, donate your liver to Kyla! She has liver cancer and only has a few months to live!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes widened immediately, and he looked at Grace in disbelief. For a moment, it was as if the sky had fallen on him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In Reed Group's president's office, Harold Atkinson sulkily looked at the man who had almost become his son-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason&mdash;the head of Reed Group. Although Old Master Reed was still the chairman of the company, everyone knew that Old Master Reed could not hold on much longer. The Reed family would fall into the hands of Jason in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If his eldest daughter had married Jason, the Atkinson family would be in such a mess now.</p></div>
