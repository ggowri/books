        <h1>Chapter 3190</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at the booklet and the designer introductions, and was momentarily unsure of what to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you have a crush?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda said, "They all look very nice. I don't know which one to choose."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's try on a few different types first and then make a specific choice," said Brian. He then pointed to one of the wedding dresses in the catalog and asked, "What do you think of this one?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked and saw that Brian had chosen a wedding dress with a waist-cinching, open-top style. The skirt was adorned with many hand-embroidered roses, and the dress had a simple, straight-cut design with a straight neckline. The embroidery added a touch of grandeur and elegance to the dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It is very beautiful and elegant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was immediately drawn to this wedding dress. The one she chose would allow her legs to move without attracting attention, while also fitting her personal style.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's try this one," said Valda. She then went with the staff to the dressing room to change into the wedding dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian was sitting on the sofa waiting. Actually, it didn't matter to him what kind of wedding dress she wore, as long as she was happy and satisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since he wants her to marry him, he will surely make her happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as she likes the wedding dress...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when Valda appeared in front of Brian in a wedding dress, he suddenly realized that the type of dress she wore was not insignificant to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He found her so beautiful in the wedding dress that he couldn't take his eyes off her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted to keep her to himself and not let anyone else see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it pretty?" Valda asked as she walked up to him in the wedding dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's very beautiful," he replied in a slightly hoarse voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned around slowly because of her leg, "I think you have good taste. I also think this wedding dress is pretty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But to him, it wasn't just the dress that was beautiful, it was the person wearing it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Standing in front of the full-length mirror, Brian bent down and asked Valda, "Are you really ready to marry me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," she said, "Brian, I want to marry you and see you every day." She also wanted to have children with him and have a big family in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What she wants, actually has a lot, a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And marrying him was the beginning of it all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, then on the agreed day, you will be Mrs. Hart!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, Valda tried on several more wedding dresses, but still felt that the first one she tried on looked the best. Therefore, she tentatively decided on the first one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Afterwards, you will need to communicate with the designer and discuss the details.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the following days, Valda had a lot to do besides work, as she had to deal with many things related to her wedding. For example, she had to communicate with the designer about some modifications to her wedding dress. In addition to the wedding dress, she also had to finalize her dress, choose jewelry, and decide on her makeup and hairstyle for the big day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't realize there were so many things to do for a wedding." Valda looked at Camille, who was trying on her bridesmaid dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille smiled and said, "You're lucky. The Hart family is taking care of a lot of things, so you haven't been too busy. Otherwise, with a wedding like this involving a wealthy family, there would be so much to prepare for that you would have been exhausted and wouldn't have had the energy to work!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Agreed," Valda said, then glanced at her friend. "What do you think of the bridesmaid dresses? Which set do you like?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take this outfit," said Camille, admiring herself before changing out of the formal dress and leaving the store with Valda.</p></div>
