        <h1>Chapter 2051</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Go away," Chase Harper said with a chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'My future wife... Speaking of which, Kyla is indeed a good woman. Life would probably be better if I lived with a woman like that.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he also knew that Kyla only considered him as a friend. The one who truly occupied Kyla's heart was the person called Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her heart was only as dead as ashes because Martin Weiss had hurt her too deeply!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper was thinking about it when he heard a staff member shouting at the shop&rsquo;s entrance, "Can I help you, Sir?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked up and instantly froze when he saw the tall figure entering the shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'That's... Martin Weiss!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even after so many years, Chase Harper could still recognize him at a glance. After all, a man with such good looks was unforgettable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss walked up to Chase Harper and looked coldly at the man in front of him. His chest was filled with gloom, and he felt a pricking sensation as he thought of Kyla and Chase Harper walking out of the market while talking and laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was a little breathless. It felt as if many needles were stabbing his chest, making him uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Am I jealous... I must be jealous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'She can eat with this man and talk and laugh with him but can&rsquo;t bear to spare me a minute. It's as if she hates every minute she spends with me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What can I do for you, Mr. Weiss?" asked Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss looked at him coldly. "You still remember me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm afraid it's hard not to forget someone like you, Mr. Weiss," replied Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How about going out for a chat, then? After all, this is not an appropriate place to talk," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper pondered for a moment and said, "Okay. Let's go out for a chat. There's a restaurant next to the market with a private room where we can chat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said nothing but turned around and walked out of the store. Chase Harper followed suit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They went to the private room of a nearby restaurant and ordered two cups of tea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper looked at the man in front of him. He was dressed in a suit and tie with his black hair and bangs combed back, revealing his full forehead. His cold face and delicate features showed an air of nobility. There was something elegant about him even though he was just sitting there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Such a man could easily attract many women's attention. That was how Kyla fell for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I wonder what you want to talk to me about, Mr. Weiss," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss chuckled. "Besides Kyla, do you think there&rsquo;s anything else for us to talk about?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper laughed at himself at this. "You're right. So are you here to talk to me about Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the word &lsquo;Kyla&rsquo; came out from Chase Harper's mouth, Martin Weiss frowned and found it particularly irritating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can&rsquo;t call her name like that!&rdquo; Martin Weiss said in a cold voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper said calmly, "Kyla never said I can&rsquo;t call her that, so I don't think there's anything wrong. But Mr. Weiss, who are you to think I can't call her that?"</p></div>
