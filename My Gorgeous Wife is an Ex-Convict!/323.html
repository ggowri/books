        <h1>Chapter 322</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He didn't bother me much. Your son is cute," said Grace. "However, he seems to crave noodles. He keeps staring at it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you give him noodles, he may or may not eat it. He just likes to join in the fun," the woman said and started to gesticulate with both hands in front of the little boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned and immediately noticed what the woman was doing... Sign language!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He..." she blurted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman said, "He can't hear, but he already knows some sign language, so he understands simple gestures."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman said and continued to slowly say, "Apologize to Aunty," while signing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Grace saw the little boy bow in her direction as if to express his apology.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help rubbing the little boy's head. He was so young, but he could not hear. Was all the sound in this world non-existent to him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman carried the little boy away while Grace continued to eat her noodles, but it left her with a heavy heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She finished her noodles and was about to leave the small restaurant when out of the corner of her eye, she caught sight of a job posting on the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were looking for riders to deliver takeouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then turned around and headed to the cashier desk, asking the boss, "Are you looking for riders?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." She nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Can I apply?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The boss looked at Grace, a little confused. "As a rider?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can't I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's just that you're still young. Women your age usually don't want hard jobs like riders," said the boss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's hard enough for me to have a job, I..." Grace hesitated a little and told her truthfully, "I've been to prison and I have a criminal record. It's hard to find a job when that car accident killed someone. If possible, I want this job."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace said she had been to jail, the boss' eyes flickered a little and she seemed a little surprised. "However, the salary is fixed. You'll deliver food during rush hours and when you're not delivering food, you'll have to help out in the restaurant. You'll only get 4,000 dollars a month. Would you like to do it? However, I'll provide you with two meals a day&mdash;lunch and dinner. You'll start work at 9.30 am and finish at 9 pm. The hours are also longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For Grace, 4,000 dollars was nearly double of what she used to earn as a sanitation service worker. As for hard work, it would be nothing when one's survival was in question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure!" Grace said immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The boss looked at Grace and smiled as she said, "Then you can come to work tomorrow. We have an electric bike for deliveries. You don't have to buy an electric bike if you don't have one. Just use the one we have."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you!" Grace said gratefully. "I'll be here on time tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect her job hunting to take a new turn.</p></div>
