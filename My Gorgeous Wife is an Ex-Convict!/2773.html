        <h1>Chapter 2771</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He should not have any feelings for Kyla anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only had these mood swings because of his memories and the woman he remembered loving!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss gasped for air with difficulty as he pressed one hand on his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Damn it. My heart seems to hurt again. It hurts so much... that I'm almost breathless...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had been following the news in L City these days. She was stunned when she read the news of Shana Nicholls's arrest, which revealed that Shana Nicholls had something to do with the rumors earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, some parts of the news were vague, so some content must have been inappropriate for public disclosure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though Weiss Group's stock price recovered a bit upon Shana Nicholls's arrest, it suggested that the rumors had an impact after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Despite Shana Nicholls's arrest, Martin Weiss's marriage and health continued to draw attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Weiss Group and Martin Weiss himself said nothing about these.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No media outlet in Emerald City disturbed Kyla. Kyla figured Jason must have helped her out. Otherwise, she would have been surrounded by paparazzi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, Nelson Corbyn suddenly asked Kyla after he returned from school one day, "Mommy, are you and Daddy divorced?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. "Why did you ask that all of a sudden?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Someone in class said Daddy is having an affair. Is it true?" Nelson Corbyn asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla did not tell her son she had signed the divorce papers. She was waiting for the right time to tell her son about the divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she now knew Martin Weiss had not gone through the divorce procedures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not true. Your daddy didn't have an affair," said Kyla. Sometimes, her son was so precocious that it made her heart ache. "I'm sorry. I couldn&rsquo;t stop those rumors. Nelson, I only hope you can ignore them and trust that your daddy is serious about his relationships. He despises such things, so there's no way he'll have an affair."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So will you get a divorce?" Nelson Corbyn asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated slightly. Looking at her son's earnest expression, she finally said, "We will. We haven't divorced, but we&rsquo;ll probably divorce soon. But even if we're divorced and Daddy doesn't live with us, he still loves you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn's youthful face seemed disappointed, but then he said, "Mommy, I'll be on your side no matter what you decide. Even if you lose Daddy, you'll still have me and Tristas."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes watered as she hugged her son hard. This little child had been her reason to live. Without knowing it, he had become braver and more determined than she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After her son fell asleep that night, Kyla fed her daughter. Suddenly, her phone vibrated. Someone was calling her.</p></div>
