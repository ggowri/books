        <h1>Chapter 3891</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about you? You've graduated from college, are you going to marry William?" Veronica asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William has mentioned that he hopes to get married earlier in the future. As for me, I don't object," Jasper said openly. She didn't really care when she got married, but she knew that if she did, it would definitely be to William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William is a good person," Veronica commented. She had seen how good William was to Jasper over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, I will hold onto her tightly!" Jasper said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them chatted and laughed until they gradually fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day was the wedding day, and Veronica and Jasper were woken up early by someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Shirley also arrived at the villa early in the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was the bride today, while Shirley and Jasper were bridesmaids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The three women were surrounded by the makeup and styling team, and began changing clothes and getting their makeup done... It was a busy day, and it had finally begun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was one of the groomsmen today. When he saw Jasper in her bridesmaid dress, he could hardly take his eyes off her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pure white bridesmaid dress, the white pearl accessory on her head, and her oval face made her look so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially her dark almond eyes, they were so charming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do I look good?" Jasper walked up to William with a smile and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You look very good," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You look handsome today too!" Jasper complimented him with a smile. "You look like an adult in a suit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I really wish I was an adult now." If that were the case, they would be the same age, and he could marry her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed like his desire to marry her was becoming more and more urgent!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted her to truly belong to him as soon as possible, fearing that their feelings for each other would cause any waves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for Lawrence's desire for revenge and all the things he did wrong that caused her to completely cut ties with him, her feelings might have leaned towards Lawrence, who knows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all these years, she has always felt guilty towards Lawrence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Lawrence's feelings towards her, maybe they were deeper than even Lawrence himself realized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, Lawrence has no chance because he hurt Jasper's family, so Jasper will never be with Lawrence in this lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence's situation is also a warning to him. He won't make the same mistakes as Lawrence and will examine his own feelings more closely, then go after what he truly wants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean?" Jasper looked at William strangely. "Do you really want to be an adult? Actually, you're already legally an adult, there's nothing you can't do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I'm not a minor anymore, but that doesn't mean I can do everything an adult can," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was full of doubt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, you're the bridesmaid today, you'll be busy soon," William changed the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wedding party came out of the villa and the cars headed towards the hotel. Veronica and Mason sat in the back seat of the main car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your heels are high today," Mason suddenly said.</p></div>
