        <h1>Chapter 3437</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After getting on the subway, due to the weekend, there were a lot of people. Everyone inside the train was squeezed like sardines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was also squeezed. Suddenly, when they arrived at a station, a large group of people rushed in. Veronica was pushed by the person next to her and her body swayed to the other side. Just as she was about to lose her balance, a hand grabbed her waist and the next moment, she was buried in someone else's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was...Mason's embrace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was very familiar with his breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She tried to move her body to grab the handle, but he suddenly said, "Don't move. There are too many people now. Even if you raise your hand, it's hard to reach the handle."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay. Just lean on me like this. I'll hold the handle. We'll be getting off soon anyway." His voice continued to sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh." She responded and didn't try to grab the handle anymore. She just held onto his clothes to steady herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, with the movement of others in the carriage, her body would occasionally press against his chest. His breath almost enveloped her whole body, making her feel more vividly aware of their differences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, one of his hands was around her to prevent others from bumping into her, while the other hand was holding the handle, giving her an inexplicable sense of security.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once upon a time, she gradually shifted from being a protector to being protected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was already half a head taller than her, even though he was only 14 years old. He would surely grow even taller in the future, just like Uncle Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a few more years, he would shed his current awkwardness and transform from a boy into a man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about this, she suddenly felt her face flush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was wrong with her?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The subway finally arrived at their stop, and Veronica and Mason got off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, are you feeling hot? Your face is so red," he said, raising his hand to touch her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah?!" She was startled and instinctively avoided his hand. "I guess... um, it's just because there were too many people on the subway, so... it's a bit hot. Let's go outside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, she walked ahead of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He glanced at his empty palm, his eyelashes trembling slightly, and then caught up with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the two arrived at the entrance of No. 3 Middle School, Veronica called Daniel and he quickly came out to meet them. Together, they entered the school campus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have saved seats for you in the gymnasium. They are in a good location and you should be able to see clearly. By the way, would you like some drinks? I can go buy them for you," said Daniel enthusiastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I'll buy it for Veronica later," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well... Alright." Daniel scratched his head and looked at Mason, trying to find a topic. "Mason, do you like playing sports?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason?" Daniel looked at Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel said, "If Veronica can call you by this name, is it okay if I call you the same?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can call me Mason, or you can call me Yixue's younger brother. Mason is a name that only my family members usually call me," said Mason in a calm tone, but with a sense of distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Daniel said, "Alright, Mason. If you like playing ball, we can play together sometime in the future."</p></div>
