        <h1>Chapter 3397</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The marriage certificate was placed on a large table, and two children were looking at it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell could understand all the characters on the marriage certificate, while Harley could only understand a few. After all, Valda and Brian did not deliberately teach their daughter how to read characters. They would just casually mention something when they saw it from time to time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The most deliberate thing was just to teach his daughter to recognize and write her own name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell looked at the marriage certificate, picked up a pen, and without saying anything, signed his name. He then pressed his finger into the red ink pad and onto the certificate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next up is Harley's turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley looked at the marriage contract and learned from the adults that it represented a betrothal between her and Brother Lornell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So she also picked up a pen and signed her name on the marriage certificate with great seriousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Harley's posture while holding the pen was not very attractive, and the writing produced was crooked and uneven. This was especially true for the strokes in her name, with the final "ley" being written terribly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, after all, he is only a three-year-old child, so it's already good enough that he can write his own name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell frowned and looked at Harley's name on the marriage certificate, feeling that he was really... quite ugly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Harley finished writing her name, she felt exhausted. She furrowed her eyebrows and complained to Lornell, "Why do we have to sign and write our names on the marriage certificate? My name is difficult to write. Next time, can we just use fingerprints instead of names?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell frowned. "Next time?" Does she want to sign another marriage contract with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Can we sign this thing just once in our lifetime, please?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley was very skilled at taking fingerprints, but unlike Lornell who only took a single fingerprint, she pressed her right palm directly onto the ink pad and then "slapped" it onto the marriage certificate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They're just...playing around!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Quentin family members realized the situation and tried to stop it, but it was too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A bright red handprint suddenly appeared on the marriage certificate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This..." The Quentin family, who delivered the marriage proposal, looked very embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I printed more than Brother Lornell," said Harley proudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell was speechless. What was there to compare? But Harley continued to grin foolishly at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it doesn't work out, we can make another marriage certificate for the Hart family and have the two children sign and fingerprint again," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, this is fine!" said Lornell. "There's not much difference between palm prints and fingerprints anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," agreed the Quentin family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since the marriage certificate was in duplicate, the other copy also needed to be stamped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Harley's first copy was stamped with a palm print, the second copy was also stamped with a palm print.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the stamping was done, each family kept one copy of the marriage certificate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley looked at his red hand with ink and then at Lornell. "Brother Lornell, does this mean we will always be together from now on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell pursed his pretty lips. "I suppose so."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After he and she got engaged, his mother approached him again and asked, "Have you really thought this through? An engagement is not something you can just agree to and then change your mind about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't regret it." He answered his mother's words like this at the time, even answering quickly without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't even understand himself why he answered so quickly at that time.</p></div>
