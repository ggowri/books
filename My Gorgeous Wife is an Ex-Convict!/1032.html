        <h1>Chapter 1031</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good." He was a little relieved to see that she seemed a little better than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Heavens knew how he wished he could have taken her place when he saw her so weak! He wanted to see her full of energy and smiling all the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to do everything he could to protect his Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His large hands continued to rub her stomach carefully, hoping to ease some of the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I didn't get pregnant this time. I'm sorry I got you worried about nothing. Are you sure... you're not disappointed?" Lina could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not disappointed. I won't get disappointed whether you're pregnant or not because I know we'll have a baby someday. I just..." He paused. "I just stopped freaking out when I knew you weren't pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned. She did not expect him to use the words &lsquo;freak out&rsquo;. "You freaked out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I freaked out. When you were in the bathroom, I was wondering what I should do if you were really pregnant." He looked up and stared at her. "If you were pregnant, I would make you Mrs. Stephenson immediately. I would marry you into the Stephenson family so no rumors can hurt you and you can take good care of the baby..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was what he should do and what he wanted to do, but... "But Lina, if I did that, then you would be involved in the Stephenson family's war."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stroked her head. If he could, he did not want to tell her these things. However, he did not want her to misunderstand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Although I'm in charge of the Stephenson family right now, that doesn't mean they've given up. They&rsquo;re ready to take me down at any moment. It's not a big deal if you're just my girlfriend. However, if you get pregnant and marry me, you'll be a threat to them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina blinked her eyes. She learned what was going on with the Stephenson family from all sorts of gossip magazines and the internet, but after he told her this, she realized the internal war of a rich and powerful family in TV dramas was so close to reality and she was also a part of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to marry you when I've eliminated all the dangers in the Stephenson family," he said. He just wanted to create a comfortable environment for her and keep her safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will it be dangerous?" she asked quickly, more worried about his safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled gently. "Don't worry. Even if there's danger, I have a way to stay undefeated. I can't be the Stephenson family's patriarch if I can't even do that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before this, he wanted to be strong for himself. Now, he wanted to become strong, but it was more for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to better protect her and give her a better future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he could not lose in the Stephenson family's unfinished war!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson..." Lina put down the enamel cup and looked at the man she loved seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so wrapped in her love life that she forgot to think that perhaps every step he took in the Stephenson family was as dangerous as dancing on the blade of a knife. He could fall at any moment and be covered in blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he never told her these things. He just doted on her, loved her, and did his best to satisfy her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know I can't help you much. I know nothing about business and can't think of any schemes. I'm only good at drawing and fangirling, but..." His figure was reflected in her round eyes. "I won't let myself become your burden, and I won't let you freak out because of me!"</p></div>
