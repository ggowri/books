        <h1>Chapter 1056</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no one dared to step forward. They did not even dare to catch a breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, these two were the most powerful men in Emerald City. They would only become cannon fodder if they went forward now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what?" Jason asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace glared at Jason and held Brian's broken hand in hers. "Are you okay? Does it hurt? Is there a doctor here at the gala?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that some big parties had medical staff on standby in case someone had a sudden illness or something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm alright. I just broke my hand a little," said Brian. Speaking of which, it had been years since he felt the pain of getting a bone broken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, because of this pain now, he realized the severity of what Grace went through when she injured her fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How much pain would she have suffered? The pain would probably be ten times or a hundred times worse than what I'm suffering now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face was filled with guilt. She knew Brian's misfortune was all because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't be alright! If you don't treat it, maybe later..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Grace could finish her sentence, a strong force pulled her into a wide embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stiffened immediately and began to struggle. "Jason, let me go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he merely carried her on his shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian tried to stop him, but the bodyguards around Jason halted him. Even though there were many professional security guards at the gala, Jason had come well prepared. As such, he had already taken this into account.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The security guards could not get through Jason's men at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was so anxious that he ignored his broken wrist and struck back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the dangerous experience on the hill, he had been consciously training so that one day he would be able to save himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, not only to save himself but to one day protect the people he wanted to protect!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The always indifferent and elegant crown prince was now filled with murderous rage as he started hitting people like a mad man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even the professional bodyguards dared not get near him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't stop me. I&rsquo;ll make whoever stops me suffer for the rest of his life. I mean business, even if Jason is the figure behind you." That raging voice made people shudder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one doubted whether Brian was serious because his expression and the look in his eyes said it all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even a man he knocked down with one hand was mercilessly trampled on as he struggled to get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone who stood in front of him was now his enemies, and he was exceptionally ruthless to his enemies. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, when Brian ran toward Jason's car, the car was already in motion and drove away from him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was too late for Brian to catch up to it.</p></div>
