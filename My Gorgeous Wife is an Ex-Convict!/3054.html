        <h1>Chapter 3052</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I can't get the money, I can always find someone else to trade with in the future. However, I may not choose to trade with them next time." Phoebe said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a hint of amusement in the way he said it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda gritted her teeth secretly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, if I don't see you at the next location in a little while, then today's deal is canceled!" Phoebe said, and once again ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at the dangerous suspension bridge in front of her, gritted her teeth, climbed over the fence, and walked towards the bridge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, what are you doing?" Brian's voice came from her clothing button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda knows that at this moment, Brian should be with the police, but she doesn't know where he is watching this scene from.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian will protect her! Valda silently reassured herself in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Phoebe made me cross this suspension bridge to make a deal with her. If I don't cross it now, she might call me again for another deal and I don't know when that will be," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But this bridge is dangerous!" Brian exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the camera in Valda's zipper captured the bridge, the police had already gathered information about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This is a dangerous bridge that the government plans to repair soon. No one knows what will happen if you step on it now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know, but the bridge doesn't look too old and I'm light, so I should be able to cross it safely," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's too risky!" Brian insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But what about Jasmine if I don't cross?" Valda asked. She knew the danger, but she had to cross now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was speechless. He could only see the pictures sent by Valda's camera every 30 seconds, and each one made his heart race.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He heard the creaking sound of her stepping on the bridge through the communication device. He could almost imagine what it was like for her to walk on that dangerous bridge, but he couldn't do anything now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could only watch her take risks!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why isn't he the one risking his life right now? Why did they choose Valda? Why?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian kept shouting in his mind, but at this moment, he felt so powerless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a cry of alarm came from Valda through the communication device.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian hurriedly asked, "What's wrong? Valda? Valda!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I'm fine, I just missed a step earlier," Valda gasped, "Brian, don't worry, I can cross this bridge...no problem."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Brian couldn't help but worry, and even now, his palms were sweaty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Valda was crossing the suspension bridge, Jason, Philip, and the police were analyzing the destination after the bridge. After crossing the bridge, there was only a mountain road, and if the other party was there to trade, their options were limited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go here!" Jason pointed to a spot on the map, "This place is secluded and easy to escape from, it's a suitable place for trading."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person in charge on the police side nodded, obviously agreeing with Jason's analysis, "Then it's settled, let's expand the perimeter and once the trade is completed, we'll narrow it down and carry out the arrest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While they were discussing the plan over there, Valda was taking each step with difficulty on the suspension bridge, where every step was dangerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now, for her, there is no turning back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, when she crossed the suspension bridge, her legs almost gave out and it felt like she was walking on air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath and continued walking along the mountain road. However, not long after she passed by, there was a sudden explosion coming from the direction of the suspension bridge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned around and saw that the suspension bridge had already been blown up.</p></div>
