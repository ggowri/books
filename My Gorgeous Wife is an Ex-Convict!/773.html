        <h1>Chapter 772</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps Grace was really tired after a hard day. After eating some food, she fell into a deep slumber.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sat on the edge of the bed, staring gloomily at her sleeping face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She lay still as if she would not go anywhere, could not go, and could only remain in his sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was right in front of him, but why did he feel like he could not hold on to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Today she said she won't regret it, but why... do I think she&rsquo;s regretting it? I don't think she meant what she said!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scene of Brian carrying her on his back was like a scene in a movie that kept rewinding, replaying in front of his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never been so afraid! It was as if all he feared was coming true!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does Brian really mean nothing to you?" he murmured, his fingers softly touching her closed red lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was naturally impossible for her, who was asleep, to give him an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, even if you do fall in love with someone in the future, I don&rsquo;t want you to fall too deeply or put your life in their hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, do you know what cowardice is? It's when you hate someone, but you can't even bear to hurt them in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, don't learn from me. Don't be like me! It's too painful and hard. You can't even control your life..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His father's voice rang in his ears again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Control... I'm supposed to control everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I've trapped her by my side and have her firmly in my hand, haven't I?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, did you betray me?" His voice rang again, but he did not know whether he was asking her or himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm not my father, and my fate will not be the same as his!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he got up, went to his original room next door, and pulled open one of the drawers. There was a photo of her in a floral dress and the little silver bracelet he had taken from her grandmother's mementos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the same as the silver bracelet Brian had. They were originally a pair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I've tried so hard to keep them from recognizing each other, but did it work? Or maybe it's just&hellip;' His eyes grew darker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace woke up the next day, it was already after ten in the morning. Jason was not in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pulled back the covers, got out of bed, and washed up. The bruises from yesterday were mostly painless today, and the bruises on her wrist had faded by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at herself in the mirror. She had a deep sleep last night and felt very comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was because she had sorted out the doubts about her memory and let those matters go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Today&rsquo;s my birthday! Jason promised to make me a cake today.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's mood brightened again at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll surely enjoy my birthday today. It's my first birthday after getting out of prison.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they put on the candle, she would make her birthday wish. 'I&rsquo;ll wish him peace of mind and for him not to get hurt anymore. I&rsquo;ll wish that I can grow old with him.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After washing up, Grace changed into a dress she had prepared&mdash;a simple but elegant long white dress.</p></div>
