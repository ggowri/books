        <h1>Chapter 1235</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She's finally... mine. She's my rightful wife!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he had never cared about the piece of paper, it could help him tie her down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she was staying with him only for Lina and the babies, it did not matter as long as he had her by his side and could not go anywhere!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, if you want to leave me again, I won't be as 'gentle' as I was last time. I won't hesitate to break your wings by any means. Even if you hate me and even if you kneel again, I won't let you go," he murmured in a low voice that only he could hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her with endless fascination in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I never expected myself to be so infatuated with a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Although this woman has hurt me deeply, I can&rsquo;t bear to hurt her and desperately want her to stay by my side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How deep is my affection for her? Is it just like my father's feelings for my mother?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, I'm not my father, and I won't end up like him...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the car which had been driving smoothly suddenly changed directions. The driver slammed on the brakes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace woke up in a daze because of the sudden stop. She heard Jason's voice asking, "What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed, a car just forced our car to stop," the driver replied quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Forced the car to stop?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze and naturally looked out of the window, only to shudder at the sight of the silver-gray car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was... Brian's car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the next moment, she saw a familiar figure getting out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked blankly at the figure. However, the next moment, a pair of arms was wrapped around her waist. Then her upper body fell into the arms of the person behind her. "What's the matter? Why are you looking so intently at Brian? What's on your mind? Does your heart ache for him? Or do you regret agreeing to marry me?" His mutters rang softly in her ears. His voice was a whisper that was gentle and a little flirtatious, but the tone was cold. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip slightly and said, "I don't regret marrying you. As for Brian, he saved my life. Without him, I wouldn't be sitting in the car talking to you now, and the three babies in my belly wouldn't be safe and sound!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, she turned slightly to her side. She looked at him with those almond-shaped eyes of hers. "Jay, I have something to say to him. I need to make some things clear to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes glimmered. "Jay? Are you calling me Jay because you're worried I won't let you get out of the car to talk to him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "I'll call you Jay whether you let me out of the car or not. We're married. We're husband and wife. Despite whatever that has happened... I can't call you Mr. Reed now that we're married, can I? What I said at tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau was serious and not just a casual remark. Now that I've chosen to marry you, I want to make this marriage work."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gazed intently at her for a moment before finally saying, "Alright, go and make things clear to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he extended his long arm and opened the car door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace stepped out of the car, Brian's pupils shrank, and his whole body seemed to be teetering.</p></div>
