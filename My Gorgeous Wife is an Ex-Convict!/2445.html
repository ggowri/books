        <h1>Chapter 2443</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Louise Mitchell turned to say to the police, "Captain Wang, I hope the police can rescue my sister as soon as possible. She's in there now, and I don't know what they'll do to my sister. If anything happens to my sister..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man known as Captain Wang mused. This was a dilemma. Neither side was easy to deal with!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, George Gregory said, "Captain Wang, let's save them first. As for what evidence they have, it has nothing to do with the police. They should go through formal procedures instead of doing things illegally, right? If anything happens to Amber Mitchell under the police's watch, there would be no way to end this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Captain Wang finally said to Grace, Jason, and the rest as if he had made up his mind, "The police are doing their duty. Please get out of the way. If you continue to interfere, you&rsquo;ll have to bear the consequences."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla handed her phone to one of Brian's computer experts. "Please handle this.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." They turned on their laptops as they spoke, their fingers moving quickly across the keyboard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as the police were about to rush in, the screen that was used to announce queue numbers suddenly lit up. A video appeared on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The screen was linked to Kyla's phone, and the video on the screen was the video Kyla had filmed when she sneaked into the hospital the second time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had put a mini spy camera on her collar. She was afraid that she might miss something when she saw Amber Mitchell again, so she recorded it. She did not expect it to become evidence one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla yelled, "Here's my proof! You'll know how the Mitchell family tortured a normal person into becoming mentally ill after you watch this video!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla targeted the Mitchell family. She had to buy time. The most important thing now was to buy time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone's eyes were focused on the big screen while Louise Mitchell panicked. When was the video taken? Amber Mitchell seemed to only sit still and keep her head down. What proof kind of proof is that? What was going to happen next?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the more assertive Kyla was, the more uneasy Louise Mitchell's heart became.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George..." Louise Mitchell called to her husband in a whisper but found George Gregory staring at the screen seemingly with all his attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell gritted her teeth in hatred and said to the police, "This video is unnecessary. Captain Wang, how long are you going to stay here? If anything happens to my sister, I won&rsquo;t..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, several people suddenly rushed over before she could finish speaking. They raised their cameras to film the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expressions of the people on Louise Mitchell's side changed, while Grace's looked calm because Kyla had already told them she would be inviting the press over when she came. Hence, they were all mentally prepared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's with all these people? Get out. Kick them out!" Louise Mitchell instructed the Mitchell family's men, her uneasiness growing stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla lunged forward and said, "I invited these media! Since it's proof, more people should see it so they can judge whether Amber Mitchell should be given a mental evaluation!&rdquo; </p></div>
