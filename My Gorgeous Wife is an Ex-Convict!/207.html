        <h1>Chapter 206</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she heard the sound of her young, clear voice singing &lsquo;Man Bu Ren Sheng Lu&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What if we&hellip; get caught again and can&rsquo;t escape?&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s voice rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Idiot! With me here, how can we not escape? I&rsquo;ll definitely take you with me and escape!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;If you ditch me, you&rsquo;ll definitely be able to escape.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I'm going to ditch you! I said that I will protect you, so I&rsquo;ll protect you! I&rsquo;m not afraid of those bad guys!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you going to leave me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re friends!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Grace opened her eyes with a start. In a flash, she sat up on her bed with her eyes wide open. What entered her line of vision was the pale rays of light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was her rental home! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace abruptly breathed in as she looked at the time. It was only three in the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did she&hellip; have a dream? It seemed that she had dreamt of a conversation between her younger self and a boy. Furthermore, she had sung Teresa Teng&rsquo;s &lsquo;Man Bu Ren Sheng Lu&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Good heavens, why would she have had a dream like this? Could it be that she had listened to too many rounds of &lsquo;Man Bu Ren Sheng Lu&rsquo; back in Brian&rsquo;s car, so she dreamt of herself singing it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However&hellip; the situation in the dream had such a realistic feeling to it. It was as if it had really happened before&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, over at the Hart family&rsquo;s mansion, the lights in one of the rooms were still on. Brian sat in front of a painting, looking at it silently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the painting, a little girl was carrying a little boy on her back as she advanced through a thorny forest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers glided slowly over the little girl&rsquo;s face as he said in a low voice, &ldquo;When will I finally be able to see you again?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His mumbling voice seemed to hold some yearning, regret, loss, as well as an unspeakable pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were some people and some things that would never be forgotten with time and would instead become even brighter as time passed until they eventually turned into a form of obsession.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two days later, First Uncle called to urge Grace to pay for her quarter of the medical fees. After thinking it over, Grace still decided to make a phone call to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Lina, can you lend me 7,500 bucks? I kind of need it urgently, but I won&rsquo;t be able to pay you back straight away. Maybe just a little bit each month,&rdquo; Grace spoke with some difficulty. After all, the person she did not want to bother the most was Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina had already done so much for her, yet she was unable to repay her in any way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll transfer it straight to you with my phone,&rdquo; Lina replied readily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Grace uttered the two words softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Grace, there&rsquo;s no need to say those two words between us. You don&rsquo;t have to rush to pay this money back either. Whenever you have money, you can pay me back then,&rdquo; said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Despite those words being spoken, Grace still wanted to clear the payment as soon as she could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not owe Lina too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was why when Claire told her about a part-time job to earn some extra income and asked if she wanted to do it, she fervently agreed.</p></div>
