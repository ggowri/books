        <h1>Chapter 2078</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Stop thinking about it! Stop it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She told herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the car from last night pulled up in front of the store again. Kyla stiffened as she looked blankly at the person getting out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He walked toward her in the same suit he had worn yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She immediately tensed as both her hands grabbed the hem of her dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Kyla with remorse filling his face. However, he might do the same thing again if he got to do it all over again. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Maybe his subconscious did what he had always wanted to do through his intoxication.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he woke up today, she had left the hotel. Even though he was drunk, he had some vague impressions. Besides, the mess on the bed told him what had happened last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, Last night..." said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla instantly got up and snapped. "Nothing happened last night except that you were drunk and I sent you to a hotel room."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nothing happened?" Martin Weiss frowned as his eyes fell on her darkly. "Do you think I don't remember anything just because I was drunk? Last night, we clearly&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Shut up!" she interrupted abruptly. Glaring at the man in front of her, she uttered word by word, "Nothing happened last night!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss pressed his thin lips together tightly as their eyes met in mid-air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Mrs. Corbyn walked out from the room at the back. She immediately froze when she saw Martin Weiss. "What... What are you doing back here?" Then, she looked nervously at her daughter. "He didn't do anything to you, did he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, it's nothing," Kyla comforted her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said with a dark face, "Did last night mean nothing to you? Did..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, I have something to clarify with him. Look after the store," Kyla hurriedly said to her mother, scared that her mother would figure out what had happened last night if Martin Weiss continued speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn nodded at that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla walked up to Martin Weiss. "Alright, let's talk about whatever we have to say somewhere else. Get your car out of here. I don't want to be the talk of the neighborhood."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two of them got into the car, and Martin Weiss started driving. However, Kyla did not expect him to drive toward the hotel she sent him to last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She stiffened as she looked at the hotel&rsquo;s entrance with a complicated look in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Won't you go in? Didn't you say you wanted to clarify some things with me?" said Martin Weiss. With that said, he took the lead and entered the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla bit her lip slightly and eventually followed him inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The room was as it was last night. She could tell Martin Weiss did not let anyone clean it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There seemed to be a lingering amorousness surrounding the messy covers on the bed and in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss turned to Kyla and said, "We both know exactly what happened last night, don't we? I got drunk yesterday. You could have ignored me, but you sent me here anyway. Kyla, you don't hate me that much, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said as he moved closer and closer to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She backed away until her back was against the wall. "Martin Weiss, I regret taking you here," she said as she glared at him.</p></div>
