        <h1>Chapter 3967</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as he was about to get up and go to the next room to take a cold shower, his body suddenly froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because her fingers had unknowingly grabbed onto his clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bent down and carefully tried to pull her fingers apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her muffled voice suddenly sounded, "Forgive me...please...you must...forgive me..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't help but smile. She still had her eyes closed, obviously still in a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did she dream about that made her say such things even in her sleep?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I forgive you," he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she, as if hearing him, gradually loosened her grip. Her slightly furrowed brow also relaxed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her sleep, Nancy felt an unprecedented sense of peace enveloping her, making her want to sleep forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was a gentle voice whispering in her ear, assuring her that no matter what mistakes she made, he would forgive her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she didn't need to worry about anything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time Nancy woke up, it was almost evening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After dining at Mick's villa, she insisted on returning to her rental room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's fine if you live here. And if you have any concerns, I can also publicly announce that you are my girlfriend," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy suddenly widened her eyes, "Girl...girlfriend?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't we in a relationship now?" Mick asked with a smile. "Since we are in a relationship, you are naturally my girlfriend."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...can we not make it public yet?" she hesitated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brows at her words, "You don't want to make it public? What are your concerns?" If it were any other woman, they would probably want to make it public.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to...wait a bit longer before making it public. And if...by then, you still want me to be your girlfriend..." she said anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she confesses everything to him, if he still wants to forgive her at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, do you think I will change my mind?" Jasper chuckled lightly. "Nancy, I am not someone who easily falls for someone, so I won't easily change my mind either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, he took her hand and lowered his head to kiss her palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as you don't change your mind, I won't either." His cold voice was so powerful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was his promise to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back in her rental room, Nancy looked at her mother's portrait hanging on the wall, feeling heavy-hearted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Mick dropped her off and left, she was alone in her rental room again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, Clarissa is in jail now, so you can rest assured. I finally fulfilled my promise to you and made Clarissa pay for what she did. But...Mom...was what I did wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A low murmuring voice echoed in the quiet rental room as Nancy chuckled bitterly, "From the beginning, I was using Mick because I couldn't make Clarissa pay on my own! But Mick really helped me, and yet... Mom, deceiving someone really isn't a good feeling. I deceived Mick by telling him I liked him. If I tell him everything, will he still forgive me? Or... will he destroy me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only the photos on the wall continued to smile gently at the beloved daughter, but they couldn't provide any answers.</span></p></div>
