        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But at this moment, when he looked at his girlfriend wearing such a gorgeous dress, what Sean was thinking about in his mind was the scene from last night and Jason and Grace's faces.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Had Jason seen him? There had been a second where Jason stared knowingly into the darkness.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Had all of that really happened?!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even at this moment, Sean felt that everything he had seen last night was like a dream. Could it really be that the most powerful and influential and wealthy man in the entire city was slumming it with his ex-fiancee who&rsquo;d murdered Jason Reed&rsquo;s first love, and got convicted for it!?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In what world was this even possible??</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at her fianc&eacute;'s absent-minded expression, Lily frowned. "What's wrong with you? You have been zoning out a lot in the last two days. If you don't want to get engaged to me, just say it."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean sighed and then quickly smiled and said, "Of course not. Why wouldn't I want to get engaged to you? You know that my heart is only for you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Only for me?" Lily raised an eyebrow. "You really have no more feelings for Grace?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean's body stiffened slightly. Lily was sharp. And she could be cruel. He said uncomfortably, &rdquo;Why did you mention her again? I broke up with her years ago. How could I still have feelings for her?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Well then why did you want to help her find a job before?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I just pity her," Sean replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What is there to pity about her? You should pity my sister. Because of Grace, she lost her life," Lily snorted coldly. "If you dare to &lsquo;pity&rsquo; her again when Jason Reed looks for you in the future, you'd better not blame our family for not supporting you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean's reaction was a bit delayed as he thought through all the possible scenarios for his ex&mdash;and her new&hellip; acquaintance. Before, he wouldn't have thought that there was anything wrong with his current girlfriend's words. But now... the existence of Grace might not be all it seemed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After hesitating for a while, he said tentatively, "Lily, do you know if Jason has gotten involved with a new woman recently?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Lily immediately denied. "Jason is notorious for keeping his distance from women. He&rsquo;s as cold as ice and it was a miracle that Jennifer thawed his cold heart&mdash;and that she presented the only suitable partner for marriage.&rdquo; From the way she said it, it was obvious that Lily too saw the former engagement to her sister as nothing more than a strategic alliance between two wealthy families. &ldquo;Jason Reed has not had any other women for the past three years!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was for this reason that the outside world thought that Jason loved her sister deeply, but only the Atkinson family knew that it was not the case.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the Atkinson family would not take the initiative to expose that kind of misunderstanding. On the contrary, they even hoped that others would misunderstand more. It upped their value. Under the umbrella of the Reed Family, the Atkinson family could get more benefits from them all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean heard Lily&rsquo;s words and said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the two of them had finished trying on their clothes and walked out of the dress shop, a car drove up in front of the two. Sean and Lily both knew the person who got it. It was Jason's personal secretary, Terrence Klein.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Secretary Klein, why are you here?" Lily asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Sean was stiff, and there was a hunch in his heart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence smiled slightly, "I'm here to invite Mr. Stevens to a meeting." Then, his eyes turned to Sean. &rdquo;Mr. Stevens, Mr. Reed wants to see you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His hunch was correct! Sean exhaled a long breath. "Okay, I'll go see Mr. Reed with you.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t reflect on how Terrence knew exactly where they were or how he&rsquo;d timed it perfectly to intercept them as they left the store.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Babe, what's going on?" Lily demanded.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean started toward the car. &ldquo;We will discuss it, if it pertains to you when I come back."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After he'd finished speaking, he got into the car with Terrence.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily sputtered, but what could she say? The invitation had been clear and extended only to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean settled into the car and did not look back.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As Terrence pulled into traffic, Sean asked haltingly, "Secretary Klein, do you know why Mr. Reed wants to meet me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence met his gaze in the rearview mirror. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re about to find out&hellip;&rdquo;</p></div>
