        <h1>Chapter 2660</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did President Hart ask Gloria to star in the film because of Valda Theller?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If that's the case, what&rsquo;s President Hart's relationship with Valda Theller?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, Raymond Bowman was looking at the trending news on his phone as well. His expression was ghastly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The media mentioned what had happened at school but did not mention his name in the news. However, Valda's name appeared in the trending news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why did they expose this? Who on earth exposed this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Only a small number of people bullied and called Valda names in school back then. Most of the students only looked on and had no idea what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The person who exposed it is probably among the people who knew what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'In other words, someone's jealous of Valda's achievements and wants to destroy Valda using this method.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who is it? Who on earth is it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman filtered through the possible list of people in his head. Just then, his phone rang, and he answered it. He heard his best friend Chang Mingyu's voice. "Raymond Bowman, have you seen the latest video about Valda Theller online?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No. Why?" Raymond Bowman's uneasiness intensified suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There were a lot of reporters at Valda Theller's studio. They surrounded Valda Theller to interview her," said Chang Mingyu.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Raymond Bowman was so shocked that he almost sprang up from his chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I feel sorry for Valda Theller. Why did someone expose the incident that happened years ago? Besides, I think those reporters are all up to no good. They surrounded Valda Theller, saying that she was also a bully!" Chang Mingyu was aware of the matter back then and knew that Valda Theller did nothing wrong. It was all his best friend and another woman's fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman ended the call gloomily. He found the video Chang Mingyu mentioned on his phone. When he saw the pale Valda Theller surrounded by a group of reporters and being asked malicious questions, he felt a tightness in his chest. His heart felt a sudden pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all these years, she was still affected by the incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all his fault. He was the bully!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers caressed the helpless figure on the screen. "Valda, I looked on and did nothing for you back then, but not this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, he would protect her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman used his connections and money to get someone to suppress the trending posts, but he was informed that someone had removed them earlier than he did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They figured that the person who acted earlier than Raymond Bowman must have spent a lot of money to remove the posts so forcefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who could it be? Who else would do that for Valda?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman thought of Camille Strickland but denied it immediately. Even though Camille Strickland would want to help Valda Theller, she did not have the ability or money. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could it be someone from the film crew? Valda Theller's news would harm the film. Understandably, the producer or the other investors would want to suppress the trending posts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But would they be so quick to spend so much money to protect Valda Theller? After all, no one can spend that much money so casually. They&rsquo;d need time to weigh the pros and cons beforehand.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the man Valda Theller called her boyfriend flashed through Raymond Bowman's mind!</p></div>
