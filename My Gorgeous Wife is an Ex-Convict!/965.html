        <h1>Chapter 964</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The child's mother is Kyla." His deep baritone voice uttered the last thing Paisley Daniels wanted to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A child! Kyla has Martin's child and it&rsquo;s a son too! Therefore... Kyla didn't lie when she said she was pregnant? It wasn't a lie to get out of jail?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels was filled with resentment at the thought of this. If she had known, she would have done something to get rid of the child when Kyla was in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her face hid the hatred and jealousy she was feeling. "She gave birth to your child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry," Martin Weiss said apologetically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's nothing to be sorry about. It's... It's not like I can conceive. At least you have a child to carry on your bloodline," Paisley Daniels lowered her eyes gently and said in a choked voice, "Martin, since you have a child with her, will you be with her... I&hellip; I would understand if this is your decision&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels seemed to have reached a breaking point and stopped speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss raised his hand and held her in his arms. "I won't be with Kyla. I just wanted to ask if you&rsquo;d be willing to raise this child with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can... Can I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why not? You're the future Mrs. Ye."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would Kyla be willing?" Paisley Daniels asked worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scene of that woman clutching his arm and begging him appeared in Martin Weiss&rsquo;s mind once more. He immediately held Paisley Daniels tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop thinking about it. Stop thinking about Kyla!' He kept telling himself this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Paisley's the one I should repay in this life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The person I love should also be Paisley.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whether she likes it or not, I'm going to get the child's custody!" said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels leaned in Martin Weiss's arms and whispered, "Martin, I'll be a good mother and raise the child well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the glimmer in her eyes showed the contrary. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace told Lina about Nelson's kindergarten issue, and Lina immediately said, "I'll ask around and see if there's anyone who knows a kindergarten to see if there's anything we can do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thanks," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing. Speaking of which, I'd like to meet the boy. I'll see him when I have the chance," said Lina. Although she had never met Kyla and Nelson, she often heard about them from her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially from what she heard about Nelson from her best friend, Lina thought he sounded like a child prodigy. How could a deaf child master language so quickly and even recite tongue twisters perfectly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, some regular four-year-old might not even speak so fluently! They would probably mumble if you asked them to sing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her best friend had played her a recording of Nelson saying tongue twisters previously. If she never told her, Lina could never imagine that he was a deaf child who only picked up the language less than a year ago!</p></div>
