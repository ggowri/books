        <h1>Chapter 1714</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked up to the man who had protected her. 'He's the one in pain, isn't he? He became a human cushion!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I'm fine," she said quickly. She saw that his face was unusually pale and his brows were furrowed as though he was suppressing his pain. A thin layer of sweat had also broken out on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina hurriedly got up. "Are you... okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson gasped a little. "I'm fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina stretched out her hand to help Hadwin Stephenson to get up, but he glanced at her hand before looking at her face. "If you don't feel that way about me, don't touch me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I'm just trying to help you to get up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's not necessary," he said as he staggered to his feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, how are you?" Anthony Sherman rushed over and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm alright. I'm not hurt," said Lina. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It's just that... What about Hadwin Stephenson? Is he okay? I even fell on top of him after that fall... Is he really okay?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, Anthony Sherman said to Hadwin Stephenson, "Mr. Stephenson, thank you for saving Lina just now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson raised an eyebrow and seemed to speak with sarcasm, "Are you thanking me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, I'm thanking you. Is there a problem?" said Anthony Sherman as he met Hadwin Stephenson's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes darkened, and his face seemed to be covered with a layer of gloom. However, Anthony Sherman met his eyes calmly without even dodging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the end, it was Hadwin Stephenson who looked away first. He looked at Holly Greer, who was still standing at the top of the escalator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His cold gaze made Holly Greer, who was still standing at the same spot, suddenly come to her senses. She frantically shook her hands and said, "I... I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it..." With that, she escaped without looking back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That darn Holly Greer! She didn't mean it? She went too far!" Lina snapped, but how could she catch up to Holly Greer now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The mall has surveillance cameras. Report it to the police and ask them to check the surveillance footage. The woman won&rsquo;t be able to escape this," said Anthony Sherman. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson turned around without saying a word, intending to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Wait!" Lina tried to grab Hadwin Stephenson almost subconsciously, but he avoided her by turning away slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I told you. If you don't feel that way about me, don't touch me!" Hadwin Stephenson said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I just want to make sure you're okay," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson suddenly chortled. "What if I said I'm not okay? What will you do then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina froze, and Hadwin Stephenson left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Stephenson probably still loves you. Otherwise, he wouldn't have saved you like that." Anthony Sherman's voice rang out casually. Lina bit her lip, her heart filled with an unspeakable feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Does he love me? Maybe. Maybe it's just like what he told me&hellip; He never loved Katherine Jackson and has loved me all along.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she dared not love him again. Five years had taken away her courage and recklessness. She had more things to care about now. She did not want her elderly parents to worry about her and just wanted to live a peaceful life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, the mall's security guard came and asked Lina and Anthony Sherman, "Were you the one pushed down the escalator just now? Are you hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No." Lina shook her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
