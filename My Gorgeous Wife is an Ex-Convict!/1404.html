        <h1>Chapter 1403</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had collected the relevant evidence and was planning to tell Martin Weiss the truth in two days&hellip; It was only a few days away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was only a few days away yet this happened!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had gotten a call from Nelson earlier today and quickly asked Jay to look into the matter only to find out that Kyla had been brought to this hospital. God knew what they would have done to Kyla if she had not come in time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, tell me. If Martin Weiss did love Kyla, how could he do such a cruel thing to a woman he once loved?" murmured Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason gently held Grace's face. "Stop being upset. I'll have someone protect Kyla Corbyn. At least, I won't let Martin Weiss and the Daniels family do anything to her again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "I'm just furious. Why won't Martin Weiss show Kyla any mercy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No one with a shred of pity would have done such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You've told him about the bone marrow donation today. Once he finds out the truth, he's probably going to live in regret for the rest of his life," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Regret?" Grace sneered, "But regret is too light a punishment for him. Look at how much pain and humiliation he has caused Kyla! He even ruined Kyla's life! What can his regret atone for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason suddenly stiffened, and he looked down slightly, covering the pain that flashed in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Didn't you hope that Martin Weiss could donate his liver to Kyla Corbyn? At least, he would be willing to donate his liver if he regretted it," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was silent. Kyla had a unique blood type. She might not get a suitable liver if she wanted to wait for a liver from the hospital. It would naturally be the most convenient and fastest way if Martin Weiss was willing to donate his liver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Especially... now that Kyla's illness was deteriorating and the situation had gotten more urgent. She needed a liver transplant surgery as soon as possible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then let Martin Weiss atone to Kyla. He owes Kyla a life, so he'll pay her with one," muttered Grace. Then, she looked at Jason again and said, "Jay, I don't want to let Paisley Daniels off. She has gone too far."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Had it not been for Paisley Daniels, even if Martin Weiss and Kyla had a family feud, Kyla would not have been reduced to such a miserable state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay. Paisley Daniels won't be able to enjoy her life for long," replied Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Also, ask your men to send something to Martin Weiss for me," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What is it?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"A USB flash drive with two recordings," said Grace as she pressed her red lips together. She wanted Martin Weiss to listen to the two recordings with his own ears and listen to how Kyla had saved his life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss's heart had never been so flustered. Even when the Weiss family was in trouble due to the near destruction of the empire his ancestors founded and his parents were worriedly asking for help everywhere, he had still believed he could revive the Weiss family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Later, he was diagnosed with a blood disorder and was dying. He had been scared when someone refused to donate their bone marrow to him, but... even then he had never been so flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, his heart was now in a frenzy. Even his head was in a mess with Grace's words repeating in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Whose words should I believe? Grace or Paisley?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he had asked Paisley, the flicker of guilt in Paisley's eyes and the slight unease of the Daniels family members had given him a vague answer.</p></div>
