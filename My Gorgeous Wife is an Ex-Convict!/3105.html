        <h1>Chapter 3103</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda bit her lip and said, "Brian, I know you mean well, but a house is a big thing and I can buy it myself. I don't want to take advantage of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really want to distance yourself from me like this?" he said unhappily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just want to rely on myself," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille saw that the atmosphere was getting tense and quickly said, "Alright, alright, let's stop talking about it. Let's order some food! This restaurant is a popular internet-famous restaurant lately, and some of the dishes are quite thoughtful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go to the restroom first," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Would you like me to accompany you?" Camille said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need," Valda smiled and said, "I can go to the bathroom by myself. You don't have to accompany me for the rest of my life, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Camille didn't say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that Valda's limp made her more self-conscious and eager to be treated like an ordinary person, rather than someone who needed special attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda left the restaurant and headed towards the restroom in the mall. Camille kept looking at Brian, her gaze following her friend's figure until Valda turned the corner and disappeared from sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille asked, "Why did you almost argue with Valda just now? Don't you want her to buy a house?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I hope she can live better instead of struggling to save money to buy a house," said Brian. He wants to give her everything he can, but unfortunately, she doesn't want to accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you want her to have a better life, why not respect her decision first? Sometimes, respect is more important than giving. " said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's eyes flickered slightly upon hearing this, as if he was pondering something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, about Valda, she's someone who responds better to kindness than force. If you really want to help her open up, try being gentle first. You never know, it might lead to some unexpected progress."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian bit his lip and said, "Regarding Valda's house purchase, if she needs money, I'll give it to you and you can use your name to give it to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Camille's head immediately began to ache. "Please don't do this, big brother. If this matter is exposed, Valda will think that I am colluding with you to hide it from her. It will be a huge blow to our friendship. If you want to lend her money, just ask her directly. If she feels embarrassed to ask, I can persuade her. I promise you will become her creditor!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian was slightly amused by Camille's words, "Okay, sure, let's do it like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, he glanced at the time. It had been about ten minutes, but Valda still hadn't returned, which made him a little worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille also said, "Hey, why hasn't Valda come back yet? Maybe I should go check on her." As she spoke, she began to get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go." Brian stood up and walked straight towards the exit of the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Valda just came out of the restroom and was immediately blocked by a crowd of people outside, making it impossible for her to leave.</p></div>
