        <h1>Chapter 2225</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing to do with you? You're pregnant with his baby, yet you say you have nothing to do with him? It's alright if you don't want to help, but why would you lie?" Jacqueline Bowman snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, another car pulled up to the store&rsquo;s entrance. Grace got out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jacqueline Bowman saw that someone was here, she frowned and said, "Forget it. I'll come and see you again when I'm free." Then, she left in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked past Jacqueline Bowman and walked up to Kyla. "Who is that person? A friend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said with a faint smile, "We're not really friends. She's a former inmate. She was kind to me when I was in prison. I met her by chance a few days ago, but I found that she only wanted to use me to get to know Martin Weiss for business. She didn&rsquo;t really want to catch up with me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sighed. "People are complicated. Sometimes, you'll meet someone okay, but other times, you&rsquo;ll find that they&rsquo;re not that great."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, people are complicated. Besides, people will change over the years," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is she the same person who helped you erase your tracks and avoid Martin Weiss's radar after you were released from prison?" Grace asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." Kyla shook her head. "That person... is my true savior. If it hadn't been for her, maybe Nelson and I would be worse off now. She was released earlier than me. I don't know why she ended up in prison, but I think with her ability, she&rsquo;ll be fine after getting out. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had wanted to meet that person all these years but it did not happen. She had no way of asking around either. Though that person had helped her out so much at the time, she only knew her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If it's meant to be, then you'll meet each other sooner or later," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope so." Kyla smiled. "By the way, why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm here to give you your invitation card!" said Grace as she took out a party invitation card from her bag. "I just came from Lina's place. Tina's almost one month old, and they want to hold her a full moon celebration. Lina and Hadwin Stephenson have only received a marriage license. They haven&rsquo;t held a wedding party yet. Hadwin Stephenson wants to hold a grand full moon celebration to officially announce Lina's status once again, lest the tabloids make up some rumors."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is&hellip; Is there a dress code for the party?" asked Kyla. After all, she did not have any formal dresses. She would make a fool of herself if she attended in her regular clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew what Kyla was worried about and said, "Why don't you and Nelson come look for me on that day before going to the party? I'll get you both dressed for the party!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's too much trouble!" Kyla said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How are you any trouble? I'm your best friend and Nelson's godmother! I'll get upset if you're treating me a stranger," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's heart melted, and she stopped rejecting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, I saw the boy from the Hunter family again when I left Lina's place," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He went over to Lina's place again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace muttered, "Yeah, Lina said that the child would visit Tina once or twice a week. That child seems to really care about Tina. I wonder why he's so interested in Tina? Tina is just a baby right now. What's so special about her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, the boy from the Hunter family would not say why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll find out in the future. At least, the child means Tina no harm for now," said Kyla.</p></div>
