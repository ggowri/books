        <h1>Chapter 2794</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"God will arrange for you to meet someone who&rsquo;ll love you very much,&rdquo; her gentle voice said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He trembled as his eyelashes quivered slightly. Then, he slowly looked up. His phoenix eyes saw her face that was pretty, cute, and amiable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her expression was so serious. Those round eyes showed concern and... a more intense feeling for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you love me?" His thin lips muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." She was honest and did not shy away from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How much do you love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know how much I love you, but I want to be with you. I'm willing to do everything I can for that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I never fall for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said softly, "Then I won't force you. I'll only regret that I couldn't make you love me, so I&rsquo;ll love you very much until then. I'll love you until you feel that my love has become a burden for you. I&rsquo;ll put away my love when that happens so it won't affect you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark phoenix eyes stared at the person in front of him as if something had touched his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was confessing her love for him with such an expression. The surge of bitterness in his heart seemed to fade away...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then try to make me fall for you, okay?" he murmured as he leaned forward and rested his lips on hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes widened instantly. 'He's... kissing me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's not acting or doing it for show. He just wanted to... kiss me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He closed his eyes and gradually lengthened the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The touch of her soft lips was like an analgesic, easing the pain in his heart. It turned out that kissing felt so good, calm, and heart-melting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After an unknown amount of time, Brian finally ended the kiss. "Love me and don't give up halfway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had an intuition that this woman in front of him might be the one to pull him out of the abyss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." Valda Theller heard herself saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could say that Kyla's press conference knocked down the rumors of her and Martin Weiss's marital crisis and explained Martin Weiss's physical condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss donated his liver to his wife twice, so others could definitely see his love for his wife. Therefore, they suddenly started talking about Martin Weiss's loyalty. In many women's opinions, he suddenly became a loving man willing to do everything and risk his life for his wife instead of a &lsquo;suspected&rsquo; cheater.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the press conference, Weiss Group's share price stopped falling and skyrocketed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could say that the press conference was a success.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss turned livid after watching the video of the press conference. After hearing what Kyla said to the reporters, his lips even tightened into a line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who arranged the press conference?" Martin Weiss asked coldly. Kyla could not have arranged such a press conference by herself.</p></div>
