        <h1>Chapter 3775</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Jasper immediately laughed and said, "Oh, that's great! Mason, you'll have to rely on Sister Veronica from now on. By the way, when are you free next? How about the four of us go on a date together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Together?" Veronica was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's more fun to hang out with more people!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked at Mason. Although she didn't mind going on a date together, would </span><span>he be against it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if guessing what she was thinking, Mason said, "Let's do it together then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, that's great! We'll go on a date together, take some photos, and send them to our big brother to tease him. He's the only one who's still single now," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Jasper's worried expression, William was relieved. At least now, Jasper wouldn't think about the time when Lawrence forcibly kissed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as for Lawrence, he wouldn't let this matter go. He had to get justice for Jasper!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing their meal, Veronica received a call from Daniel, saying that there was something urgent at the company and she needed to come back to help.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Today is your day off, and you don't have any classes, right? You can come over, and the supervisor needs the documents urgently," Daniel said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I see. Alright, I'll come over," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, by the way, where are you now? Do you want me to come pick you up?" Daniel asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Veronica didn't have a chance to speak before Mason took her phone and said to the other end, "I'll take her there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the call ended, Veronica looked at Mason and said, "You're taking me to the company."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise? Let you take the subway by yourself?" Mason asked back. "Let's go!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica said goodbye to Jasper and William, and obediently got into Mason's car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the car drove towards Veronica's agency, when they were close to the company's entrance, Veronica said, "Just stop by the roadside."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't need to send me to the company entrance?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, if you really send me to the entrance, it will attract too much attention. I'm just a small assistant. If it's too eye-catching, it's not good. You know, our company is an agency for celebrities, and there are paparazzi following us." Veronica explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Mason didn't insist. "I'll come to pick you up when you're done."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, I can take the subway back by myself. It's a waste of time for you to come and pick me up." Veronica said. "Then...how about waiting for me in my apartment? Of course, if you have time, you can cook some dishes for me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Knowing that he studied abroad and could cook by himself, she really wanted to taste his cooking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason looked at Veronica, and on her face, there was a certain expectation, and her eyes were shining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at her expression, it made him have the impulse to agree to all her requests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Mason said, "Then I'll wait for you in your apartment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Veronica smiled and got out of the car, watching Mason drive away. Meanwhile, in a taxi not far away, Daniel was staring at this scene with a gloomy face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Veronica walked towards the company, suddenly she heard footsteps behind her, and then someone tapped her on the shoulder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was startled and turned her head to see Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you let Mason take you to the company entrance? Wouldn't that be more </span><span>convenient?" Daniel asked.</span></p></div>
