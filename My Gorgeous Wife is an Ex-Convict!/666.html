        <h1>Chapter 665</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sat in the car, watching the scenery receding on both sides. She began to hum softly. A beautiful and soothing song filled the air in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly and waited until Grace had finished singing before asking, "What&rsquo;s this song?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Strolling Down the Path of Life. It&rsquo;s an old song. My grandmother loved listening to it. She was the one who taught me to sing it. I used to sing it for fun when I was a kid. I didn't understand much of the lyrics back then, but the older I grew, the more I understand them," answered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's indeed a good song," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, too bad Grandma can't teach me any more songs," she murmured, looking exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had only slept for three to four hours a day. She spent most of her time beside her grandmother's refrigerated coffin or was busy with funeral affairs, so she did not have time to sleep properly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get some shut-eye if you're tired. It's a two-hour drive back," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace responded, and Jason helped her to adjust her seat to the right angle for a comfortable nap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She leaned her head back in the chair and closed her eyes, falling asleep after a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared at her sleeping face and took out a small silver bracelet from his chest pocket a moment later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The silver bracelet was identical to the little silver bracelet Brian carried with him. They were a set.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One was with Brian while the other was in a box of belongings that Old Mrs. Lu left for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she was admitted to the hospital, Old Mrs. Lu had given it to a close friend for safekeeping. She told her friend that if she died, the contents were to be given to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What an old woman in a small town left in a box was of course nothing of value. They were just some jewelry that Grace's late mother left to Old Mrs. Lu, and she added some of her own jewelry for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This small silver bracelet was also among the pile of jewelry, looking a little out of place among the others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had taken the bracelet beforehand. He was afraid that she would overthink it if she saw the bracelet. The last thing he wanted was for her to remember her past with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that Stella Lindsay had taken Grace's place and was found by Brian, it was probably the perfect ending to the affair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stroked the cold silver bracelet gently, his long eyelashes covering the conspiracy in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always achieved his goals by hook or by crook. He never thought there was anything wrong with his approach to things, but often in the face of Grace&rsquo;s trusting eyes, he would be left with a heavy heart. Even breathing would become increasingly difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't blame it on me, Grace," he said these five words silently as he clenched the little silver bracelet tightly in his palm&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Were you brought here by bad guys? Then I'll get you out of here before they catch you again." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This childish voice sounds like my voice when I was a child... No, it is my voice.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little girl who looked eight or nine years old was wearing a floral dress and was obviously her when she was a child!</p></div>
