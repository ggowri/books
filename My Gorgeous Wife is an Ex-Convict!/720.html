        <h1>Chapter 719</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the way she looked right now... Without looking at herself in the mirror, Grace knew that her appearance right now would cause the servants to misunderstand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was burning terribly now, and her lips were almost numb from the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason went into the bedroom with Grace in his arms and lay her straight on the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His long fingers began to unbutton his tie, his suit jacket...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace struggled to sit up in bed. "Jason, listen to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, say it. I'll listen,&rdquo; he said darkly. However, his fingers began to unbutton the shirt underneath, and his eyes, which were looking at her, had an inconcealable desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face, which had turned red in the car, turned even redder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suddenly knew what he was going to do next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was more important to clear things up first!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I used the wrong word when I said lifeline. What I really meant was that it was an emergency, so I grabbed... Grabbed his hand..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice trailed off as she spoke, for he had stripped off his top and exposed his wiry chest...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He walked right up to her, leaned forward, and supported his hands on the edge of the bed. Staring at her, he said, "Whether you used the wrong word or if it was an emergency, I'm the only person in this world who can be your lifeline!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned, only feeling she was getting entangled in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you hear me?" His face came even closer to hers, his warm breath spraying onto her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I heard you..." She almost could not help answering him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he smiled slightly. The smile was so charming that he took her hand which had red marks on it. "Don't hold Brian with this hand again, all right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was in a daze as she watched his thin lips open and close, saying...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, you're mine. I can't stand the sight of you holding another man's hand so tightly like that." She had held him so tightly that he felt that she would still be holding on to him even if the bones in her fingers ached terribly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you... Jealous?" murmured Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised the corners of his mouth, grabbed her hand, and pressed it against his lips. His sexy thin lips kissed the red marks on her wrists as he murmured, "Yes, I'm jealous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm mad with jealousy.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if in fear, the jealousy grew. He even wanted to cut off Brian's hand at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more he loved her, the more jealous he became.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was enough to suffocate himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't need to be jealous of anything. I love you, no one else," she said, not wanting the slightest misunderstanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How much do you love me?" His voice was uniquely hoarse, causing people to get lost in it gradually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Very much, Jay. I want to grow old with you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, she felt his hand unzipping her dress from the back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face became redder, and even her skin was tinged with a faint pink, but... She did not try to stop him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the silver dress came off her body, her fair skin against the ruby necklace made her look even more delicate.</p></div>
