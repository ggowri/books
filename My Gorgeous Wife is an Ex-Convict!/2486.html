        <h1>Chapter 2484</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I can help the Mitchell family this time, but it depends on the Mitchell family whether you succeed," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell looked happy. As long as George Gregory was willing to help, things would turn around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George, as long as you help the Mitchell family this time, the Mitchell family will never forget your kindness. When our two companies merge, the Mitchell family can cede more interests to the Gregory family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory was unamused by Louise Mitchell's statement. No amount of profit was good enough for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His ability to be happy had already vanished after the car accident back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell did not expect George Gregory to take the initiative to meet her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the private room of a club in Deer City, she met George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was a buzz in Amber Mitchell's ears. Confusion flashed across her face after she stepped into the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sitting in a chair, George Gregory explained indifferently, "It only affects the electronic devices you carry around with you by temporarily disabling them. Once you leave the room, the devices will return to normal. I just don't want conversations in this room to be recorded."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Will our conversation be embarrassing?" Amber Mitchell asked sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory gazed at the woman in front of him. The woman he used to love deeply was now looking at him with hatred in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were only a few steps from each other, but there seemed to be a chasm between them that they could never cross. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've learned that it was indeed the Mitchell family's fault that you were sent to a mental hospital, but we can't go back in time. Why don't we talk about compensation now?" George Gregory said, looking as though he was negotiating a business deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Compensation?" Amber Mitchell burst into laughter. "Are you saying you want to give me compensation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;ll only cause the Mitchell family trouble if this goes on. It&rsquo;ll bring no benefit to you. Your shares have long since been diluted and transferred away. You should think about how to get enough money to move on from this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell suddenly found the man in front of her unfamiliar. It was as if she had never known him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she had never known him to begin with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's voice continued to ring in her ears. "I can get the Mitchell family to return the rest of your shares and give you another one hundred million dollars as compensation. Meanwhile, you can go abroad or stay in Deer City. If you go abroad, your accommodation and necessities will be provided. If you stay in Deer City, I can buy you a mansion, which will be better than the simple rental house you&rsquo;re staying in now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you want me to do? You're not giving me these benefits for free, are you?" She looked at him indifferently.</p></div>
