        <h1>Chapter 434</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Judy Dixon never guessed was that the woman whom she assumed would go all bonkers did not even say a word. Instead, she merely looked at her calmly. The man she was interested in spoke first. &ldquo;Scram!&rdquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Judy Dixon widened her eyes in disbelief. This was the first time someone ever used such a word at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You...&rdquo; Judy Dixon&rsquo;s face reddened from embarrassment while Jason pulled Grace along into the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Judy Dixon wanted to follow them into the elevator, but when she saw the icy cold stare Jason gave her, her body shuddered and her feet seemed to have grown root. She was unable to move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only after the elevator door closed that Judy Dixon&rsquo;s friend, Jillian Waters, no longer held back her tongue. &ldquo;This man has such poor taste. Does he know how to speak properly!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Judy Dixon gritted her teeth in hatred. She had never been mocked by anyone before. All these while, she was always the jewel in someone&rsquo;s hand. She had never received such ill-treatment!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at the elevator that was heading down before stopping on the first floor. She quickly pulled Jillian Waters to take the other elevator to the first floor as well. They quickly chased across to see the pair heading toward the nearby parking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Judy Dixon said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive the car over. You help me keep an eye on them.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Oh, okay...&rdquo; Jillian Waters said. They might be good friends, but the Yan family was a stronger family than hers. Judy Dixon was the princess of the Yan family. Therefore, Jillian Waters was more accurately known as Judy Dixon&rsquo;s underling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Judy Dixon hurried over to where her car was parked and drove out. She wanted to tail the couple to their home. Once she had their address, it would be a breeze to find out their identities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was going to snatch the man from that woman and make the man regret his earlier words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Judy Dixon drove out, she received a call from Jillian Waters. She drove over to where Jillian Waters was. The latter then swiftly got into the car and said to Judy Dixon, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that Bentley in front. They got in that car.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Judy Dixon was rather stunned as she looked at the Bentley that was not too far away. It was waiting at the traffic light. &lsquo;They got in that car?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t get it wrongly, did you? That car?&rdquo; Judy Dixon read the car number plate that she saw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that car.&rdquo; Jillian Waters nearly wanted to raise her hand to make an oath to prove that she had not seen it wrongly. &ldquo;Both of them got into that car.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Judy Dixon&rsquo;s expression fell. She had seen many luxury cars. If it was a regular luxury car, she would not be too shocked, but that was a limited edition car that cost a few million. Plus, you may not get it even if you had the money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;This couple has such a car? No, it probably belongs to the man. That woman does not look like someone who can afford this car.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Judy Dixon continued to tail the Bentley. Regardless, she was going to find out the identity of that man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the other car, Jason looked at his rearview mirror and realized that he was being tailed. He stopped at the traffic light and called a number. He immediately said, &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s tailing my car. A white BMW, car number plate...&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace, who was in the passenger seat, was shocked to hear that. &ldquo;There is a car tailing us?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I think so. They&rsquo;ve been following us for some time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;So, you gave a call to...&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;The head of the traffic police department.&rdquo;</p></div>
