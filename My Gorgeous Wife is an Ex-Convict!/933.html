        <h1>Chapter 932</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt as if something was suffocating his chest, making him unable to breathe at the sight of her red and swollen cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Earlier today when he opened the car door and saw her lying there with her hands tied and her cheeks red and swollen, he had felt the urge to kill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person he treasured and wanted to protect had been harmed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip but did not cry out at all. After all, she was used to not crying out because it never worked even if she did!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason did not say anything and only prepared the ointment before applying it on her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In addition to the wounds on her face, she also got kicked several times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll do it myself," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You won't be able to apply it on your back," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you find it awkward, I'll apply it with my eyes closed. The doctor wrote the approximate position of your injuries in the examination report," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. Before she knew it, he had walked up to her back, closed his eyes, and reached out to lift her top.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" She let out a cry of surprise. Then, she heard him say, "Don't move. I can't find the exact position if you move."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, she felt his fingers on her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He touched the spot where she was experiencing a dull pain at the moment. The ointment the doctor prescribed for her contained mint, and it sent a cool sensation running down her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her back felt as though it was getting hotter and hotter. It was as though her blood was rushing to where his fingers were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After applying the ointment on her back, Grace's skin seemed as if it had been stained pink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hurriedly pulled her clothes down. "A-Alright."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason opened his eyes slowly. His long eyelashes were raised like fans. With those gorgeous eyes, he seemed to be able to intrigue people easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're hurt. Don't go to the firm tomorrow. Take a few days off and rest," he said to her as he put the ointment on the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That won't do. It's not as if I can't walk, and there's plenty of work at the office," she said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was only a mere paralegal. How could she just ask for leave and ask for a few days at that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At best... She would be a little more eye-catching tomorrow with her face still swollen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? Do you have to go to work?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Everyone else is going to work, and if I don't, someone else will have to take over my work, adding to their workload," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I see," he said out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What do you see?' Grace was puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the evening, Grace received a call from the firm. It was from the receptionist, informing her that the firm was closed tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Closed?" Grace was stunned. Tomorrow was not a holiday or a memorial day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, closed. The higher-ups informed me without giving any reason for it. They just said to close the firm for three days and see what happens later," the receptionist said. Though it was without any reason, they would still get paid. Who would not like some days off?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing the call, Grace looked blankly at her phone. Somehow, she felt that Jason might have something to do with this.</p></div>
