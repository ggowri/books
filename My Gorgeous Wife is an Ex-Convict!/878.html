        <h1>Chapter 877</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was unknown whether the police would reinvestigate the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll check with the police station again later," said Lawyer Carter as he looked at Grace's dark eye circles. "You've been working hard on the case. You probably haven't been sleeping well. I'll give you the day off. Why don't you go home and have a good rest?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew Lawyer Carter had misunderstood her. While it was true that she had not been sleeping well, it was because of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that it was easier to get along with Lawyer Carter than she thought, which was a relief to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that she had a day off, Grace planned to visit Kyla and Nelson. After all, it would not be long before they left Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect to see a luxury car pulling up in front of the entrance when she reached the ground floor of her office building. A woman dressed in a high-end designer outfit stepped out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Stella!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was somewhat surprised. Stella had now seen her and walked up to her. "Grace, what a coincidence! I was just about to come looking for you and now I&rsquo;ve run into you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella found out about her cousin working here from Curtis Row, the man she saw at the club last time. Grace was now working as a paralegal here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'So what if she was once the most promising rookie lawyer? Isn't she just a little assistant now?' Stella sniggered to herself but continued to put on a show by pretending to display sisterly affection toward Grace. "Have you got a minute? I want to talk to you about something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there anything we need to talk about?" retorted Grace. She and her cousin had been at odds since their childhood. Besides, she had been studying and working in Emerald City since then. You could say that they had little interaction with each other, let alone the so-called sisterhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, of course. If you have any business to attend to that might delay your time, I'll explain it to your firm. I'm sure your firm will not be so unkind as to not give you any time," Stella said smugly. She seemed to think that the firm would surely do so if she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know that this was all thanks to Brian. If one day she could not rely on Brian anymore, she would be nothing to others!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at her cousin's boastful expression and knew that if she did not say yes, she might indeed barge into the firm later on. Therefore, she said, "Alright, let's find a place nearby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a smile on her face, Stella immediately picked out a seemingly upscale cafe nearby and ordered two cups of the most expensive coffee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know you&rsquo;ve broken up with Jason, so you probably don't have much money. It's my treat today. Brian gave me a black card to spend as I please," Stella said ostentatiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was quite speechless when she saw her pretending to enjoy her cappuccino even though she did not like it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered that Stella had always disliked coffee and said that it was like drinking poison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she had ordered coffee and was drinking it reluctantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can order something else," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, the coffee's pretty good. I prefer coffee now," Stella said reluctantly. She disliked coffee but found that many people in high society liked drinking it, so she naturally wanted to drink it too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It made her feel like she was on a higher level!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After taking a few sips of coffee, Stella looked at Grace and said, "Grace, we're cousins after all. I'm sorry you broke up with Jason. If you need any help, just let me know and I'll do my best to help you."</p></div>
