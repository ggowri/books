        <h1>Chapter 2511</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Despicable. If you need women, I can ask around for some in the nightclub. There are women interested in you," she said through clenched teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ignoring her anger, he only said lazily, "Tell me. How would Herman Moss feel if he knew that I had my way with you in this car?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's expression changed. "I'll sue you if you do that! Deer City will learn all about your scandal by then! I think Herman would only feel sorry for me because a monster had its way with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The air in the car tensed suddenly. "Then why don't I try and see if you&rsquo;ll sue me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said as he proceeded to undress her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him coldly but did not resist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Aren&rsquo;t you going to resist me? Is your so-called love for Herman Moss just all talk?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell only said calmly, "I can't fight you if you really want to have your way with me. If I had done everything I wanted to do, I would fight you to the death. But I still have things to do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she could not let anything happen to her. She could not get caught by the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is putting Louise Mitchell, your father, and your stepmother in jail what you want to do? Are you even willing to give up all resistance for this purpose?" He mocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not answer and just slowly closed her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she wanted more than putting all three members of the Mitchell family in jail was to find out who killed Herman. She wanted to give Herman the truth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was in the car with her eyes closed, and underneath her clothes lay a battered body. There was barely a patch of skin intact and countless old wounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory froze. He knew she had been hurt, but he never imagined that she was hurt so badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These injuries stung his eyes. The moment he caught sight of them, his blood seemed to freeze. His heart constricted violently as waves of pain surged within him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"F*ck off! F*ck off!" George Gregory suddenly shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell opened her eyes, hurriedly pulling her clothes together. She rushed out of the car in a fluster. She kept running ahead as if she wanted to escape from the car and the person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory leaned heavily on the back of the chair as he stared blankly at his hands. Then, he clenched his fist and slammed it on the seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why... Why am I so filled with anger but with nowhere to vent? It's so uncomfortable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'And... Why is my heart in so much pain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It hurt when I saw... her wounds!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? The doctors changed their statements?" Amber Mitchell asked as she looked at the lawyer in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." The lawyer was a little frustrated too. "Now, the evidence can only prove that your father and stepmother were involved, but Louise Mitchell had no idea about it. And because of the changes in the statements, your father and stepmother will probably receive a lighter sentence as well. Louise Mitchell... might get acquitted."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell clenched her hands into fists, and the veins on the back of her hands almost burst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Acquitted? No way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How can that vicious woman, Louise Mitchell, go free?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Louise Mitchell not only sent me to the mental hospital, but she was also the one who tortured me...' Amber Mitchell felt a pang at the thought of the evidence she had just discovered.</p></div>
