        <h1>Chapter 295</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A muffled breath now seemed to clog his chest, and he could not get it out or swallow it down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since when could he not bear to see a woman get worried and afraid? She seemed to be the only one who could make him feel that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason heaved a sigh that sounded more like a helpless compromise. He took out his phone and made a call. "Help me find someone. I need to know where this person is, whether she's safe or not... Her name is Lina. She was taken away by a car this afternoon. The car is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said and held out the phone to Grace, beckoning her to talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shuddered and quickly said, "It's a black Maybach, and the license plate number is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly told them the numbers she remembered, the address of the parking lot, the time it happened, and all the other details.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace finished speaking, Jason said to the other end of the phone, "That's all. I want to know where this person is as soon as possible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, Jason looked at Grace. "All right. Can we go back now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She then walked with him to his car. He opened the door to the passenger seat, and once she was seated, he bent down again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She startled. Her body stiffened subconsciously. She only saw his upper body leaning toward her. His handsome face drew closer and closer to her, close enough that she could feel his breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him in bewilderment. Up close, she could see his long lashes and ink-black pupils. She could see the straight curve of his nose, and even the tiny strands of hair on his forehead...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Under the bridge of his nose was his lips. They were undeniably beautiful. His upper lip was slightly thin but was vaguely sexy. When his lips were tightly closed, it gave people a sense of oppression. However, when his lips were slightly raised to smile, people could not help but want to see more of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that a man like him, who was reputed as the last man to mess with in Emerald City, would give people a pure and beautiful feeling when he laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's gaze was fixed on Jason's lip until the seatbelt buckle clicked into place. She suddenly realized that he was fastening her seat belt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you..." she said, a little embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he maintained his position and gazed at her with bright eyes. "What were you thinking when you looked at me so intently?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His breath was fragrant like an orchid, and his warm breath sprinkled her face, causing her to blush helplessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was she thinking... Was she to tell him that she thought he looked good smiling?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She lowered her eyes and avoided his gaze. The next moment, however, his fingers caressed her lips&mdash;right at the place where he had bitten her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It should be all right in a few days. Will you blame me for biting you?" he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"... Thank you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"For biting you?" There was a hint of amusement in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, thank you for helping me find Lina." She took a deep breath, looked up, and looked back into his eyes.</p></div>
