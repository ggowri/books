        <h1>Chapter 3855</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica and Mason's hands remained clasped, even when they saw Daniel being escorted out by the prison guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The current Daniel was very different from the one Veronica remembered. His face was waxen, his hair was shaved into a crew cut, and he was wearing the uniform of the detention center. He looked very gloomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sunny boy from before had finally become like this! Veronica felt a complex emotion that was hard to describe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps back then, she never would have thought that this scene would happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're lucky to be alive. It seems that God really doesn't have eyes," Daniel spoke in a harsh tone. "Are you here to laugh at me or to watch me cry and repent in front of you? Let me tell you, if I do that, it's all because of you. If there's anything I regret, it's not killing you, Veronica, directly at the beginning. That way, when Mason came to save you, he would have only saved a corpse. Wouldn't that have been more fun?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's face changed slightly, and a fierce look flashed in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other hand, Veronica remained calm and unaffected by Daniel's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or perhaps it should be said that Veronica originally thought she would be angry, upset, and heartbroken, but after listening to Daniel's words, she didn't feel anything at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was like being a bystander, just listening to someone complaining about something irrelevant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So it seems that I should still be grateful to you. At least you spared my life back then, so I had the opportunity to resolve the conflict with Mason and be together again," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel's face turned ugly. "Veronica, do you really think that you can live happily ever after with Mason from now on? He is the Mason of the Reed family, and what about you? What kind of background do you have? He is good to you now, but it's only because of the bond you two share from growing up together. He hasn't seen too many women yet. When he gets older and sees more people and faces more temptations, do you think he will still treat you the same way? By then, the person he once risked his life to save will just be a thing of the past to him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's just your own opinion," Veronica said. "Daniel, you always like to speculate about others based on your own thoughts, but you forget that everyone is different. Maybe if you had money and power, you would become like this, but Mason won't!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What makes you think he won't?" Daniel's face twisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you really believe in someone, you don't need a reason," Veronica said. "I trust him, and I trust that he will always be consistent with me. It's that simple."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These words were like a cold slap in the face, hitting Daniel hard, and making him want to pounce on Veronica in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, before he could make a move, the prison guard had already subdued him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Daniel, after today, I think you really have no meaning to me anymore. Let's meet in court in a few days." And after the court, she and Daniel would probably never see each other again in this lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, you will regret it! You will definitely regret trusting Mason in the future!" Even though his body was restrained, Daniel still shouted at Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she ignored Daniel and just said to Mason beside her, "Okay, it's over. Let's go back."</p></div>
