        <h1>Chapter 2776</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, Mr. Hart. Thank you for coming to my birthday party," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian replied, "Hello. Happy birthday to you!" With that said, he also took out a gift and handed it to Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was stunned, not expecting Brian to give her a separate gift. "Valda has already given me a gift. You're her boyfriend. The two of you can just give me one gift. If you got me a gift too, it's as if I invited you here for an extra gift." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're Valda's best friend. Besides, you did her a lot of favors back then, so you deserve the gift," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland smiled sheepishly and glanced at Valda Theller before saying, "Thank you, then." She beckoned Valda Theller and Brian to sit down as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the other birthday party attendees looked at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland only introduced Brian as Valda Theller's boyfriend, Mr. Hart. She did not tell them his identity. After all, everyone would probably be watching him if she did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the crown prince of the entertainment industry. Ordinary folks like them had only heard about him from gossip news of the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland thanked everyone for coming to celebrate her birthday and asked them to enjoy the food and drinks after they took their seats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone knocked on the private room door twice when everyone was about to dig in. Then, several men who looked like security guards pushed the door open and stood on both sides of the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd in the private room was confused but saw the celebrity named Neil slowly walking in with a cake with candles on it while singing happy birthday. The number of candles on the cake reflected Camille Strickland's age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland froze, staring at the scene in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neil appeared in front of her and sang happy birthday to her with a cake... It was almost like a dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Neil stood in front of Camille Strickland, he said, "You must be Camille."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland nodded stiffly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Happy birthday, Camille!" Neil said. His melodious baritone voice was dreamy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you... real?" Camille Strickland asked stupidly. She was still in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course." Neil chuckled. "I came here today to wish you a happy birthday. Here, make a wish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a trance, Camille Strickland closed her eyes and made a wish before blowing out the candles on the cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Neil asked, "Do you have any songs you'd like to hear? I can sing one for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Circles," Camille Strickland said the song title almost subconsciously. It was one of Neil's biggest hits as well as her favorite song.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neil smiled, put down the cake, picked up the microphone, and said, "Everyone, I'm going to sing Circles to wish Camille a happy birthday!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Neil began to sing the song. Although there was no instrumental accompaniment, singing in a cappella sounded different. In particular, Neil's voice was clear, so it was unique when he sang it like this.</p></div>
