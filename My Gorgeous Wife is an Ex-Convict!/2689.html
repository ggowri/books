        <h1>Chapter 2687</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why did Brian approach Valda Theller? If he wanted to fool around, many women in the entertainment industry were willing to fawn over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, according to the information he saw, Brian was not a man who enjoyed fooling around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland's eyes widened after Brian appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh, is this... the crown prince of the entertainment industry? Many people did not even have the chance to see him, yet he had shown up in front of her. He was even so close!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland would have screamed if she were not in a hospital ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller, who was sitting on the hospital bed, saw Brian walking toward her. His figure gradually enlarged in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry I sent them late." Brian looked at the bruises on her face, and gloom swept across his eyes as he remembered Estelle Rowe's report.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller shook her head slightly. 'So, he's the one who saved me. He sent Assistant Maggie to the set!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes glimmered, and he took Raymond Bowman's hands off Valda Theller's shoulders. "Mr. Bowman, Valda is my girlfriend. I want you to watch your behavior in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What on earth do you want from Valda?" Raymond Bowman asked. He knew the man before him was not someone he could offend easily, but he asked anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced at him coldly. "I don't need to tell you. Whatever goes on between Valda and me is none of your concern."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you don't love her!" Raymond Bowman panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it? What if I say I do love her?" Brian asked slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman looked at Brian with shock. "What did you say? You love Valda?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's expression remained unchanged, and his voice rang in the ward. "I love Valda Theller. We&rsquo;ll never break up unless she wants to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The ward was silent. Raymond Bowman could hardly believe what he heard. 'What did Brian say? Did he give Valda the right to break up with him? A man will only say things like that when he&rsquo;s madly in love with a woman.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian looked calm when he said that. His deep phoenix eyes were infinitely dark. No one could figure out what was on his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Raymond Bowman, I know what kind of person my boyfriend is. You don't need to worry. My boyfriend and I are getting along just fine. I know better than anyone how serious he is to me, so please leave, okay?" Valda Theller's voice broke the silence in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but he said nothing in the end. He walked dejectedly out of the ward and leaned against the corridor wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What am I doing? I desperately wanted to make it up to Valda by approaching her and protecting her, but I did nothing when she needed protection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'And now I'm desperately jumping up and down like a clown, saying Brian has another motive for getting together with Valda.'</p></div>
