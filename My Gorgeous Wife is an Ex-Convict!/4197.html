        <h1>Chapter 4195 The One I Love Most is You</h1>
        <div><p> Tina bought some things in the mall, and in addition, Kit bought her a lot of nutritional supplements suitable for pregnant women, as if he was afraid she would continue to suffer from malnutrition.</p><p> In the following days, Kit rented a nice detached house in the local area. It had a yard with many flowers and plants, which made people feel much better.</p><p> The house was nicely decorated, and with a little arrangement, it felt very warm.</p><p> &quot;Let&#x27;s live here for now. After you give birth to the baby... &quot; Kit hesitated for a moment, &quot;at that time, we can find another place.&quot;</p><p> &quot;Won&#x27;t we go back to our previous home?&quot; Tina asked, puzzled.</p><p> In her opinion, since she was carrying Kit&#x27;s child and from some of Kit&#x27;s words, it seemed that they were not married.</p><p> But even if they were just boyfriend and girlfriend, it was very likely that they would live together at the stage of pregnancy.</p><p> Kit lowered his gaze. &quot;I sold our previous home because I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll go back to that city anymore. So in the future, we&#x27;ll have to buy a new home.&quot;</p><p> Another lie!</p><p> He just didn&#x27;t want to take her back to Emerald City because once they returned, all these lies would be easily exposed.</p><p> Fortunately, Tina believed his words, but she wondered, &quot;Why won&#x27;t we go back?&quot;</p><p> &quot;Because I have broken ties with my father. I don&#x27;t want to be controlled by him anymore, so I don&#x27;t want to go back to that city,&quot; he explained.</p><p> She paused for a moment and asked, &quot;What about your mother?&quot;</p><p> &quot;She died a long time ago. I grew up in an orphanage, and my father only came to get me when I was 8 years old. He thought he could give me fatherly love.&quot;</p><p> &quot;But it was just another form of exploitation.&quot;</p><p> &quot;If he didn&#x27;t have this decent appearance, my father would never have adopted me.&quot;</p><p> &quot;And after I left the entertainment industry, I lost my usefulness to my father.&quot;</p><p> &quot;He took back the house he had given me and most of the money I had earned over the years. I was left with only a couple hundred thousand.&quot;</p><p> &quot;This money is enough for me to live a normal life. The extravagant lifestyle I used to have is no longer possible.&quot;</p><p> &quot;But I don&#x27;t regret it because I want to live life on my own terms.&quot;</p><p> &quot;Now, I&#x27;m grateful for this decision. It&#x27;s why I left Emerald City and found Tina in a place far away from there!&quot;</p><p> &quot;Tina, you&#x27;re the only one I have left now,&quot; Kit murmured. &quot;Even if it&#x27;s just for a short time, I hope you can feel happiness by my side.&quot;</p><p> &quot;I already feel happy now,&quot; Tina said.</p><p> Kit embraced the person in front of them, using it as a shield to hide their own bitterness. If one day, the Hunter family or the Stephenson family were to find them or if she remembered the past.</p><p> Will she still feel happy then?</p><p> &quot;Remember, you are the person I love the most in this world. No matter what the future holds, it will always be you,&quot; Kit whispered.</p><p> &quot;Me too!&quot; Tina buried her face deeper into Kit&#x27;s chest.</p><p>Once upon a time, a person wandered anxiously in that unfamiliar village every day.</p><p>But now, with Kit by her side, she finally wasn&#x27;t as afraid! She felt that life was becoming more and more stable.</p><p>She lived a peaceful and orderly life, and Tina felt happy every day.</p><p>However, alongside her happiness, deep down in her heart, there was always an unshakable sense of urgency, as if her body was urging her to do something.</p><p>But she didn&#x27;t know what exactly she should do! </p></div>
