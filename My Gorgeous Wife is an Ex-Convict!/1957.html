        <h1>Chapter 1955</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After he was done speaking, Hadwin Stephenson quickly walked out of the private room while carrying Lina in his arms. Emily Flowers was so mad she smashed the teacup in her hand on the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does my son care so much about Lina even now? He even sounded like he's going to have the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is he... planning to marry Lina?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'No, I&rsquo;ll never let such a woman join the Stephenson family! My daughter-in-law should be a socialite from tMason Swansonty, not an ordinary person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If a woman like her joins the Stephenson family, then I can never hold my head high in society!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers's eyes gleamed as if she had made up her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the other hand, Hadwin Stephenson carried Lina into the car and told the driver to go to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What did they do to you? Does it hurt?" Hadwin Stephenson urgently asked but only saw Lina looking at him in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What are you looking at?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You came to save me... Did you rush over... because you learned that your mother wanted to see me and was afraid your mother would harm me?" she stammered because of her swollen cheeks, which stung her when she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson frowned. Watching her speak with difficulty and pain, he said, "Alright, stop talking. Be quiet!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Unspeakable guilt and confusion filled his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was right. He did find out that his mother wanted to see her and rushed over. However, seeing her looking like a terrible mess was out of his expectations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It felt as though his heart was about to burst when he saw her like that. Even his blood was about to freeze at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though she hurt him so badly back then, he was still reluctant to lay a hand on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was his greatest treasure but had received such treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Most importantly, the one who caused this was his own mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At this moment, besides anger, Hadwin Stephenson's heart was also filled with guilt and something he could not describe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina obediently shut her mouth and did not speak again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'He came. He came to save me. There's nothing that can make me happier! Our baby's safe, and he must have come so quickly because he cares about me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once they reached the hospital, the doctor examined Lina. The baby in her belly was all right. Lina only suffered some skin injuries. Besides her swollen cheeks, there was a bit of blood oozing out of the corner of her mouth, but she was generally all right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina had become a frequent visitor to the hospital ever since she was pregnant. She let out a long sigh of relief to know that her child was safe and sound. She did not care about her injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was more nervous than Lina, asking the doctor about how long it would take for her to heal. He also asked for details of her follow-up treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once they got the medicine and left the hospital, Hadwin Stephenson said, "I'm sending you back to your hotel now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No!" Lina said hurriedly. If she returned to the hotel, her parents' hearts would break if they saw her like this. "Why don't... you drop me off in front of some other hotel and I'll book myself a room?"</p></div>
