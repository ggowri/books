        <h1>Chapter 681</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes glistened as he lowered his eyelashes gently. "Maybe he's having a hard time after framing you. He&rsquo;s been abroad, and if he didn't want to come back, we wouldn't have been able to catch him so soon. He voluntarily returned and surrendered himself when he knew that they&rsquo;re investigating the case again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, what he did not say was that Dexter Rios was willing to surrender himself because he had used a lot of means to force the man to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A hard time?" Grace snorted. "Can he be forgiven just because he had a hard time? It's like murdering someone and asking forgiveness from the victim. Don't you find it ridiculous? I just didn't die in prison. If I had died in prison, there's no way I could stand in front of him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every word she said was like a whip, whipping his heart and making it harder for him to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So... You won't forgive him, right?" asked Jason in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I can never forgive a man who has done me so much harm!" replied Grace, unaware of Jason's unusual behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All her emotions were in the anguish of having been framed. "How dare he ask for forgiveness? How dare he? If kneeling and apologizing is the solution, why bother with the law? I won't forgive him. Absolutely not. He ruined my life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop!" Jason suddenly threw his arms around Grace. "Grace, stop saying that, all right? If you don't want to see him again, then you'll never see him again. If you want him to get what he deserves, then he will!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Just stop saying that!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she knew the truth, she would not be saying those words to Dexter Rios today, but to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I had any pity for her back then, it wouldn&rsquo;t have come to this!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sobbed in Jason's arms. "Jason, why do you think human nature is so evil? Is it so easy to sacrifice someone else's life for your own? Even if he came back voluntarily and accepted the trial, I can't get back the life he destroyed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unless time could be turned back, otherwise even if he was sentenced to life imprisonment, it was only a great relief to her. The rest was meaningless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason only felt the chest area of his clothes getting wet again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew they were her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was crying, crying for her three miserable years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, all he could do was to help her reverse the case and clear her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not give or tell her the rest!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, it's because the evil of human nature is beyond your imagination," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;ll make it up to you. I&rsquo;ll make up for my cruelty to you and for what you&rsquo;ve suffered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'So please forgive me just this one time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Forgive me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said to himself, because... He loved her so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the same meeting room in the detention center at night, Dexter Rios was looking at Jason puzzledly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, Grace seemed nothing more than a pushover who anyone could bully. Even though she was Sean's girlfriend, she was powerless herself. Besides, he was sure the Stevens family would not offend the Atkinson family and the Reed family for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he had used Grace as a scapegoat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he never expected Jason to stand up for Grace one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two people who could never have interacted with each other outside of Jennifer Atkinson's case did so.</p></div>
