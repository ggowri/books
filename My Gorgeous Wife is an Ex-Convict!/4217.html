        <h1>Chapter 4215</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the middle of the night, Tina on the hospital bed suddenly groaned, and Chandler immediately woke up, quickly leaning over to the bedside, looking at Tina, and asking, "Tina, what's wrong with you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if hearing his voice, Tina who was lying on the bed slowly opened her eyes and looked at Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're awake? Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere? I'll immediately call the doctor to come and check on you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of Tina's condition, her attending physician has been staying at the hospital these days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler pressed the call button and the doctor quickly arrived at the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the examination, it was determined that Tina had no problem, and the medical staff left the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the ward, Tina looked at Chandler and said, "I want to drink water."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Chandler poured a glass of water and let Tina drink it with a straw.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After drinking the water, Tina's spirits improved a bit. "Where is Kit? I want to see Kit. Where is he?" Tina asked. She hadn't seen Kit since she woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What puzzled her was that when she asked this question, the man in front of her looked at her with a sad expression, as if he was feeling very upset!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why would he show such an expression? And looking at his sad expression, she also had some indescribable feelings in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened to Kit?" Tina asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's expression became even more desolate. Although he knew that she cared so much about Kit now just because she lost her memory, because of Kit's lies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he really saw her eyes filled with concern for Kit, it felt like his heart was being bitten by a venomous snake, painful and uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And that kind of anger that had nowhere to vent, almost driving him crazy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really want to know how he's doing?" Chandler stared at Tina and asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina paused for a moment, then nodded firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just because she had just woken up and was still very weak, even though she nodded firmly, it was only a slight nod.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's fine now, very safe, but he's not in Emerald City, he's undergoing treatment in a hospital in another city," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Emerald City?" Tina was stunned for a moment, then asked, "Is this Emerald City? But... why was I brought here for treatment? Why isn't he here with me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because your condition and the baby's condition are more serious, better treatment couldn't be obtained there, so you were brought back to Emerald City for better treatment. Besides, this is the city where you were born and raised, is there anything wrong with bringing you back here?" Chandler explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why did you bring me and the baby back, but didn't bring Kit with us?" Tina asked, puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because..." Chandler paused for a moment, his voice becoming low, "Because you are an important person to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was taken aback, important?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What kind of relationship did we have before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's eyes flashed with a painful expression, then he lowered his eyelids, concealing the pain in his eyes. "I'll tell you when you get better in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I'm important to you, our relationship must be extraordinary, right? Can you help me transfer Kit to Emerald City? He is my husband and also the father of my child! He is really important to me!" Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Kit never said they were married, during the time they were together, she already considered him as her husband.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They felt like an ordinary couple, eagerly anticipating the birth of their child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her words seemed to provoke Chandler, who suddenly shouted, "He's not your husband, and the child is not his! Your husband and the child's father are..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In response, she looked at him with a terrified expression.</span></p></div>
