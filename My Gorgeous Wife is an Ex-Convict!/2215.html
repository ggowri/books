        <h1>Chapter 2213</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she took the medical kit over, she saw Martin Weiss picking up the glass shards that had fallen to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you picking them up for? Stop picking them up!" she said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry I made such a mess... I'll clean it up," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I'll do it later!" Kyla took away the glass shards he picked up and looked at his hands. Fortunately, the glass shards did not puncture his skin, so it was relatively simple to tend the wounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly took cotton and gauze to stop the bleeding first. "Let me know if it hurts," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not say a word while she was stopping the bleeding for him. It was as if he felt no pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she briefly treated the wounds on his hands, she looked up only to look straight into his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla turned away, but Martin Weiss said, "If I hadn't forced you to abort the baby, would things have been better between us? Would we... have gone back to the way things were? Perhaps... you would&rsquo;ve fallen in love with me again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The question had been circling in his mind for days. He had only mustered the courage to ask now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stiffened slightly, and her red lips were pressed together. "Is it necessary to ask this now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I say that it is?" Even if he died, he wanted to die knowing the answer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes gazed intently at her with intense sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only felt her throat become unusually dry. Then, she heard her own voice say, "I thought I could take my time to believe in you and some of the things you said again. But the moment you had them press me against the operating table, what little trust I had built up for you shattered."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A low roar of pain instantly came from his throat!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Trust... I once told her I hoped she would one day trust me again and believe that I truly loved her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But it turns out that I ruined that little hard-earned trust again.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's my fault... It's all my fault..." murmured Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a slight knock rang out and Kyla opened the door. Martin Weiss's driver had arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said to the driver, "His hands are wounded. I&rsquo;ve bandaged them, but you'd better take him to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes, I'll take Mr. Weiss to the hospital right away," the driver answered quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss got up and heard Kyla say, "Don't come over like this again, Martin Weiss. All I want is a peaceful life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stopped in his tracks. After a long pause, he finally murmured, "Okay..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Martin Weiss left, Kyla looked at the shattered glass shards and blood on the ground. Then, she quickly took a broom to clean the glass shards before mopping the area. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, they were not loud, so they did not wake her mother and Nelson up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla realized her hands were also stained with blood after cleaning everything. She did not realize it earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This is... Martin Weiss's blood!'</p></div>
