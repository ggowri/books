        <h1>Chapter 3447</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William was looking for a topic to break the silence when Mason spoke up first, "How much do you like Jasper?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Cough cough..." William almost choked on his saliva. He never expected the other person to suddenly ask such a question. "Um..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How much do you like it?" Mason continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment of contemplation, William said seriously, "I really like it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if she has feelings for someone else?" The Reed family knew that Jasper had always remembered the boy who was once called Lawrence, throughout these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Lawrence is currently missing, every year on the day the Abbott family had their accident, Jasper goes to the house they used to rent and visits Lawrence's parents' graves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For Jasper, this has become like a ritual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other hand, it can also be said that Lawrence holds a very important place in Jasper's heart, and Jasper has never let go of Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William said without hesitation, "Even if there is someone else in her heart, I still like her very much. My liking for her will not decrease by even a single point because of someone else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, you want to be with her forever, right?" Mason asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if she only sees you as a friend forever?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When this sentence was asked, William remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From a young age, he knew exactly what he wanted and has been working hard towards it. As for Jasper, he knows that she considers him an important person and she often expresses her fondness for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this liking has nothing to do with romantic feelings between a man and a woman, it's just a fondness that has been carried on since childhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone in the Reed family understands his feelings for Jasper, even Mason who is usually quiet and seems indifferent to everything has noticed it. However, Jasper himself is the only one who is still unaware of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So I will make her see me as more than just a friend," William replied to Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they grow up, and Jasper eventually understands romantic feelings between men and women, he will try his best to make Jasper fall in love with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He will make himself better, make Jasper more accustomed to his presence, and make her unable to live without him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Jasper approached and looked at Mason, asking, "Mason, what were you and William talking about just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not much," said Mason, returning the phone to Jasper. "You guys can keep talking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, he stood up and walked towards his own bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's plan, isn't it just like him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't want Veronica to see him only as a younger brother, but... was he too late? Because Veronica was about to officially accept Daniel's proposal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he walked into the bedroom, he unexpectedly saw his father in his room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wanna chat?" Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you want to talk about?" Mason asked calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's talk about you and Veronica. Did you come back to live here suddenly because of her?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason pursed his lips and remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason continued, "Veronica has found someone she likes, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason was suddenly stunned, he never expected his father to know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason continued, "The boy she likes is named Daniel, right?"</p></div>
