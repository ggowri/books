        <h1>Chapter 4034</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's caesarean section went smoothly. The doctor only took five minutes to quickly remove the fetus, followed by rapid suturing and then the next surgery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The eight-month-old baby was quickly subjected to various emergency treatments according to the previous plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The child was successfully placed in an incubator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Nancy didn't know any of this. She was completely under anesthesia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How long has it been?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is she still alive?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What about the baby? Is the baby okay?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everything about her body seemed so exhausted, exhausted enough to make her want to give up everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But there was always a voice calling out to her in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, Nancy..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was...Mick calling her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't just fall asleep like this. She wanted to open her eyes, to see Mick, to see their child...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy felt like she was using the greatest strength of her life to open her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, light slowly poured into her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was so bright that it was almost blinding!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her vision was almost completely white, and it took a while for her to slowly see everything in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was... a white ceiling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were also unfamiliar machines and medical staff in white coats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's awake, finally awake, that's great!" She heard someone shouting happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to speak, to ask something, but her mouth was very dry and her body was so weak that she couldn't even speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was only after a while that Nancy learned that she was now in the ICU ward, and it had been seventeen days since she gave birth and had surgery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her awakening finally relieved everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seventeen days?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had been unconscious for so long!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And what she was most worried about at the moment was, "Mick... Mick... how is he?" She used all her strength to say these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the sound came out of her mouth, it was very light and indistinct.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the nurse understood and replied, "Mr. Mick is very worried about your condition. You waking up is really the best news for him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... want... to see him..." She wanted to see that man, no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had been in a coma for 17 days. What had he been doing during those 17 days?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying a few words, Nancy became tired and fell asleep again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she woke up again, Mick was standing by her bed wearing sterile clothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked haggard and had lost a lot of weight, but his peach blossom eyes were shining with hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she finally felt like she had survived!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And this man had survived too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm... sorry... for worrying you..." Nancy said weakly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't apologize to me anymore!" Mick said softly. "I should be the one apologizing. You finally woke up, it's really... really great."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice became more nasal, as if he was about to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't... cry." Nancy said, because every time she saw his tears, she felt sad and heartbroken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not crying." Mick knelt down and gently held Nancy's still damp hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, he wasn't crying. His beautiful black eyes weren't shedding tears, but why did she feel like he was crying?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How's the child?" She continued to ask with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The baby is doing well, although still in an incubator. However, all indicators are good and the weight is increasing smoothly. In just over a month, as long as the weight meets the standard, the baby can leave the incubator smoothly."</p></div>
