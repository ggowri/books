        <h1>Chapter 3427</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason ordered the driver in front in a cold tone, "Drive us back to the Barlow family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The driver acknowledged and started the car again, heading towards the direction of the Barlow family. Mason kept his gaze fixed on the window until he could no longer see Veronica's figure, then he lowered his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While driving past the entrance of the shopping mall, he caught a glimpse of her and instructed the driver to stop the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as he was about to open the car door and get out, he saw the electric scooter rushing towards her. In the next moment, she was firmly held by Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt regretful in his heart, wondering why he wasn't the one who saved her, but at the same time he was also relieved that she wasn't hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But then, he thought she would push away Daniel, but she didn't!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She did not push Daniel away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This made him feel like there was a needle piercing his chest, accompanied by a dense and painful sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What is this pain he's feeling? He's not sure, but a sense of fear is spreading throughout his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He's afraid that she'll care about Daniel, that her eyes will only see Daniel's existence, and that in her heart, she'll eventually only have room for Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No! He doesn't want this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wants her to only care about him! He wants her heart to be filled with only him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car drives towards the Barlow family, and Mason's hands hanging by his side become tighter and tighter...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">***</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica returns to the Barlow family, the house is quiet and the lights are off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, there's no one home? She thinks to herself as she takes off her shoes and puts on slippers, walking towards her room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face is a little flushed, even though she's separated from Daniel, that shy feeling still exists because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Daniel hugged her earlier today, she felt her heart beating unusually fast, just like in a teenage comic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Does this accelerated heartbeat mean... she likes him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Does Veronica like Daniel?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about this, Veronica's face grew even redder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she walked to the door of the room, she pushed it open and was about to reach for the light switch when suddenly a hand pressed down on hers, stopping her movement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was startled and turned her head to see that Mason had somehow appeared beside her. "Mason, you scared me. When did you come back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A little earlier than you," he said in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're going to stay in my room alone, at least turn on a light," she said, trying to reach for the switch again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But his hand pressed hers against the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason?" she asked in confusion, but her other hand was also pressed against the wall by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, her whole body was pressed against the wall, and his hands were pressing down on hers, as if he was imprisoning her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's already slightly red face turned even redder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This posture exudes a kind of ambiguity, like the scenes of the male and female protagonists in a teenage comic book, which suddenly made her feel flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, what are you doing? Let go quickly!" she exclaimed, trying to ease her current anxiety and embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've been waiting for Sister Ah for a while now," he said, but he didn't let go of her hand. Instead, he moved a little closer to her, his face approaching hers. His black and white eyes reflected her somewhat bewildered expression.</p></div>
