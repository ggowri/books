        <h1>Chapter 2216</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla speculated but sat down calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman introduced, "Everyone, this is my friend, Kyla. Kyla, this is my man... Neal Reid. The others are Mr. Wang, Mr. Ma, and Mr. Lambert."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid said to Kyla with a smile, "Jacqueline has been talking about you a lot these two days. She said you two have been friends for years. We can get to know each other through this meal today! I heard you're pregnant, so I ordered a sweet soup suitable for pregnant women. Why don't you try it out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, a serving of sweet soup was right in front of Kyla&rsquo;s seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're welcome." Neal Reid's smile was obsequious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Corbyn's pregnant? Congratulations! Why don't you call the father out to have a meal with us? The more, the merrier. We can make it a celebration for Miss Corbyn's baby!" said Mr. Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's heart sank. 'So... that's what they're after! These people want to get in contact with Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's why there's an extra pair of unused chopsticks!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman also chimed in, "Yeah, Kyla. Why don't you call the father out to have a meal with us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks," said Kyla as she got up. "Jacqueline, I'm not feeling well. I&rsquo;d like to go home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh!" Jacqueline Bowman quickly grabbed Kyla. "You're leaving without eating first? Maybe you don't feel well because you're hungry. Why don't you eat the dessert first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I really want to go home," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert's face immediately sank, and he sneered, "Are you really not feeling well? If you are, then we'll send you to the hospital immediately. If you're not, then you're just not showing us any respect. You think we&rsquo;re not good enough to dine with you! Jacqueline, this friend of yours doesn't seem to know how to play the game!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert was the richest businessman among them, so he was used to having his way with things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid had been trying to curry favor with Mr. Lambert recently, so when Jacqueline Bowman said Kyla was carrying Martin Weiss's baby, Neal Reid told Mr. Lambert that his lover knew Martin Weiss's lover. Mr. Lambert was a little interested, so he joined them for hot pot today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla was not showing them any respect today. Mr. Lambert was displeased, thinking even Martin Weiss's lover thought she was better than him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're just a woman Martin Weiss is keeping as a lover. Do you really think being pregnant is a big deal? Do you know what the Weiss family is? You're just an ex-convict. Even if you're pregnant with Martin Weiss's child, you&rsquo;ll never be able to join the Weiss family! Don&rsquo;t you know that Martin Weiss might look up to you if you help the Weiss family seal a few business deals? We're giving you a chance to raise your status here! Don't be ungrateful!" Mr. Lambert snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said indifferently, "I don't think I need your help, Mr. Lambert. And I don't need to raise my status. What does it matter whether I've been in prison and whose baby I'm carrying?"</p></div>
