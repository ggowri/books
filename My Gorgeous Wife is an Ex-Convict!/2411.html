        <h1>Chapter 2409</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But at least he has learned to trust me and my feelings for him! That's progress, right?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled at the thought of it. "Maybe I have sympathy for Brian, but I won't feel reluctant to part with him. I only hope Brian can find someone to share his life with, and..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused and stood on her tiptoes to seal a kiss on his lips. "Jay, I'm not leaving you again. I'm tied to you for the rest of my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She told him again, even though she had said it to him many times before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes glimmered, and she pushed him onto the couch nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His tall body fell onto the couch while she pressed herself on top of him. She smiled as she stared at him. "What's the matter? Don't you believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... believe you," he said hoarsely with a twitch in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ever since he knew that she was willing to give her life to save him, he knew that this woman was the person who loved him the most, just like she said!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could he not believe her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good boy." She lifted her hand and touched his face again. 'His skin is perfect. It's smooth and delicate like it has always been.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason blushed. Her statement reminded him of how she praised their children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the flush on his face, she was startled. Then, she narrowed her eyes even more. "Wow, how cute!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." He was instantly speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, your ears are red! Jay, what should I do? You're so cute!" She could not help taking his face in her hands and kissing him hard as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was conflicted. Although he enjoyed her kisses very much, why did her present state remind him of how she kissed the children?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like how she would call Jasper and Mick cute before picking them up and kissing them. Of course, she also kissed Mason while holding him like this, but Mason always looked expressionless after being kissed&mdash;unlike Jasper and Mick. One would kiss her back while the other blushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do I look like a kid to you?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze before immediately realizing why he said so. Then, she instantly said, "No way!" She said as she kissed him on the lips, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t kiss a kid like this, and... you&rsquo;ve never been a kid to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But didn't you think of me as a little brother?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words brought back memories from long ago. Grace could not help feeling nostalgic as she thought of the past. "Yeah, I thought of you as a little brother at the time. Because I had you by my side, I had the urge to live a good life. It was a pretty good time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, she had been overwhelmed with tears and pain while constantly in tears. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if she had not taken him home, treated him like a little brother, and treated him sincerely, perhaps none of this would have happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Speaking of which, you haven't called me &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; for a long time. I want to hear you call me that again," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really want to hear it?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." She nodded. "Come on, be good, Jay. Call me that." She was like a strange woman trying to trick innocent children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was instantly between laughter and tears, but his thin lips gently spat out the word he had not called out for a long time, "Sis."</p></div>
