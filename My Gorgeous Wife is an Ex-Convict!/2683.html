        <h1>Chapter 2681</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller thought in a trance, feeling as though her consciousness was slightly all over the place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a daze, she thought she heard someone shouting, "Hey, who... Who are you? We're filming now. Please leave... What are you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the forces beating her and yanking her clothes seemed to disappear. All that was left was wailing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, someone picked her up, and she heard a gentle voice. "Miss Theller, I'm sorry that you got hurt. I'll send you to the hospital right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller finally opened her eyes reluctantly. She was greeted by an unfamiliar woman's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was in her 30s. She looked smart and capable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who... are you?" Valda Theller asked with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm&mdash;" Before the woman had time to answer, Queenie Mack had rushed over with her assistant and said, "Who are you? Do you know we're filming right now? Where are the security guards? Get them out of here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her plan was about to come to fruition, but it was ruined by these people who appeared suddenly. How could she not be mad?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she wanted was to run up and slap the woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, even after Queenie Mack shouted for a while, no security guards came. The burly men in black that the woman brought over surrounded Queenie Mack and the extras who beat up Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman said to her men, "Call the police. Tell them that there has been a case of assault!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," one of the men immediately took out his phone and called the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the extras, who were punched to the floor, heard they were calling the police, they immediately struggled and said, "We were acting... How is that assault?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell that to the police!" the woman said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack said bitterly, "Who are you? Since when do you get to control what goes on in our set?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm Estelle Rowe, an executive assistant of Hart Group. Don't I have the right to control what goes on around here?" Estelle Rowe sneered as she looked at Queenie Mack.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The whole crew was stunned as soon as she said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The country's film and television industry could be said to be ruled by Hart Group, which occupied most of the businesses in the industry. Therefore, its president was called the crown prince of the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even the male lead, Gloria, was an artist of Hart Group's talent agency. If a TV show wanted to get on satellite TV, they could not avoid Hart Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the very least, even the film studio everyone was in belonged to the Hart family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To put it bluntly, this was the Hart family's territory!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The president is concerned about this film. He asked me to check it out when he heard that some actors had gone on strike. I didn't expect to see such a thing. What's the matter? Is the film crew trying to kill someone in this film studio?" Estelle Rowe said sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director hurried forward. "We didn't expect the extras to truly beat her up. We asked them to fake it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Estelle Rowe chuckled. "If you couldn&rsquo;t even notice it, that just means you&rsquo;re not a good director."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director's face turned red instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Estelle Rowe's next remark made the director feel like he was hit in the head. "Also, the actors who went on strike today can forget about ever stepping into this film studio again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone gasped as soon as she said that.</p></div>
