        <h1>Chapter 1259</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did I have to give you special notice when I got married?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz was stunned before immediately thinking of Brian. Brian had come to the office to look for Grace. 'Is it possible that Grace married Brian and... is pregnant with Brian's child?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the thought was immediately rejected when it flashed through her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's the entertainment industry's crown prince. How could there be no news about him getting married? It would've been the entertainment industry's hottest news by now!' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz felt more reassured as she thought of this. "Are you just saying that you're married because you're afraid of being criticized for getting pregnant before marriage? Why don't you tell us your husband's name and ask your husband to pick you up after work? Let us have a look at him. It can&rsquo;t be that your husband can&rsquo;t even be bothered to pick you up and wants you to take the bus when you're pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately became silent. Jason would probably come if she mentioned it to him. However, she could forget about working peacefully in the firm after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's silence reassured Andrea Schwartz that she had made the correct speculation. Andrea Schwartz immediately became more arrogant. "Grace, just admit you got pregnant before marriage. Why would you lie? Don't you think it's funny to tell such a lame lie as a lawyer..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, several men in sharp suits were led over by the receptionist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing Grace, the men quickly walked up to her and bowed respectfully. "Hello, Young Madam."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The mention of &lsquo;Young Madam&rsquo; immediately left the rest of Andrea Schwartz's words stuck in her throat. She stared blankly at the men in suits. 'Did these men... call Grace Young Madam?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the men in surprise, one of whom she had met before. He was Old Master Reed's secretary, whom she had met in Old Master Reed's ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We were sent by the old master. He heard that you and Master Reed have gotten married and wants to see you." The secretary was their leader, and he was the one speaking to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips tightly. She never had a pleasant experience meeting Old Master Reed. She was almost disfigured by the old master last time. Now, she was no longer alone. She also had to protect the three babies in her belly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if seeing her hesitation, he added, "Old Master said he'd like to see you no matter what today. After all, your marriage to Master Reed is a joyous occasion for the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though it sounded like an old man's well wishes to others, it sounded more like a warning to Grace. A warning that they would forcibly take her away from here if she rebelled!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, she said, "Okay, but I need to pack up my things and ask for a day off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." He agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the opportunity to text Jason while she packed her bags and asked for a day off. As time was tight and no one could find out about it, she simply typed a line of words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace: [Your grandfather got someone to pick me up.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace had packed up everything and left with the men, everyone in the general office finally came back to their senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did they call Grace &lsquo;Young Madam&rsquo;? Is Grace really married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It must be a rich family. Otherwise, why would they call her &lsquo;Young Madam&rsquo;?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They mentioned some Master Reed. Do you know any rich guy in Emerald City with the last name Yi?"</p></div>
