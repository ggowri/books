        <h1>Chapter 2027</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was relieved when she saw her confident smile. "I was afraid what they said would hurt you. But then again, have you and Hadwin Stephenson talked about getting married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Not really, but..." Lina smiled. "I know I'm the only one Hadwin loves. He has never loved others, so I don't care when we're getting married. I just want us to keep loving each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Besides, I'm pregnant. I don't think I'm in the right shape to get married now. Do you want me to hold the wedding ceremony with a big belly? I want to wear a beautiful wedding dress!" quipped Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Grace said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At noon, the four of them found a nearby restaurant and had lunch together in a private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked through the photos she took with the leading actors on her phone and asked Grace, "Why don't I give you a set when I print them out?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sure," Grace blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sure?" Jason raised his eyebrows and looked at his wife. "What's the matter? Are you going to keep them in a photo album?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's considered memorabilia too. Didn't you help me get autographs and take photos with celebrities before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I remember that celebrity is good at acting and has starred in many good dramas. What about these two men? What have they starred in? Do you like their acting or... their looks?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's handsome face inched closer to Grace as he spoke. His eyes were charming, and his breath smelled nice. Grace instantly felt her heart beat faster, and she seemed to be trapped in his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'He... He's not jealous, is he?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Although they're rookies, they're good at acting. They only look okay though..." she said. Even though the two leading actors were handsome, she could not admit it at such a time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, the leading actors were indeed pretty good-looking, but they were no match for Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Lina counteracted her efforts. "Just okay? Grace, didn't you say they look pretty good and are your cup of tea? Why did you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina only found the pressure in the private room heightening. She instantly shut up as if she just realized it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Gosh. There's a saying that you get dumb when you&rsquo;re pregnant. I've gotten stupid from my pregnancy. Jason's already jealous, yet I'm adding fuel to the fire by saying all these.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All she could do was look at her best friend apologetically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it was too late. Jason's dark eyes narrowed as he stared at Grace. "They look pretty good and they're your cup of tea? What's the matter? Do you like these two men's appearances?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, no, they're my cup of tea, not Grace's!" Lina said hurriedly. Since she had said the wrong thing, she would fix it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Lina tried hard to hurl mud at herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh? They're your cup of tea?" A faint voice rang beside them, sounding jealous. It made Lina freeze instantly as she just realized Hadwin Stephenson was looking at her with jealousy! </p></div>
