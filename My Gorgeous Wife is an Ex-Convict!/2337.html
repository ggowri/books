        <h1>Chapter 2335</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If something's really going on between you two, Chase Harper's dead meat." The words escaped his thin lips. There was even not a hint of bitterness on his face as he said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she felt her blood freeze. He... He was not joking. He was serious!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had anything romantic going on with Chase Harper, Martin Weiss would probably kill him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing... will happen between him and me," she murmured after a long pause. Then, she wriggled. "Will you let go of me now? This is uncomfortable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her. Moments later, he let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She adjusted her sitting posture. "I... want to go back to my hotel and rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss instructed the driver in front, "Go to the hotel."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove off in the direction of the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was at a loss. Martin Weiss seemed to be constantly gazing at her. It was as though he wanted to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past few days, she had gone to great lengths to see him, yet she did not know what to say now that he was sitting beside her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she understood that he would not change his mind no matter how much she begged him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she was staying in tMason Swansonty because she was unwilling. Perhaps... she wanted to see more of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she went back to Emerald City, there was no telling when she would see him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She might never see him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car stopped at the hotel&rsquo;s entrance, Kyla was about to open the door and get off when Martin Weiss suddenly grabbed her hand. "What's the matter? Are you just going to get down from the car?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I thought you came to L City to ask me for help. I'm now right here in front of you. What's the matter? Are you not going to ask anymore?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked straight at him, her lips quivering slightly. "Will you say yes if I ask again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to say nonchalantly, "That depends on how you ask me. Perhaps if I'm pleased with the way you do it, I&rsquo;ll grant your request to spare Jacqueline Bowman's life so that you can learn the whereabouts of the person you're looking for."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla pressed her lips together. "Will you tell me how I can please you? Should I get down on my knees? Or kowtow to you? I'll do whatever you say!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned, remembering how he had grabbed her head and forced her to kneel and kowtow to Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though his feelings for her had faded, unease was welling up within him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go to your room first," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two got out of the car and came to Kyla's hotel room. After entering the room, Martin Weiss casually took off his coat, put it on the couch, and sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he was only sitting casually, he still gave her a sense of oppression, making her flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How do you want me to ask you?" Kyla asked after taking a deep breath.</p></div>
