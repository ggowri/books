        <h1>Chapter 2989</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda continued walking ahead, planning to buy some things before heading to Brian's company to meet him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, in Brian's office, Whitney Cooper looked at Brian with a sad expression and said, "Mr. Hart, do you really want me to leave Emerald City? If I tell you that I don't want to leave here, can you let me stay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no need for that," Brian said coldly. "You've been living abroad all this time, so there's no reason for you to stay here. The only reason I saved you in the first place was because you bear a slight resemblance to my friend, but I don't like it when people have ulterior motives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I just fell in love with you, that's all. After you warned me, I didn't do anything else, and I didn't even show up in front of Valda. Even so, can't I stay?" Whitney said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." Brian said firmly, "If you go back abroad, Hart Group's overseas branch can offer you a job that can support yourself. But if you insist on staying in Emerald City, then in the future, Hart Group will not hire you for any position."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney's face turned ugly. She didn't have much education or skills, and the only reason she was doing well was because of the job Brian gave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she loses her job and has to find a new one on her own, she may end up with only low-paying and physically demanding jobs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I just want to stay in this city so I can catch a glimpse of you more often. Other than that, I won't do anything else. Can't I do that?" Whitney said pitifully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I can't. I don't want to give Valda any reason to misunderstand," Brian said with a cold expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But his cold demeanor only made her more unwilling inside. "Why... I just fell in love with you. Why do you have to treat me like this for Valda? I was the one who met you first. I even dressed up like the person you used to love just to get you to notice me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke and walked towards him, saying "Brian, look how much I resemble that person. I don't even mind being a stand-in. If you think I'm not enough like her, I can even get plastic surgery. Please, let me stay by your side. I'll do anything as long as I can be with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If all I wanted was a substitute, I could have found one many years ago," Brian said coldly. "I could even easily find a woman to undergo plastic surgery to look like Grace. Or do you think that loving someone means only loving their appearance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney was speechless!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It's like she thought she had the winning hand, but now she realizes those cards were useless all along!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, I know I said the wrong thing. Please don't be angry. I just want to say that I'm willing to do anything for you," Whitney said, and then rushed towards Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, the office door was pushed open and Valda's voice sounded, "Brian..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the next moment, the sound abruptly stopped, and Valda stared in shock at the scene before her. Whitney was clinging onto Brian, and the sight could easily be misinterpreted by others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon seeing this, Whitney felt secretly pleased. If Valda really misunderstood, then it would be a good thing.</p></div>
