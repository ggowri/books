        <h1>Chapter 3226</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The angle of the footage is from above, likely taken from a nearby residential building. This gives a bird's-eye view and the person's face is not captured very clearly. Despite this, it has still generated a lot of comments below.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, these comments were unexpected for Valda, as most of them were positive. Some said she was lucky, others praised the romance, and some even mentioned how Brian protected her perfectly. There were also some who expressed envy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although there are some sour words and criticisms among them, overall, they are not very numerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you watching?" Brian leaned over and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Someone filmed today's video and posted it online," Valda said, then opened the video and showed it to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After he finished watching it, he gave his evaluation, "It was well made."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I had known I was going to be photographed, I would have dressed up a bit more." She felt a bit regretful because she was going to an anime convention, so she was only wearing casual clothes and had a plain face without makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're already so beautiful that you've enchanted me completely. Do you really want to become even more beautiful?" His phoenix-like eyes shimmered with desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She blushed and met his gaze, "Why are you getting better at sweet-talking?" He was different from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not sweet talk, it's the truth," he whispered, lifting his hand to gently cup her face. "I only say these words to you, Valda. I'm truly captivated by you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So obsessed...to the point of being completely infatuated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His lips met hers in the deepest expression of love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After their honeymoon, Valda and Brian returned to Emerald City. They naturally went to see Camille first and gave her the prepared gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille happily took the gift and looked Valda up and down. "I feel like after a honeymoon trip, you look even more beautiful. You must be a newlywed bride who has been nourished by love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda almost spit out the water in her mouth. "You're exaggerating too much, kid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where's the exaggeration? Haven't you seen the comments online? They say that within 10 years, no Cinderella will surpass your achievements! You're envied by countless women now. And someone even posted the video of Brian winning that rare comic book set for you at the anime convention. Have you seen it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have," Valda said. She had found the video that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian is really amazing. There were so many questions that I couldn't answer," Camille said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, Camille," Valda suddenly became serious. "Can you tell me everything you know and have seen about Brian during my one-year disappearance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Camille was taken aback. She had told Valda some things before, and Valda had been very upset. "It's all in the past now. You're already married to Brian. Besides, I already told you what happened to Brian when you disappeared, didn't I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But now, I want to know everything you know," Valda said. "Camille, please tell me everything you know without leaving anything out, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because that was the Brian she didn't know, the Brian who made her heart ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for this kidnapping incident, she might not have thought about how he spent that year at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All she knew at the time was that he was desperately looking for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what about the rest of the time? During that year, besides waiting for her message and searching for her whereabouts, what did he do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to know!</p></div>
