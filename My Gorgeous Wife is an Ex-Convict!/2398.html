        <h1>Chapter 2396</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's expression changed. "George, what are you talking about? I... I don't understand. Did someone gossip to you and slander me? Amber Mitchell's my sister. How could I have someone punch and kick her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory looked up indifferently. "How can you not understand? Of course, you understand. You did this because she's your sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Louise Mitchell's expression changed again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She always had you under her thumb. Even after she got out of prison, she still had you under her thumb. It would be a great joke to say you two have some sisterly affection for each other. You visited her several times a month over the years, and she would be covered in injuries every time you left. Do you still think someone slandered you?" George Gregory said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell widened her eyes and felt as if the man had seen through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought he was indifferent to Amber Mitchell, but it turned out that he had already investigated everything and knew everything very well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, we have no sisterly affection for each other. Do you have any feelings for her? After all, when she trampled on your relationship, she trampled on your dignity and pride as well. Even though you begged her, she still went to Herman Moss! She's&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shut up!" The cold voice interrupted her. "You have no right to bring up what happened between Louise Mitchell and me! Besides, she's only a lunatic now. You needn't have to do that to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you want to get even with her? Don't you want her to pay for hurting you?" Louise Mitchell asked darkly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said darkly, "She has... paid enough. If I wanted revenge, I would have done it myself. I wouldn&rsquo;t need you to do it! Louise Mitchell, listen here. Amber Mitchell wronged me, but she never wronged you. You got everything you own now from her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's expression turned utterly pale, but George Gregory turned and went to his study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell glared at George Gregory's back. 'I'm your wife! Amber Mitchell is just a woman who betrayed you! But you're standing up for Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'After all these years... can that woman still influence you like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But Amber Mitchell is doomed to never be able to change her fate. The position of George Gregory's wife will always be mine! Amber Mitchell can only stay in the hospital until she dies of old age!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was dressed to the nines and attended a lavish party. Philip Barlow had gotten the invitation for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many aristocratic families and businesspeople of Deer City attended the party, including the Moss family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace chose to attend the party in hopes that she could get close to members of the Moss family and inquire about what had happened between Herman Moss and Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">the Moss family member present today was Herman Moss's younger brother&mdash;Daley Moss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mrs. Reed, even though I brought you in, I have to remind you that Daley Moss isn't someone easy to deal with, especially when it comes to his eldest brother's death. He's reluctant to talk about it. You&rsquo;re bound to be disappointed if you&rsquo;re hoping to ask questions about his eldest brother and Amber Mitchell," said Philip Barlow as he stood next to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You never know if you'll be disappointed until you try. You're doomed to be disappointed if you don't try," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why do you care so much about Amber Mitchell? Is it really just to help a friend?" Philip Barlow stared at Grace sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace asked rhetorically, "What else could it be? Isn't helping a friend a good enough reason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her dark almond-shaped eyes were clear, and her beautiful face was so sincere.</p></div>
