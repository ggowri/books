        <h1>Chapter 358</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Indeed, those women who were trying to attract Brian&rsquo;s attention were all looking at the necklace on Evelyn&rsquo;s neck. After they heard what she said, their eyes were shining with jealousy and envy. In the end, they walked away begrudgingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn smiled. She knew she had achieved her goals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn said in a soft voice after everyone left, &ldquo;Brian, will you blame me for wanting such an expensive necklace?&rdquo; She looked like a fragile and weak woman. She was biting her bottom lip to make herself look pitiful and small.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As an actress, she knew how to make herself look more pitiful with her facial expressions. &ldquo;I just want to be more suitable for you. I don&rsquo;t want to embarrass you when I stand next to you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at the woman lazily. Suitable? Did she think she would be more suitable for him by adorning herself with jewelry and branded goods?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If that was the way, then there would be millions of women who were suitable for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Aside from her mouth, there was nothing about her that reminded him of the little girl in his memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already bought these things. Don&rsquo;t blame yourself,&rdquo; Brian said flatly. &ldquo;As for whether you&rsquo;re embarrassing me or not&hellip; I think you should work more on that.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Eh? Evelyn was stunned. What did he mean by that? Was he saying that she was embarrassing him right now? In an instant, Evelyn&rsquo;s assured heart was starting to worry again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Right, do you know what your sister is working as right now?&rdquo; Brian asked out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn could not react in time. It was only when she saw the impatience in his eyes did she turn around and say, &ldquo;She&hellip; Isn&rsquo;t she working in the Sanitation Service Center?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian chuckled coldly. &ldquo;It seems that you don&rsquo;t care about your sister.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn trembled. She detected the saltiness in his voice. &ldquo;Um&hellip; My sister doesn&rsquo;t like to stay at home. P-plus, she&rsquo;s with Jason now, so I guess her life is not too bad.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn purposely emphasized Jason. She knew Brian did not like to get close to women with partners.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Indeed, Brian squinted his eyes like he was thinking about something. He did not continue this conversation any further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they were about to leave the club, Evelyn followed Brian into the car. Tonight, he had drunk a little bit too much. She did not mind that he drank so much. It would be even better if he was drunk so that she would have a chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn had planned everything in her heart. When the driver drove the car to Brian&rsquo;s private mansion, Evelyn said hurriedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help him inside. Let me take care of him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver looked at Evelyn. After all, she was his girlfriend. She would get anything she wanted. Everyone was saying behind Brian&rsquo;s back that he was extremely fond of her right now. A driver like him could not afford to offend a woman like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, the driver did not object. Evelyn helped Brian into the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Brian was drunk, he was not completely drunk. Evelyn did not waste much effort to take him into his bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Brian, I&rsquo;ll change your clothes for you. If not, you&rsquo;ll feel uncomfortable after you fall asleep,&rdquo; Evelyn said pretentiously. Then, she started removing Brian&rsquo;s clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Brian&rsquo;s arm was on his eyes. It was as if he was drifting in and out of consciousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When his shirt was off, Evelyn&rsquo;s heart started beating faster. She wanted to go to the next step with him. However, it seemed that he was not interested. The two of them had never even kissed before. This made her extremely uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If something happened between them and she was lucky enough to get pregnant, she would then have to marry into the Hart family for the sake of her child.</p></div>
