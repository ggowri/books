        <h1>Chapter 3935</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes...dating, but not the formal kind. It's just the two of us spending more time together privately. If Mr. Reed can spare some time to be with me, then maybe after spending some time together, you'll know whether you like me or not," Nancy explained quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason pondered, seemingly thinking about what she had just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, if after a while, Mr. Reed, you find that you don't like me, then I will leave obediently. I won't bother you, and I won't say a word about our time together," Nancy continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, do you like me?" Mick suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I do," Nancy answered without hesitation. "There are probably very few women who wouldn't like a man like you. Besides, you've helped me several times. Maybe at first I was grateful, but gradually I realized that I like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, the cold sweat in her palms seemed to increase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't know how much of what she said Mick would believe, but her feelings were genuine. Mick had helped her several times, and she had discovered that he was different from the impression she had of the Reed family's eldest son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if you like me, then even if I find out that I don't like you after spending some time together, shouldn't you be trying to hold on to me and even resorting to any means necessary? Will you really leave so decisively without any further entanglement?" Mick asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her peach blossom eyes had a hint of charm, but at this moment they were sharp as if she could see through people's hearts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's because I know myself. If you don't like me, then no matter how much I try to hold on, it's useless. I might even end up embarrassing myself, right?" Nancy replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick stared at her and after a moment, he spoke slowly, "Since we're going to spend some time together, you don't have to call me Mr. Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's eyes lit up with surprise, indicating that he had agreed to her proposal!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can I call you Mick when we're alone?" Nancy asked obediently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," Mick said. "I hope our future interactions won't disappoint me." He also wanted to know what kind of feelings he had for the woman in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's heart beat wildly as she waited for Mick to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who would have thought that Mick would actually agree to her ridiculous proposal?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Being with Mick... even though it wasn't a real relationship, it was the only chance she had now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at her mother's photo, Nancy said, "Mom, if you're in heaven, please bless me so that I can use Mick to get justice for you from the Schultz family. As long as I can get this justice, I will do whatever it takes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if it meant using someone who had helped her, even if it made her feel guilty... besides, she had no other way to help her mother get justice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mother shouldn't have died!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And it was even worse that the killer who caused her mother's death was still at large!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would make Clarissa pay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for what price she had to pay for Mick to achieve her goal, she didn't care!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, she had nothing left to lose!</p></div>
