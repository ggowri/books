        <h1>Chapter 2034</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she did not have to pack anything to spend the night at Hadwin Stephenson's mansion. She had her clothes and daily necessities there. After returning to Emerald City, she alternated between staying at his mansion and her home!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson drove while Lina sat on the passenger seat, looking at the man beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His chiseled face and delicate features made him look more defined from the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His collarbones were exposed beneath his graceful neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Am I... really going to marry him? After all these years of loving and hurting, am I finally marrying him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'We'll form a family together, raise our children together, and grow old together. Our hair will turn gray, and we&rsquo;ll have many children and grandchildren.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She gently stroked her bulging belly at the thought. 'It won't be long before our baby is born. Whose looks will they take after?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Will they look like him or me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If they take after his looks, they&rsquo;ll be beautiful whether they're a boy or a girl!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could not help chuckling at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? What are you laughing at?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just thought of how funny dads with their kids are when I scrolled through those short videos earlier. I wonder how you'll be like with our child," she said,</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You'll find out when the baby is born," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I wonder if we'll have any conflicts or quarrels after our child's birth. I've seen online posts where many couples were fine at first, but they started having conflicts after their children were born," she said a little apprehensively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Stop looking at those posts. They&rsquo;ll only upset you. Even if we quarrel and have conflicts, I&rsquo;ll always be the first one to surrender," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was slightly stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car happened to come to a crossroad where there was a red light ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stopped the car and turned to look at Lina. "I can't guarantee that we'll never quarrel, but you have to believe that you're the only one I&rsquo;ll love. We're going to be husband and wife tomorrow. I'm never letting go of you as long as I live."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina only heard her heart beating wildly as she stammered slightly, "I... I'm never letting you go either. My parents even said they're worried I would bully you after we get married. How could I possibly bully you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Gosh, what am I talking about?' Lina's face instantly turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson smiled slightly. "You're the only one who can bully me. Your parents had the foresight to tell you not to bully me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the red light turned green, Hadwin Stephenson continued driving the car while Lina felt her heart beating strongly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It beat so fast!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was shy and delighted. She and Hadwin would be happy together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina slept well in Hadwin Stephenson's mansion that night. She slept through the night and woke up in a daze in the morning. Hadwin Stephenson helped her wash her face and brush her teeth before helping her put on her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They needed to take registration photos when they registered, so Lina went out of her way last night to get matching outfits for Hadwin Stephenson and herself. They both wore white sweaters with beige pants and white sneakers today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Lina was stunned when Hadwin Stephenson put on the outfit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was usually in a suit and tie. It was indescribably refreshing when he wore an outfit like that. Besides, he had always looked young, so he now looked like a young man fresh out of college. He could even star in an idol drama. </p></div>
