        <h1>Chapter 1281</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was stopped every time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is Chairman Weiss someone you can see anytime you want? Scram! We'll call the police if you do this again!" the security guard said impatiently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a figure suddenly came over and said, "Move aside and let her in. Chairman Weiss wants to see her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was stunned as she looked at the person in front of her. She... She remembered that this person was Martin Weiss's secretary, who was also her former... colleague!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two were still good friends back in the day. They had subtly reminded her several times that there was someone else Martin Weiss cared about, asking her not to get too invested in the relationship. Unfortunately, she had refused to listen. She poured her heart and soul into the relationship and ended up like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All in all, she had been stupid and naive then. She had brought it upon herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The security guards who stopped Kyla Corbyn were dumbfounded. They had no idea that this woman could really see Chairman Ye! Immediately, they began to speculate who Kyla Corbyn was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn followed the secretary into the building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They did not talk to each other until they brought Kyla Corbyn to Martin Weiss's office and said, "Chairman Weiss yields to a soft approach. If you really have something to ask of Chairman Ye, swallow your pride. It may come in handy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, they knocked on the office door and opened it. "Go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn knew it was a friendly reminder. She whispered, "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a pity she had not taken their advice back then. Otherwise, her life might have ended up differently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... if she had pulled away in time, Nelson would not have existed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss had given her the greatest pain, but Nelson was her greatest happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn walked into the office. In the large office, Martin Weiss was sitting at the desk in front. "You wanted to see me?" he asked lightly as he looked up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Earlier, a secretary had told him that Kyla Corbyn was in front of the building, making a fuss to see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After some hesitation, he asked the secretary to bring her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you have someone take Nelson away?" Kyla Corbyn asked hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned. "What happened to Nelson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's missing. Did you take him?" she asked again, her face full of worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would I be asking you what happened to him if I had taken him?" Martin Weiss only found Kyla Corbyn's question silly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about Paisley Daniels? Would she have gotten someone to take Nelson away?" Kyla Corbyn's only concern was where Nelson was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Paisley wouldn&rsquo;t have done such a thing," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you call and check? Do you trust her that much?" Kyla Corbyn was worried, wondering if Paisley Daniels had taken her son.</p></div>
