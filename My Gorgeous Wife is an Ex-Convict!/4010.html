        <h1>Chapter 4008</h1>
        <div>.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mick, you-" Grace's voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Around them, there were gasps of shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Jasper's voice, "Big brother... don't cry, Nancy will be safe, she will..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Crying? Did he cry?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick blinked in confusion, his vision gradually becoming blurry, as if covered in a layer of mist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but the next moment, something seemed to want to burst out of his throat, and a mouthful of blood sprayed out of his mouth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one expected Nancy to choose to jump off the cliff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And no one expected Mick to cry and vomit blood after Nancy fell off the cliff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Afterwards, not only did the police, but also the Reed family mobilized a large number of people to search the nearby waters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Mick followed the search team, searching the sea for Nancy's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But reality always disappoints.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After 10 days of searching, the person they found was Irene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene was rescued by a fisherman after falling into the sea and was hiding in the fisherman's house to recover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the police rushed into the fisherman's house, the fisherman who saved her was completely stunned. He never expected that the soft and weak-looking woman he saved was actually the kidnapper who committed the kidnapping case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, one of the kidnapped persons is Jasper, the daughter of the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Mick found out that the rescued person was Irene, he rushed into the hospital room designated by the police, grabbed Irene and looked at her with anger in his dark eyes. "Why did you get rescued? What about Nancy? Wasn't she with you when you fell into the sea? Where is she?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The usually aloof and cold-hearted eldest son of the Reed family was acting like a madman, constantly pulling at Irene's collar and questioning her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He even pulled her collar so tightly that Irene had difficulty breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police quickly stepped forward to stop him. "Mr. Reed, let go, or the suspect will suffocate!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Mick let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene coughed repeatedly, breathed in the fresh air in big gulps, and suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong, Mr. Reed? Are you in a hurry to find out where Nancy is? That woman betrayed you, you know!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where is she? You fell into the sea with her, why did you survive? Where is she?!" Mick kept asking the same question persistently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was so urgent and fierce, like a crazy beast that could attack fatally at any moment, but also like he would die if he became any crazier!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene looked at Mick like this and suddenly said, "Did you fall in love with Nancy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was suddenly stunned, and his expression twisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In love? Did he fall in love with Nancy?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No one had asked him this question in the past 10 days, and he hadn't thought about it either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All he could think about was finding Nancy, this woman... she couldn't die! She couldn't!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she died like this, what would the rest of his life become?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Mick's expression, Irene let out a sharp laugh. "Haha, so you love Nancy! Mick, you're so pathetic, falling in love with a woman who used you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's body trembled, feeling like something was pressing on his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was almost suffocating him.</p></div>
