        <h1>Chapter 677</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never knew that he could be so flustered just by hearing her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you feeling better?" asked Grace, not caring that his hug was hurting her. All she cared about was what was wrong with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it did seem that his trembling was subsiding. It was not as serious now. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Better..." Jason murmured, still holding her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that she could frighten him so much and that she had more influence over him than he thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, Jason's trembling finally stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he let go of his hands and said to Grace, "I must have hurt you when I hugged you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. It doesn't hurt too much. I have pretty good pain tolerance," she said. After all, after such inhumane torture in prison, ordinary pain was nothing to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes darkened as if he had thought of something. "All right, I'm fine now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, what was the matter with you just now?" she asked. She would feel troubled if she did not know why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was probably..." He hesitated a little before saying, "It was probably just a bad dream. I woke up with a start, and my body couldn&rsquo;t help trembling because of the bad dream."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes widened in surprise. They both had dreams tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was surprised that he was trembling with fear from nightmares.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Was it a terrible dream?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I guess so," he answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You guess?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't remember the dream after I woke up. It's just my body feeling the fear of it," he said. When he heard her crying &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo;, it was a nightmare for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did she dream of Brian? Why did she dream about Brian? Does that mean she has him in her heart?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he deliberately prevented them from recognizing each other and even if Stella Lindsay took her place, there seemed to be a bond between them which however much he tried to cut it off, it would not!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. It's only a little after 2 a.m., go back to sleep," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about you? Aren't you going to sleep?" she asked hastily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can't sleep, so I might as well not sleep at all," he said, getting up to get out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she took his hand and under his slightly astonished gaze, pulled him back to the bed. Then, she lay sideways beside him and patted him gently with her hand as if she was coaxing a baby that would not sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't we try and see if you can fall asleep this way?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason immediately did not know whether to laugh or cry. "Are you treating me like a child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think kids fall asleep easily this way. We're just trying it anyway. Maybe it'll make you sleepy? Why don't you close your eyes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He hesitated for a moment, then slowly closed his eyes like she told him to.</p></div>
