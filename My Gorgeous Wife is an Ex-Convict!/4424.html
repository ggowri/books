        <h1>Chapter 4422: Thank You</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where is everyone?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But soon, she noticed that the bathroom light was on.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he in the bathroom?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat by his bed, waiting.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, after waiting for quite a while, Calvert still didn't show up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time... that's a bit too long, isn't it?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley frowned and got up, walking over to the bathroom door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ugh... Ugh..." The sound of retching faintly came from the bathroom.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's face instantly showed a nervous expression, and with a sudden push, he burst through the bathroom door.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The scene she witnessed made her whole body jolt in shock.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was hunched over the toilet, vomiting desperately, his face as pale as paper under the light.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvert, what's going on?" Harley stepped forward and asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There was hardly any vomit in the toilet, showing that he was just dry heaving. His eyes were bloodshot, stark against his pale face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's... nothing much, just a bit of an upset stomach, so I threw up," Calvert said as he wiped the corner of his lips.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll go buy you some stomach medicine," Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert suddenly grabbed his hand, "Don't go, I'm not feeling bad anymore, I'm fine now."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley looked at him skeptically, "Really?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mmm, really, I'm fine now, my stomach doesn't feel uncomfortable anymore. You... go to sleep early." He said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley suddenly cupped her face, "Tell me, are you really okay? Calvert, I want to hear the truth."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thin lips pursed, his eyes, reddened, fixed intently on her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I thought we were really close, so whether you're happy or not, I hope you can share everything with me. We have a long time ahead of us together, and I want to understand your true happiness, joy, sadness, and pain. I don't want you to just wear a mask around me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert stared blankly at the person in front of him, and after a long while, he finally moved his thin lips with difficulty.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He... he's dead, he's dead! I knew it, with his gambling habits, he was bound to get into trouble someday, but... how could he just die like that! Wasn't he supposed to make a lot of money off me? Wasn't he incredibly greedy? Why... why did he die before he could get his hands on the money!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouted hoarsely, tears rolling down from his reddened eyes!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Up until this moment, the emotions he had been suppressing finally burst forth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley gently wiped away his tears, then hugged him. She didn't say anything, just comforted him with that embrace.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That night, Harley held Calvert until he fell asleep.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never lost a loved one, so she couldn't truly understand what he was feeling now.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she hoped he could walk out of this sadness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, when Calvert woke up, the first thing he saw was Harley lying beside him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, it felt as though his heart was filled with something.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Every time he was going through tough times, she was always there by his side, giving him hope and helping him forget his pain.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he not fall in love with a girl like her!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley, thank you!" he murmured, willing to spend his entire life protecting her!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No matter what happens, he is determined to stay by her side and protect her!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over the next few days, Calvert pushed aside all his work and shut himself away at home.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Harley stayed by his side too.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news about Mr. Elledge's death has been reported too!</span></p></div>
