        <h1>Chapter 3057</h1>
        <div><p>&quot;Valda...&quot; he shouted, but his voice was drowned out by the rushing water.</p><p>Then he only saw her figure disappear into the waves, the hand that was holding onto the rope slipping away due to the force of the water...</p><p>The speed of the waves was too fast, and in just a blink of an eye, he could no longer see her!</p><p>The basket carrying the baby had finally reached the shore, and Jason took a step forward, holding his daughter in his arms. He looked at the river with mixed emotions.</p><p>He never expected Valda to choose to let Jasmine live in such a critical moment.</p><p>After all, Valda and the Reed family didn&#x27;t have a deep relationship. Even though her relationship with Grace was good, it was far from being a matter of life and death. But now, Valda sacrificed herself for Jasmine.</p><p>Jason couldn&#x27;t help but remember this kindness.</p><p>His gaze fell upon Brian, who had stopped struggling and seemed to have lost his soul. It was as if he saw himself from years ago.</p><p>At first, when Grace chose to save him by falling off the cliff with the car, he was also in great pain.</p><p>But now... it is Brian who is enduring such pain!</p><p>The water in the reservoir is continuously gushing out, with great force.</p><p>In Brian&#x27;s eyes, everything appeared gray and bleak, as if the entire world had turned into shades of gray.</p><p>My heart suddenly feels empty, and he doesn&#x27;t even know what else he can do!</p><p>Will the woman who used to hold an umbrella for him when he was caught in the rain, embrace him tenderly when he was sad, and keep him company when he was lonely, never be seen by him again?</p><p>Her voice still echoed in his ears, but she had already disappeared into the surging waves.</p><p>She had told him that she would be safe and sound!</p><p>But she was not safe.</p><p>And all of this, it&#x27;s because of him and his connections.</p><p>&quot;Valda... Valda...&quot; He kept murmuring Valda&#x27;s name under his breath.</p><p>And when the water in the reservoir finally came to a stop, the surface became calm once again. At that point, there was no longer any sign of Valda to be seen!</p><p>The police who were suppressing Brian have finally let go at this moment.</p><p>Brian struggled to get up from the ground. His eyes, red from exhaustion, stared blankly at the calm surface of the river. Then, he looked towards the cable that Valda had been holding onto.</p><p>Now, the rope is empty and there is nothing on it.</p><p>Throat feels sweet.</p><p>&quot;Splutter!&quot; A mouthful of blood suddenly spewed out from Brian&#x27;s mouth, and the next moment, his body fell straight to the ground.</p><p>Sometimes, losing someone can be an excruciating pain that feels like a knife twisting in your heart, so intense that it seems unbearable.</p><p>When Grace heard the news of Valda&#x27;s disappearance, she was stunned. She stared at Jason with wide eyes and asked, &quot;So you mean... Valda chose to be swept away by the water to save Jasmine?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Jason replied. &quot;I never thought she would make that choice. If she had let go of Jasmine, she could have been saved.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Valda... she can&#x27;t even swim!&quot; Grace could hardly imagine what happened. Even for someone who is good at swimming, it&#x27;s a life-threatening situation. What about Valda...</p></div>
