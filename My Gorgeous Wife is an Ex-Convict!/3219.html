        <h1>Chapter 3217</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence looked stunned. Could he really learn to play the piano with her? But he had heard from his classmates that learning to play the piano costs a lot of money, and his family simply didn't have that much money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He once told his parents that he wanted to learn how to play the piano, but they immediately said they didn't have the money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... my family doesn't have the money for me to learn piano," he said with some embarrassment, as if he had revealed an unpleasant truth in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At his age, he is already aware of the value of money and understands that poor people are often looked down upon by others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In class, many classmates look down on him just because he comes from a poor family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So if I give you money, can you learn to play the piano?" Jasper asked. For her, money was never a problem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she spoke, the Abbott couple responded, "How can we accept this? We cannot let you, Miss. Reed, pay for us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The expression on the face is not at all what it seems, but rather an uncontrollable joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, if the son can frequently play the piano with Miss. Reed, then their family can also turn their fortunes around in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I want Lawrence to learn piano with me too!" Jasper said, taking Lawrence's hand and eagerly asking, "Would you like to do it with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He couldn't refuse her in the face of such a problem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He really wants to learn piano with her. She likes the way he plays the piano, which makes him happy. However, he feels a strong sense of inferiority because she even has to pay for his piano lessons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For a moment, Lawrence just stared at Jasper, unsure of what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Willingly, why wouldn't Lawrence be willing?" quickly answered the Abbott couple on behalf of their son, "Right, Lawrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence just nodded his head slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's smile on his face became even brighter, he turned to Jason and Grace and said, "Mommy and Daddy, can Lawrence play the piano with me from now on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." Jason smiled and then turned to the Abbott couple. "I'll take care of arranging the child's piano lessons."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, Mr. Reed and Mrs. Reed!" said the Abbott couple hastily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A meeting has finally come to an end. As they were about to part ways, Jasper felt a bit reluctant and said to Lawrence, "In the future, let's attend classes together. You must learn more songs and play them for me! We can even play duets together, it will be so much fun."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mmm, okay." Lawrence's face turned slightly red, but he answered very seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She likes listening to him play music, so he will definitely learn many, many songs and play them for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the way back, Grace asked her daughter, "Do you really want to take piano lessons with Lawrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper nodded his little head heavily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if someone bullies him?" Grace asked again. Her daughter was studying with a renowned pianist, and the students there were either wealthy or from affluent families, with very few children from ordinary households.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, for ordinary families, it is not easy to bear the long-term cost of their children learning to play the piano.</p></div>
