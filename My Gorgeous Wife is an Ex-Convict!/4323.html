        <h1>Chapter 4321 Exhausted</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been through so much, that my body and mind are drained. Every step feels like a heavy burden, and my heart is heavy with exhaustion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I've been fighting for what seems like an eternity, facing countless challenges and obstacles. But I refuse to give up, even though my body is screaming for rest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>I know that I must keep going, for the sake of my loved ones and for my own dreams. But sometimes, I can't help but wonder if it's all worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then I remember the moments of triumph, the small victories that keep me going. And I know that I must push through this fatigue, for there is still so much left to accomplish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So I take a deep breath and continue on, determined to reach my goals and overcome any obstacles in my way. Because I know that in the end, it will all be worth it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly Mr. Quentin stared at Tina, "Even if you were to see him again, it wouldn't change anything. He doesn't want to leave with you. We are letting you go from the Quentin family without any cost. The previous deal between Lornell and you is now void, which is already the Quentin family's kindness towards you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Chandler really doesn't want to leave with me, then I'll stay with him. If he's really disabled, I'll take care of him. He can't get rid of me!" Tina declared.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The elderly Mr. Quentin furrowed his brow and said, "Do you think the Quentin family is a place where we can come and go as we please?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can't you understand me? This time, I found out about Chandler from the Quentin family, thanks to the Hunter family. Obviously, the Hunter family wants to solve the problem more safely, without taking any risks. If the Hunter family finds out that I'm on the Quentin family's side and can't even see Chandler, what do you think they will think? And if Chandler ends up disabled or with other serious problems, both of our families might end up in trouble with the Quentin family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Quentin stared at Tina for a while before saying, "The deal between the Quentin family and the Hunter family won't be threatened just because you said a few words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, that's why I just want to meet Chandler. I hope the Quentin family won't restrict my freedom here, at least let me see Chandler. If in the end, I still can't succeed, then it's just my own incompetence. I won't blame the Quentin family." Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Old Mr. Quentin suddenly said, 'Chandler, you heard it too. Sort out your issues with your spouse before coming to the Quentin family! Although the Quentin family is not afraid of trouble, we also don't want to invite trouble!'"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying that, the old Mr. Quentin turned and left!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina stared in surprise at Chandler, who had emerged from the shadows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he still there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did he hear everything she just said?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler walked up to Tina and asked, "Why do you have to do this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I love you, that's why I have to do this!" Tina said bluntly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Chandler had a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. This Tina was just like the Tina before she lost her memory - honest and straightforward, always expressing her feelings for him with direct words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, as she looked into his eyes, they were so clear that he couldn't help but feel like she had truly fallen in love with him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how is that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still hasn't regained her memories, the memories they shared together. How could she fall in love with him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just pity, that's all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when this pity fades away with time, will she regret it in the future? Will she blame him for taking advantage of her sympathy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You can fall in love with someone in an instant, but you can also fall out of love just as </span><span>quickly, right? But how long do you think this kind of love can last?" Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's been a long time," Tina said. "I don't think I'm someone who falls in love easily, am I? My family and friends have all told me that in all these years, you are the only one I have ever loved. So now that I love you, it will last for a long time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Tina, I'm tired. I don't want to keep giving myself hope, only to end up disappointed again," he said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of pain, even more unbearable than the pain caused by the gu worms, was too much for him to bear!</span></p></div>
