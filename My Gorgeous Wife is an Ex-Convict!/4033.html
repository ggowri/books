        <h1>Chapter 4031</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... he loved her enough to be willing to give up his life for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His love was never lacking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was too intense compared to ordinary people!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He put her in the most important position, but what about her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, Nancy's chest hurt even more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you love me?" Mick looked at Nancy, but his expression remained unchanged, and his beautiful peach blossom eyes were still dim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," she said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why did you suddenly say you love me? When I asked you before, you were silent. Why did you suddenly say you love me now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed that he wasn't happy about her saying she loved him, but rather was wondering about the reason behind it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't answer at the time because I didn't dare to promise you anything. I was afraid that something might happen to me. But when Jasper told me what you said to her when I was unconscious, that if something did happen to me, you wanted her to bury our ashes together, that's when I knew what kind of feelings you have for me!" Nancy explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So now you pity me?" Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Nancy was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pity or moved? Because I plan to die with you, so you generously tell me you love me?" Mick sneered, "Nancy, I want your love, but I'm not so desperate for pity or being moved! And..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He walked step by step to the bedside, looking down at her, "Now, I don't even expect you to really love me anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without expectations, there is no pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps their relationship was a mistake from the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even during the time they were together, she kept saying she liked him, but she never had real feelings for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, she was willing to sacrifice her life to save the child, but she wouldn't listen to his advice and wouldn't think about him at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All he could do was accept her decision and then, when she closed her eyes forever, accompany her into the afterlife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's pupils suddenly shrank, as if she couldn't believe what she had just heard!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He no longer expected... he really no longer expected anything from her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, is she one step behind again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just like before, she had planned to confess to using him, but he found out first, leaving her with no chance to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, it's the same thing again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why is she always like this? One step slow, slow step by step.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If what you have to say to me is just this, then I've heard it. I'm going back now, you rest well." He said, turning around. "Also, whatever decision you make, I'll accept it, so you don't have to worry or say anything against your will."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Against her will?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned. Did he think that her words of love were against her will?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did he still not believe that she truly loved him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Were they going to continue this misunderstanding between them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't want to be one step behind anymore. She didn't want to be slow anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Mick was about to leave, Nancy suddenly grabbed his clothes. "Don't go!"</p></div>
