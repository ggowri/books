        <h1>Chapter 3506</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"See me?" Mason frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes... he, he's insisting on seeing you, Mason. Lionel is Veronica's brother and has been with you for so many years. He was just used by someone and made a mistake. Please go see him," Rosalind pleaded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she wanted to use their old relationship to appeal to Mason's sympathy. After all, if Mason agreed to see Lionel, it would mean that the Reed family was willing to save Lionel and not let him go to jail easily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Mason did not agree, making Rosalind even more anxious. Archer, who was beside her, quickly said to his daughter, "Veronica, please help persuade Mason to go see your brother. Lionel's mental state is not good now, and we don't know what happened to him in detention. He knows he did wrong. After he came back yesterday, he didn't eat anything and just locked himself in his room. Your auntie Rosalind and I find it hard to get close to him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Veronica bit her lip and finally said to Mason, "Why don't you go see Lionel and find out what's going on with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason looked at Veronica and said, "Even if he really has something going on, it's his own fault. He almost killed Veronica. Being able to be released on bail is already lucky for him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well..." Veronica looked hesitant. She couldn't help feeling resentful towards her younger brother, but she also knew he was being manipulated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Veronica turned to her father and stepmother. "I'll go back and check on Lionel first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Archer and Rosalind were reluctant, they knew it was better to have someone check on Lionel than no one at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, let's go," Archer said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But just as Veronica took two steps forward, Mason suddenly grabbed her wrist. "Since you're going, Veronica, I'm going too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was taken aback, "But aren't you...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not comfortable leaving you alone," he said, and with just that one sentence, it was as if he had explained everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason was willing to accompany Veronica to the Barlow family, which was exactly what Archer and Rosalind had hoped for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So the group arrived at the Barlow family, and Rosalind opened the door to Lionel's room. She turned to the figure curled up inside and said, "Lionel, come and see who's here. Your sister and Mason have come to see you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The figure curled up in the corner of the room slowly lifted its head and looked towards the group that had just entered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Veronica was also stunned. Lionel looked completely different from before, with messy hair, lifeless eyes, and deep dark circles underneath. He looked like he was wearing a "weak makeup" that you might see online. His cheeks were even a bit sunken, and he seemed to have lost weight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It had only been a little over a week since he was detained, but he had changed so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Lionel lifted his head, his gaze was fixed on Mason. Suddenly, he went crazy and rushed towards Mason, crawling and scrambling, "Mason, I have something to tell you! I...I've been waiting for you. I have so much to say to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, he turned to the people next to him and said, "Get out, all of you! I only want to talk to Mason!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel's emotions were very agitated and not right at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer and Rosalind hurriedly complied with their son's request and left Mason and Lionel alone in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Veronica was a bit worried, after all, Lionel's emotions were not stable at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing her concern, Mason's eyes flashed with satisfaction. Veronica was worried about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As long as she cared about him, he would be extremely happy and willing to do anything for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, you can go out first. I'll stay in the room," Mason said. "Don't worry, I'll be fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Veronica said, "Then...you should be careful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rosalind seemed a bit dissatisfied and said, "Do you still think Lionel can be hurt by..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, let's go out first." Archer glared at his wife and quickly pulled her out of the room. Veronica followed them out shortly after.</p></div>
