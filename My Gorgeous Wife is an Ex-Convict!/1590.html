        <h1>Chapter 1588</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," answered Jason as he held Grace in his arms. He glanced at Hadwin Stephenson before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's face was filled with endless pain and even extreme despair!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though he was alive, he appeared to be a mere shell at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason felt a pang in his heart and stopped in his tracks. Some broken images flashed through his mind, but they were so fast that he could not even tell what they were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Jay?" Grace turned her head and looked at Jason who had stopped and was in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Nothing." With a flutter of his eyelashes, he picked up his feet again and left the banquet hall with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once in the car, Jason leaned back, took a breath, and closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you tired?" A soft female voice rang out in his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"A little."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then take a nap first. It&rsquo;ll take more than half an hour to get to Reed Residence from here," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason tried to relax, but his heart somehow seemed to beat faster and faster. The desperate look on Hadwin Stephenson's face kept flashing through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if he had been that desperate too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'When was it? When was I ever that desperate?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, another scene seemed to flash through his mind again. This time, he saw it. He saw himself holding an urn and wailing in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His voice sounded so desperate. It was as if he did not want to live but was forced to keep living.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why am I not the one who died? Why? I did you wrong. I should be the one to die!" He kept crying, looking so miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why... Why would I say something like that... Is this... what happened after I mistakenly thought Grace was dead?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Was I so desperate because I thought she was dead?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'My head... hurts so much!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It hurt like it was about to explode. A groan escaped Jason's mouth. Suddenly, he felt as if he had fallen into a dark pit. The suffocating sense of despair filled his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No... No... Why..." A broken groan escaped his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How can I get out of this despair?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, a voice rang in his ears...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, what's come over you? Is there something wrong? Can you hear me? Open your eyes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The voice kept on shouting as if pulling him out of despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, he felt her fingers massaging his forehead, relieving his pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The pain faded little by little. Jason slowly opened his eyes, and he instantly caught sight of that comely and quiet face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her face was now full of anxiety. "Are you having another headache? Should we go to the hospital? Or should I ask Uncle Kwan to contact Dr. Guzman and ask him to go to Reed Residence as soon as possible?"</p></div>
