        <h1>Chapter 741</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The mother and daughter, Camelia Meyer and Lily, were immediately surprised at this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The piece of land in the south of the city was a hot piece of land. The Atkinson family had put in a lot of effort to get it. The real estate boom of the past few years had made this land now worth ten billion dollars!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Were they giving Grace ten billion dollars just like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could they reconcile to that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer was just about to have a fit of anger, but what the mother and daughter did not expect was Harold&rsquo;s face to pale. "Are you sure you won't reconsider it, Young Master Reed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could it be that... Jason refused?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer and Lily showed a surprised look at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Harold put down his phone and looked into the eyes of his second daughter with helplessness and sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The causes that were planted now bore the fruit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that Grace, who anyone could trample on back then, would now have the most powerful backup in Emerald City?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'd better leave the entertainment industry and return to the Atkinson family. Since your sister has died, the Atkinson family is yours to inherit," said Harold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Lily knew that she would inherit everything the Atkinson family had, but she was going to wait after she was 30 years old when she had won all kinds of awards in the entertainment industry. Then, she would quit the entertainment industry, return to the Atkinson family's business, and become the actual owner of the company as well as a legend in the eyes of others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to follow the plan she had set for herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, returning to the family business because she was blacklisted&hellip; How could it be the same?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would only be a joke to others!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did Jason refuse? Doesn't he know that it's worth ten billion dollars?" asked Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could he not know? However..." Harold paused. "He said that since you destroyed Grace's career, now he'll destroy your career for Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, Lily felt every hair on her body stand on end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason is such a lunatic!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace went to the small restaurant again, she did not see Nelson and Mrs. Corbyn, so she asked, "Did Aunty take Nelson to the small park nearby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No..." She began to speak but stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? What happened?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I saw Martin Weiss in a shopping mall with Nelson yesterday. I don't know if he saw Nelson and me, but when he turned his head to look my way, I grabbed Nelson and ran away. I was afraid that he would find me, so I asked my mother to take Nelson to hide somewhere else first. They can come back if everything's all right after a while," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not expect Kyla to meet Martin Weiss, so she thought about it before saying, "How about I ask Jason to help you find a place to hide?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled wryly. "Thank you, Grace! However, no thanks. You can help me once or twice, but you can't help me forever, so I'd better take care of this matter myself."</p></div>
