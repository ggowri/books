        <h1>Chapter 1094</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why would he take the medicine I gave him? Is it because of trust?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If he trusts me, why could he trust the me who gave him medicine but not my feelings? If he had given me a little more trust, maybe we wouldn't have broken up at all.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, this trust seemed ironic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when he was asleep now, his brows were furrowed and a thin layer of sweat had broken out on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As such, Grace fetched a towel from the bathroom and gently wiped the sweat off his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom... Mom..." he cried out in a stammer. His voice was so low it was almost a whisper. She had to be very close to hear what he was saying. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he... dreaming? Is he dreaming of his mother?' Grace thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered hearing him say that his mother had left him and her husband when he was young because she could not bear to live in poverty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All these years, his mother never showed up in front of him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered there was a wound on his chest that had nearly killed him, though the scar had faded a lot now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From the faded scar, she could imagine how dangerous it had been. A child with an injury like that could have easily died!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His mother had pushed him away and caused the injury when he tried to stop his mother from leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, don't... Don't leave me... Don't leave me and... Dad... Don't... Don't..." His brows furrowed more and more, and even his head shook slightly as his broken voice escaped his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Another layer of sweat broke out on his forehead, which she had just wiped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He looks just like a helpless child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or... maybe he dreams about what it was like when he was little. He's probably only a child in his dream.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace helped wipe the sweat off his forehead again, then whispered, "Good boy. Go to sleep. No one will leave you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if her mother had died when she was little, her grandmother cared for her, but his... mother left while his father froze to death in the snow. His only grandfather did not even give him much warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Come to think of it, his childhood was much more unfortunate than hers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a pang of pain in Grace's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt sorry for the child who had to be strong to survive at such a young age, the child who got tricked into taking sleeping pills by a servant who pretended to be friendly in an unfamiliar mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm only feeling sorry for the man I no longer love because he's sick,' Grace told herself in her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't... leave me... I don't want to... be alone..." He sounded so flustered in his sleep, and the expression on his face showed a fragility she had never seen before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't leave you, and you won't be alone," she said gently as she played along. Perhaps she just wanted to soothe his restlessness and felt sorry for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason woke up, he only felt a layer of sweat on his body. His whole body seemed to be weak and drained of energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sat up slowly and looked around the room.</p></div>
