        <h1>Chapter 3231</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Faced with these expensive cars, Lawrence didn't dare to choose any of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper said in a strange and authentic manner, "Don't you like anything?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I..." He became even more flustered, and finally pointed to a small wooden house that appeared to be the cheapest in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But this is a small house, not a small car," Jasper said in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I suddenly like this." Lawrence stammered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is a small house made of wood. It has two doors at the front that can be opened and closed. When you open the doors, you can see the interior of a three-story small house. This is a prop that Jasper uses when playing house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I thought boys didn't like playing house," muttered Jasper. She actually quite liked the little house, but since Lawrence liked it, she was willing to give it to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence's face grew redder as he sheepishly admitted that he chose this one simply because it looked cheaper than the other expensive cars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me give this to you, along with all these things inside. Make sure you have fun with them!" Jasper reminded Lawrence, as he gave him all the wooden furniture and little wooden dolls that came with the small house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And so, Lawrence left the Reed House with his parents, carrying a full little house and its accompanying toys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ms. Jasper has sent you these, she must really like you!" Wilona said to her son. "You must try to please Ms. Jasper from now on! Don't let her dislike you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence remained silent. He didn't like the word "flattery" that his mother used. He genuinely hoped that Ms. Jasper could like him, but not because his parents believed that it could change his fate and make him wealthy in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just because she was the first person who liked his piano so much, she even came to find him for the sound of the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he sees her smile, he feels warm and wants to keep seeing her smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you hear me? If you waste such a great opportunity, I won't spare you!" said Wilona.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, Lawrence is still just a child, don't be so harsh with your words," Doran spoke up for his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just because he's still a child, that's why I'm afraid he'll make mistakes and upset Ms. Jasper! You know, opportunities like this don't come often, and if you miss it, there won't be a second chance!" Wilona said, while once again turning to her son and saying, "Did you hear me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... heard you, and I won't do anything to make Ms. Jasper unhappy," Lawrence whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona looked satisfied, while Lawrence turned his head and glanced at the distant Reed family mansion behind him. He held the wooden house in his arms tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To him, this small house is an incredibly precious thing that he never wants to let go of!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Amber started working in Emerald City, Kyla often comes to visit her and they chat and catch up. They also talk about their personal lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes Kyla can't help but marvel at how the two of them, who once met in prison, never imagined that years later they would be chatting like old friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong, do you have something on your mind?" Amber suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Kyla was chatting with her as usual today, she felt that the other person was a bit distracted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just hesitating, whether or not to do something," murmured Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Martin gave her the paper with the hypnotic release code, she has been hesitant about whether or not to release the hypnosis.</p></div>
