        <h1>Chapter 2919</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, Valda Theller was inexplicably restless, lying in bed but unable to fall asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no news about her on the internet after the wrap party, which made her breathe a sigh of relief. It must have been due to Brian Hart's greeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For her, this was the best outcome as she did not want to attract attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The following days were calm and uneventful. She spent her days either at home or in the studio, focusing on work whether in the studio or apartment. This actually made her feel more relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the quiet of the night, she couldn't help but think of Brian Hart and then... couldn't fall asleep for a long time, just like now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days, Brian Hart had not appeared in front of her, as he had promised that day, not to disturb her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps in the future, as time passed, their relationship would slowly fade away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she was thinking, suddenly, the doorbell rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller walked down to the door, puzzled. Who could it be so late?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she reached the door and looked through the peephole, it was Brian Hart standing at the door, ringing the bell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller opened the door, "It's so late, what do you want..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish her sentence, he had rushed into the room, and with a backhand, closed the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, he had pressed her against the wall by the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, why did you lie to me?" His hoarse voice sounded low in her ear, and his hot breath sprayed on her ear and neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...what did I lie to you about..." She tried to push him away, but his hands suddenly grabbed her wrists and lifted them above her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How come you don't know? Do you want me to remind you?" He asked rhetorically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She frowned, "Brian Hart, let me go first. If you have something to say, you can say it properly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let go?" He suddenly chuckled, but his laughter was full of bitterness and resentment. "I've let go enough already. Now, I don't want to let go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned, looking at him, feeling a sense of inexplicable fear from the dangerous aura emanating from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You...you need to make yourself clear. Even if you really want to accuse me of lying to you, at least let me know the reason!" Valda Theller said, feeling both embarrassed and helpless in this position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, then let me tell you what you lied to me about." He whispered, and his lips lightly kissed her earlobe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller shuddered, her body trembling uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, I asked you if you would fall in love with Raymond Bowman, and you said you wouldn't." His lips traced along the contour of her ear, and his voice sounded low in her ear. "If you wouldn't fall in love with him, then why be so intimate with him? Why? Valda Theller, do you think I'm a fool?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When did I become intimate with him? I didn't." She denied it vehemently, struggling even harder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, being subjected to such intimate actions by him made her feel like her blood was boiling, and her ears were burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? His voice became even softer, but the hostility emanating from him became even stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips had already moved to her face, showering her with kisses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt her cheeks getting hotter and hotter, "I said I didn't, Brian Hart. What do you want? We've already broken up!"</p></div>
