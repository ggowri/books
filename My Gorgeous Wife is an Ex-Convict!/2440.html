        <h1>Chapter 2438</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you take Mick back to the hotel first? I'll stay here," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. "I'd feel better if I stay here. Why don't you ask your men to take Mick back to the hotel to rest first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That works," said Jason. Then, he instructed a bodyguard to take Mick Reed back to the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when the bodyguard was about to take Mick Reed from Grace, the little one subconsciously squirmed into Grace's arms and said with a hazy notion, "I want to be with Mommy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the way he was acting, Grace was afraid that Mick would wake up if he was handed over to the bodyguard. Besides, he would probably refuse to go back to the hotel alone if he woke up. "Forget it. Let&rsquo;s just let him sleep here," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mick was still wrapped in a blanket anyway, so she was not worried that the little one would get a cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I carry him so that it's easier for you?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. "Let me carry him. I haven't held him enough over the years. I only wish I can hold him a little longer." Her eyes looked tenderly at her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her five years of amnesia had wasted her time with Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During those five years, she did not have a chance to hold him, so she cherished every chance she got to hold him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian watched the scene in front of him quietly. He had known that she would be a good mother from the beginning, but he found that she was somewhat different from the woman he remembered after seeing how she got along with her child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The distance between them seemed to grow further and further, but he could not do anything about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe it was because he knew that no matter what he did, Jason held her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like how the sense of family between her, Jason, and their children was so strong that others had trouble stepping into their world. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace's phone rang. Fortunately, she had set it to silent, so it did not wake her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace freed one hand and took out her phone, which showed she was getting a call from Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she answered the call, Kyla anxiously asked, "Grace, did you take Amber Mitchell away from the mansion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Grace froze. "How did you know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory called and asked if we had anything to do with Amber Mitchell's disappearance and said he has already reported it to the police. He also said that if we don't hand Amber Mitchell over, the Mitchell family will sue us if they find her and learns we&rsquo;re involved,&rdquo; Kyla said in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "We do have something to do with it. The doctor is conducting a preliminary mental evaluation on Amber Mitchell. It'll take some time. I'll let you know when I get the results."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are you? I'll go over," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe the Gregory and Mitchell families are already waiting near the hotel. It might help them find us more quickly if you come over. Just stay in the hotel. I&rsquo;ll call you as soon as I have news," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla knew that Grace was right, but she could not just sit around doing nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, Kyla clutched her phone tightly with both hands with profound anxiety on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, all she could do now was wait.</p></div>
