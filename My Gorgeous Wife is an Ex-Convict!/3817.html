        <h1>Chapter 3815</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police and the Reed family's security personnel were all stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who would have thought that Mason would rush in knowing that the explosion couldn't be stopped?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Reed family's security personnel only remembered at this moment that when they chatted with their senior colleagues who had worked at the Reed family for a long time, they had talked about Mason's skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's skills were definitely not something an ordinary person could compare to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, they thought their senior colleagues were joking or flattering.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, it turns out that they were telling the truth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the dodging and the kick he delivered earlier were enough to prove Mason's skills.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The crowd wanted to chase inside, but then there was another explosion. Immediately after, another building collapsed with a loud crash, scattering dust and debris, causing the people's footsteps to pause.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What should they do in this situation? Should they follow and rush in?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The chance of survival is too small once hit by the exploding debris!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How many people in this world dare to do this?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason kept running towards the auditorium. At this moment, he didn't even have time to analyze whether what Daniel said was true or false. All he could think about was whether Veronica was really being held by Daniel in the auditorium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His thoughts had almost become blank, leaving only a kind of instinctive action.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Veronica finally broke the rope that bound her wrists. Her hands were already full of wounds, and many of the wounds were still bleeding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Due to the long period of binding, her body had become sluggish and even numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, she could no longer care about the various discomforts of her body. She had to escape from here as soon as possible.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had already heard two loud explosions just now, and after each explosion, there was the sound of a building collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The interval between the two explosions was not long, at most about 30 seconds, less than a minute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So the next explosion should happen soon. Perhaps the next one to be bombed would be this auditorium!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica stumbled towards the door, but the more she tried to speed up, the more uncoordinated her feet became.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the third explosion sounded loudly. Immediately after, the ground shook violently again, and Veronica leaned to one side and fell heavily to the ground.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was lucky that although the explosion was very close, it did not come from the auditorium where she was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boom!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was the sound of another building collapsing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt like her eardrums were about to burst.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The walls around her were rapidly cracking, and large chunks of cement were falling from the ceiling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica realized that the auditorium was also very dangerous now. Even if there was no explosion, it could collapse at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to hurry and escape!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her legs felt weak and powerless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica lifted her hand and hit her leg hard. Finally, she struggled to get up and stumbled forward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to reach the door, a piece of cement fell from the ceiling and hit Veronica's shoulder, causing her to fall to the ground again due to the inertia of gravity.</span></p></div>
