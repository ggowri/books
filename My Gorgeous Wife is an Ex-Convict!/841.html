        <h1>Chapter 840</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the end of the day, she was only a game to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's my business!" His voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, it's his business. I'm not even in a position to ask.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll leave if I give you the photo?" said Grace after taking a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He shuddered as his eyelashes quivered a little. A long time passed before he spat out the word, "Yes".</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fine, I'll give you the photo." She pushed him away, went to the cupboard, and dug out the photo album. Then, she took out the photo of her as a child in a floral dress from the album.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just wanted him to leave as quickly as possible. The longer he stayed in the small rented house, the more he would disturb her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just wanted to stay away from him so that she could calm down and forget about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace handed the photo to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He reached out his hand to take the photo. He lowered his eyes and looked at the photo somewhat distractedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Grace looked at Jason's profile and could not help thinking about what Lina had said about slapping him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it like what Lina said? He let Lina off the hook because of me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Has Brian been here before?" His cold voice rang suddenly, interrupting her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Grace was stunned. She then found that he had raised his deep peach blossom eyes and was staring at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Has he been here?" He repeated the question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Reed, that's personal. You've got the photo, so can you leave now?" said Grace as she walked to the door of the rental house, trying to open it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could touch the handle, his hand had pressed the door first. He was preventing her from opening it. Then, his scent was all over her while his warm breath sprinkled in her ears. "Will you go to Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body suddenly stiffened as she subconsciously wanted to avoid him. However, as she dodged to one side, his arm was already around her waist. He was pressing her even further into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me go!" Grace struggled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her strength was pointless when facing Jason. His body was tightly pressed against hers. His fingers grabbed her chin, forcing her to look at him. "Are you going back to Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was almost like he had to get an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had an impulse to laugh. An ex-boyfriend who had broken up with her was now asking her if she was going to be with another man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he know that the moment she chose to bury her memories and lie to Brian that she had cut off all connections between her and that man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How dare he ask her this now?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was silent while he stared at her. Then, his thin lips softly opened as he said, "You wouldn't, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why wouldn't I?" She deliberately said the other way around, disliking the feeling of being seen through. "Brian has been looking for me for so many years. It&rsquo;s just that he has simply mistaken Stella to be the one he&rsquo;s looking for. Maybe one day I'll run up to him and tell him everything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face suddenly turned extremely pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she going to be with Brian?' A feeling of jealousy welled up in his heart and quickly spread all over his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why does it feel so uncomfortable? Why can her words still affect my mood so easily as if she still controls my emotions?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Didn't I break up with her? As long as I don't love her, everything else will be fine, won&rsquo;t it?'</p></div>
