        <h1>Chapter 1868</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you worried about her?" he asked instead of replying to her question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She used to take care of me and cared a lot about me. I can't be indifferent," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He raised his hand and brushed it gently over her swollen eyes. "But what's the point even if you know how she's doing now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, if you really want to take revenge on Mrs. Watts, at least get her a doctor. Otherwise, at her age, she&rsquo;ll probably die if the fever gets serious," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason suddenly chuckled. "She&rsquo;ll 'probably' die, but what about my father? He did die! Grace, do you know what real revenge is? She's only having a fever now. I haven't had her mutilated, her tongue cut, or her eyes gouged out. I didn&rsquo;t even break her arms or legs. I&rsquo;ve been nothing but merciful. What else do you want from me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would probably have made the woman more miserable if it had not been for Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace gasped and looked at the man in front of her in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason gently stroked the hair beside her cheek. "Did I scare you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I..." Her throat felt utterly dry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But Grace, this is me&mdash;the real me." He showed her his dark side. "But you never have to be afraid of me. I'll never hurt you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace stared at Jason for a long time before murmuring, "I know you won't hurt me, but Jay, are you sure you can't let me see my mentor and his wife?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said, "It's unnecessary. If they want to spend the rest of their lives in prison, that&rsquo;s their choice, isn&rsquo;t it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Due to Mrs. Watts's guilt and remorse, she probably would not avoid this punishment, and her mentor would probably accompany Mrs. Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, it's late. Let's rest early," Jason said to Grace, and she replied in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day after Jason left, Grace went to a cabinet. She opened the drawer and took out a small box inside, which contained a talisman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The talisman was the one Brian gave her when he came to the hospital to visit her before leaving Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Brian only said that she should open the talisman if she ever came across any trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she did not pay much attention to what he said at that time. She only thought that Jay would help her if she were ever in trouble. She would not even need Brian's help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was recently when she opened the talisman that she found an address and a small flower carved out of amethyst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace bit her lip slightly as she squeezed the paper containing the address and the amethyst flower in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking down at tMason Swansonty's landscape, you would feel as if you were on top of the world and were trampling everything else under your feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Brian looked down at everything outside the French window. He had been high and mighty, overlooking everything since he was a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He thought he could get everything he wanted, but it turned out that he could get many things except what he wanted the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Should I say Jason is lucky, or that I&rsquo;m unlucky?'</p></div>
