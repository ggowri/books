        <h1>Chapter 2914</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her silence made Brian Hart think he was right, and his face suddenly changed. "What, are you planning to be with Raymond Bowman? He publicly humiliated himself today and gave you justice. Are you moved by that and have fallen for him again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He approached her, emitting a dangerous aura.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller instinctively stepped back, but he had already wrapped his arm around her waist, not allowing her to move any further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it difficult to answer this question?" he asked, feeling a mix of anxiety, unease, and other emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't intend to like Raymond Bowman," Valda Theller denied. "Today, he gave me justice, which did change my opinion of him, but that's all. He is still a perpetrator to me, and I am a victim. I don't have Stockholm syndrome and won't fall in love with a perpetrator."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words made the emotions he just felt recede like a tide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart stared at Valda Theller in a daze. When did she become so capable of manipulating his emotions?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, he asked, "You won't love Raymond Bowman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," she replied firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt relieved. Perhaps he was afraid that she would fall in love with Raymond Bowman, after all, he was the man she once loved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I don't plan to love you again either," Valda Theller continued. "Brian Hart, I am physically and mentally exhausted. I just want to work hard and not love or hate anyone. So please don't disturb me anymore, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart sank because of her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So she didn't plan to love Raymond Bowman, but she also didn't plan to love him again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, if you just want to work hard, then I won't disturb you," he said. As long as she didn't love anyone, he would still have a chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Calm her down first, then slowly integrate into her life. As long as there was enough time, he could make her accept him again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Valda Theller was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't lie to you," Brian Hart said. "So don't lie to me either, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip and didn't answer him, only saying, "Can you let go of me now? I'm tired today and want to go back to rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart reluctantly released his arm from her waist, and Valda Theller turned and walked into the community.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart stood there, staring at her back in a daze until her figure disappeared completely from his sight. He then returned to the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, I won't give up like this," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this point, he couldn't give up. If he lost her, he might never be able to love another woman besides Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the only woman in the world he could love. No one else could replace her!</p></div>
