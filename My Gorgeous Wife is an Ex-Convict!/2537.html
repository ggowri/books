        <h1>Chapter 2535</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Herman Moss&hellip; won her over with just a bracelet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He, George Gregory, was probably nothing to her now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory returned to the car and looked down blankly at his palm. His right palm still had marks left by the bracelet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is wrong with me? Did I get so angry because of a bracelet and Amber Mitchell?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was no longer... behaving like himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Drive back to Gregory Residence." George Gregory closed his eyes and said wearily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Amber Mitchell, Amber Mitchell...' Just the thought of the name hurt him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell returned to her place. Looking at the bracelet in her hand, she solemnly put it back in the jewelry box.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Herman, I'll wear this bracelet in a few days and... never take it off again," murmured Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The case would go to trial in two weeks. She had asked Brian to help her find evidence, and with the Moss family looking into the case, it would be difficult for the Gregory family to tamper with the evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell would pay for her crimes this time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she did not know was that George Gregory was looking at a bunch of photos sent to his email in the Gregory family house's study. These photos were taken after he ran into Louise Mitchell today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His facial expressions in the photos were gloomy, ferocious, angry, and helpless. However, out of all those emotions, what he saw on his face the most was&hellip; jealousy! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, jealousy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyone looking at the photos would think he was a man mad with love and jealousy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he jealous of Herman Moss?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was jealous of Amber Mitchell's love for Herman Moss. He was a man who had been dead for so many years, yet he could still occupy such an important place in her heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was only jealous because he loved Amber Mitchell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how reluctant he was, these photos seemed to easily shatter his pretense and make him admit it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, his phone rang. George Gregory said coldly, "I've received the photos. I'll buy all of them. You're not allowed to publish any of them. If I ever see any one of these photos leaked, you can forget about living in peace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes, Mr. Gregory. I won't leak them as long as you're willing to buy them," the person said obsequiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That person was only a small-time reporter who found Amber Mitchell by accident. He wanted to report it at first, but George Gregory unexpectedly showed up, so he took these photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory was willing to pay a lot of money for the photos, which was an unexpected fortune for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, the reporter received the money and smiled with satisfaction. Then, he deleted all the backups from his USB flash drive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he had made a deal with George Gregory. He dared not say one thing and do another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he gave the photos one final glance when he was deleting them. </p></div>
