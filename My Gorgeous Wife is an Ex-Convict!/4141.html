        <h1>Chapter 4139</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Leaning against Chandler's chest, Tina couldn't help but feel her face flush, and her heartbeat seemed to quicken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She really did like Chandler a lot!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the two of them returned to the private room, Tina saw that Kit had already returned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Austin noticed their return and greeted them warmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the meal went on, people began to leave one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler checked the time and said to Tina, "Let's go too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay," Tina nodded, bid farewell to everyone, and finally approached Kit. "I'm leaving now. If you're not feeling well, try not to drink too much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit pressed his lips together and politely said, "Thank you for your concern, Miss Stephenson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The tone he used seemed deliberate, as if he was intentionally creating distance between them, making it feel distant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had thought that after the elevator incident, her relationship with Kit had become closer, and they could even be considered friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But now, it seemed like it wasn't quite the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Exiting the private room, Chandler looked at Tina, who seemed gloomy. "What's wrong? Is it because Kit is upset?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It feels like you can always see through me," Tina sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That was because she was easy to understand, easily displaying her emotions on her face, which was adorable in its honesty!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And him, wasn't he initially attracted to her because of this genuine quality of hers?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was as if in front of her, he never needed to hide himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Because of Kit's attitude towards you?" Chandler asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"A little bit. I thought maybe we could be friends, but it doesn't seem like it, so I feel a bit disappointed," Tina shrugged. "But then, I thought about it again. From the beginning, I liked him as a fan, because I liked his songs, I liked his performances. So, becoming his fan meant being a fan and idol don't necessarily have to be friends, right? Sometimes, maintaining a distance between a fan and an idol might be better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her clarity surprised Chandler a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">I thought she would be upset, but clearly, she has already adjusted her emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"In the future, I'll just continue being a loyal fan. After all, when I became his fan, I never thought about becoming friends with him," Tina said, holding onto Chandler's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler's eyelashes twitched slightly. For him, perhaps this was a stroke of luck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wouldn't become friends with Kit. If she just stayed as a distant fan, then he wouldn't have to worry. One day, maybe this man Kit would steal her away from him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking of this, he couldn't help but scold himself for being so petty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though she has always made it clear that she loves him, why does that sense of unease in his heart still occasionally emerge?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the two of them reached the parking lot, Tina wanted to take out her phone, but suddenly realized that her phone wasn't in her bag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"My phone is still in the private room," she said, then looked up at Chandler and said, "You go get the car, I'll go back to the private room and get my phone. I'll meet you at the hotel entrance later!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After saying that, she turned and hurried back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler watched Tina's hurried figure and couldn't help but furrow his brows.</p></div>
