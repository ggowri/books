        <h1>Chapter 2411</h1>
        <div><p>Her resemblance to Grace was her biggest asset right now, and she was going to take advantage of it.</p><p>Brian said nothing when she did this. Instead, he would sometimes look at her in a trance.</p><p>She secretly rejoiced at this, thinking she was doing the right thing.</p><p>Brian said coldly, &quot;I told you, you&#x27;re only my secretary and nothing more. I don&#x27;t need you to miss me. If you find being a secretary boring, you can quit. Our contract can be annulled. You can leave at any time you want.&quot;</p><p>Whitney Cooper was startled. She quickly looked down and said timidly, &quot;I... I know my place. I won&#x27;t have any inappropriate ideas. It&#x27;s just that... you saved me from that hell hole, so I only want to repay you, Mr. Hart. I know my presence here won&#x27;t necessarily help you with the project here, but I want to learn and expand my knowledge.&quot;</p><p>Whitney Cooper said as she looked up at Brian with those bright almond-shaped eyes of hers.</p><p>She had done her research, so she knew what angle to pose and what look she should show in her eyes to look more like Grace.</p><p>As expected, Brian&#x27;s expression changed slightly. &quot;Go look for Andrea and see if he has anything for you to do. Also, this is my private residence. Don&#x27;t come here without my orders.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I understand, Mr. Hart,&quot; Whitney Cooper said as her eyelashes quivered slightly. She hid the scheming look in her eyes.</p><p>She was still young anyway. She had plenty of time.</p><p>Sooner or later, she would make Brian fall in love with her!</p><p>After Whitney Cooper left, Brian sat back on the couch a little tiredly and raised his hand to cover his eyes, blocking out the light in the room.</p><p>&quot;Grace...&quot; he murmured the word.</p><p>What replied to him was an endless sense of loneliness.</p><p>...</p><p>In the hotel room, Grace told Jason about her investigation in Deer City in the past few days.</p><p>&quot;Amber Mitchell is too pitiful if she was really sent to a mental hospital against her will,&quot; said Grace. There was no difference between being in a mental hospital and being in prison.</p><p>&quot;So? Are you going to help her get out of there?&quot; Jason asked.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, Kyla wants to do that too,” she said. Even if Kyla did not ask her for help, she would have wanted to help the poor woman Amber Mitchell all the same.</p><p>Now that she knew, she could not just sit back and do nothing.</p><p>Grace voluntarily ‘confessed’ that she had lunch with Brian at Whitney Herrera’s request.</p><p>&quot;I only wanted to investigate what had happened to Amber Mitchell and Herman Moss. That&#x27;s all I talked about with Brian.&quot; Grace added in the end.</p><p>&quot;What&#x27;s the matter? Are you afraid I&#x27;ll be jealous?&quot; He looked at her nonchalantly.</p><p>&quot;What about you? Will you be jealous?&quot; Grace asked in reply.</p><p>&quot;That depends on whether you want me to be jealous,&quot; he said. His voice was cold, but it made people blush and their heartbeat quicken.</p><p>Grace&#x27;s face could not help turning red. She quickly changed the subject and said, &quot;By the way, let&#x27;s pick up Jasper and Mick. It&#x27;ll get dark if we delay anymore.”</p><p>The two got up and got dressed. They left their hotel room and went to the Barlow family’s house.</p><p>At the Barlow family’s house, Jasper was teaching William how to fold paper frogs in high spirits.</p></div>
