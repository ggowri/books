        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked at her, hesitated for a moment, and said, "Jasper, I think for the time being, we shouldn't eat together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was taken aback. "Why?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Until we find out who the real culprit is, I don't know who might be targeting me. If you're </span><span>with me, there's a chance that person might redirect their anger towards you," William explained. "Moreover, there are a lot of rumors about me at school right now. If you continue to be with me, you might face criticism as well."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't care about how others criticized him, but he didn't want her to suffer from the same criticism.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to!" Jasper looked directly at the other person and said, "If there's no other reason, let's continue having lunch and dinner together every day!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He furrowed his brows, "Jasper! What I just said..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understood!" Jasper interrupted, "If someone wants to target you, and they're really going to blame me, then I can handle it! Besides, even if I face criticism, so what? If one day it's me who's being criticized, are you planning to stop having meals with me and distance yourself from me to avoid gossip?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He fell silent. Of course he wouldn't do that. If it really happened, he would only protect her even more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, let's not say these unnecessary words anymore," Jasper continued, "Besides, I've never been afraid of criticism since I was a child, and now I'm even less afraid!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's eyelashes trembled slightly, his ink-black pupils reflecting the face in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, when he was a child, he was despised as a criminal. When he was temporarily adopted by the Reed family, the servants and their children all excluded him. Many of the children even intentionally hit him. He was covered in injuries, but didn't know what to do.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was her, fearlessly getting close to him, insisting on being his friend, not allowing others to bully him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was feeling insecure and embarrassed, she gave him great courage, and she made him realize that being alive was a fortunate thing!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I will find the person who posted the message as soon as possible, and I won't let you be in danger!" William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm." Jasper smiled. She believed that he would definitely find the despicable poster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the following days, Jasper openly ate with William at school, went to the library together, and even practiced piano together in the music room, just like usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, there were many people in school gossiping about how Jasper was completely love-struck, yet still continued to be close with William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some people even said that William had put a spell on Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And there were others who said that William's revenge had succeeded, and maybe he was planning to use Jasper to take over the entire Reed family...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In any case, there were all sorts of unpleasant remarks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, these words were only spoken behind Jasper's back, and no one dared to say them directly to her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the eldest princess of the Reed family was not someone ordinary people dared to easily offend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When class ended that day, Jasper received a call from her father. "I'll have the driver pick you up tonight. I heard that there have been a lot of things happening at your school. Don't you want to talk to me about it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper bit her lip lightly. Was her father starting to care about this situation now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the evening, Jasper returned to the Reed House and was immediately summoned to the study by his father after finishing dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in the study, his mother and older brother were also present!</span></p></div>
