        <h1>Chapter 2461</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze. "She left the hospital alone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, she deliberately avoided the security guards. We don't know where she went," the person said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll look for her," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, she called Amber Mitchell's phone number, only to be informed that her phone was switched off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell left the hospital. I don't know where she went," Grace said with a solemn expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did she go back to the Mitchell family house by herself or go to look for George Gregory?" Jason guessed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Both are unlikely. She would be like a sheep going into a tiger's mouth if she returns to the Mitchell family&rsquo;s house, and she probably hates George Gregory now, so she won't take the initiative to meet him." Grace analyzed the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I have someone check the road surveillance to find out where Amber Mitchell went?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That&rsquo;ll probably take some time. But you can check the license plate number of the taxi she got into and ask the driver where he dropped her off," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason then made a phone call and instructed his subordinates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">About 15 minutes later, his subordinates called back and reported that the driver said she got off somewhere near South Mountain Road and Changping Road. The passenger had asked to stop at a corner before she got down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver was worried as it was dangerous for a woman to be alone in the middle of the night in such a remote place. He warned her that a cemetery was not far away, but she did not seem frightened and only said indifferently, "I know that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this answer, Grace's eyes suddenly lit up. "Yes, the Moss family's cemetery! the Moss family's cemetery is just a short walk away. Amber Mitchell must have gone there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Amber Mitchell had said that she wanted to pay her respects to Herman Moss during the day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it possible that she secretly went there because she&rsquo;s impatient?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, Grace said to Jason, "I'll go to the cemetery to look for her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go with you." Jason grabbed Grace and said, "You didn&rsquo;t think I would let you look for her alone at such a late hour, did you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they arrived at the Moss family's cemetery, they found that the lights were on at night, and the security guards at the entrance were on alert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Grace was immediately filled with anxiety. She hurried forward and asked the security guards, "Did something happen inside?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is the Moss family's private cemetery. Please stop here. We have no further comments," a security guard replied coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know Daley Moss. Please inform him to let us in!" Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They looked at her in doubt. They did not seem to have the intention of taking further action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you don't inform him, you&rsquo;ll be held accountable if Daley Moss pursues this matter," said Grace.</p></div>
