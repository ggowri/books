        <h1>Chapter 4056</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Don't you like it when I touch you?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After a moment of contemplation, he asked back, "Do you want to touch me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Didn't I used to touch you a lot when we were kids, especially when we were drawing?" She remembered how she used to touch him a lot when she was drawing, and her hands had been all over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> There was a time when she was interested in drawing, especially the human body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And she only drew handsome men and beautiful women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So he naturally became her model, and her hands were all over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But he never said anything back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "When you were drawing, you were only 10 years old, how is that the same as now?" Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He was already 18 years old back then, not a pervert who would react to a 10-year-old girl's touch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Moreover, at that time, his feelings towards Tina were more like she was his possession, someone he had to be tied to for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> There wasn't much romantic love involved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He just thought she was cute, and this love accumulated slowly as she grew older.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "So you don't see me as a child anymore?" Tina grumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I know better than anyone that you're 20 years old," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In two years, when she graduates from college, it will be the time for her to fulfill their engagement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Then... she will truly be his!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He has been waiting for this day for too long!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "So, if I touch you now, you'll feel it, right?" Tina asked bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As the daughter of the Stephenson family, Hadwin has protected this precious daughter tightly due to the environment. Tina has had Chandler as her nominal fianc&eacute; since she was young, but in reality, he has been like a bodyguard and childhood friend by her side. Therefore, Tina's personality is straightforward and not full of twists and turns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Especially in front of familiar people, she speaks more directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler turned his head and stared at the girl in front of him. "You didn't come here to watch the game today, did you?" At least now, her eyes weren't even on the big screen, but were staring straight at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Hehe..." Tina laughed awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Faced with his sharp gaze, she didn't feel like lying anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "So, what do you want to do by coming to my place tonight?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I want to..." Even though Tina has thick skin, she blushed a little when thinking about her purpose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What?" he asked, his gaze seeming to want to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Alright, just confess!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, Tina didn't have the confidence to continue lying when Chandler was suspicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When they were kids, every time he was suspicious, if she continued to lie, there was only one outcome - being exposed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Without exception!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I just want to have sex with you tonight," Tina admitted honestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As soon as she said this, Chandler's usually calm face showed a rare expression of surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You... want to have sex with me?" Chandler's voice was even lower than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Well, I just... feel like we're engaged, and I don't really know how I feel about you. If I... if we have sex, maybe I'll know," Tina explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Now she felt a bit embarrassed to look at Chandler, not knowing what expression he had on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You don't know how you feel about me?" His hoarse voice rose again.</p></div>
