        <h1>Chapter 625</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," she said and slowly closed her eyes. She felt his fingers gently rubbing and pressing on her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, Jay... Brian seems to really care about that person," muttered Grace. She used to think Brian was a playboy, but this man's insistence on looking for that one woman shook her up a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was looking for a little girl he had met when he was a child. If he met that girl when he was a child, how long had he been looking for that person? Ten years? 20 years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Spending such a long time looking for a person&hellip; This was the kind of persistence many people did not have.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He has been looking for so long. Do you think he'll ever find her?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want him to find her?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope he does, so he won't mistake me for her anymore," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her eyes closed, she did not see the gloom and calculation in Jason's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mistake? No, Brian was not mistaken! However... He would make Brian think that he was mistaken! Grace could only be his. He would not give up Grace to anyone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come to think of it, it's kind of sad that he has to look for substitutes." Grace slowly opened her eyes and looked at Jason. She said, "No matter how many substitutes he finds, what's the point if they're not the one he's looking for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason chuckled. "It's really sad. I hope Brian can find her soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over the next few days, Grace continued to deliver food for the small restaurant, and Kyla was already looking for new food delivery riders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had a lot less work because the recruit had probation for a week.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Nelson knew that Grace was leaving, he held on to Grace for almost as long as she was in the restaurant. He was reluctant to see her leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can always come here to visit you, and if you miss me, you can also ask your Mom to bring you to me. You can call me too. Didn't you memorize my phone number?" said Grace as she stroked the little one's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to see you every day," replied Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a period of training, the little one was well adapted to his cochlear implant. His ability to speak had improved significantly as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although sometimes his pronunciation sounded stiff, he could speak long sentences now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some children his age who started speaking earlier might not speak as well as he did. It was obvious that Nelson had a strong ability to absorb language and was very intelligent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can also video call me. When you miss me, just video call me!" Grace said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace's phone rang. It was a call from Jason. "I'll send someone to pick you up now. I'll be there in about 15 minutes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," replied Grace. He had told her yesterday that he would let her pick out the wedding rings today, so she gave Kyla a heads-up about her working hours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when the car that came to pick her up took her to the jewelry store where she was to meet Jason, Grace was shocked to see the diamond in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was a diamond that had not been set yet, but she had seen this diamond before. She had seen it when she accompanied Sean to attend an auction abroad. The index of this diamond was top-notch, almost flawless. Its name was... Frozen Heart!</p></div>
