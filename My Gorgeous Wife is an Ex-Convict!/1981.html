        <h1>Chapter 1979</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina had been having the time of her life these days. She would accompany her parents around J City during the day as if they were here for a holiday. She even made them a travel itinerary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If it were not for the fact that she was pregnant and could not exhaust herself, she would have gone with her parents to various tourist attractions in J City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had also become a regular to Hadwin Stephenson's office. No one would stop her now. Even her access to Hadwin Stephenson's office became unimpeded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Miss Sweeney, Mr. Stephenson is having a meeting. He said you can go and wait for him in his office if you&rsquo;re here," the secretary said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As soon as Lina entered the office and put down her bag, her phone rang. She picked up the phone and saw that it was a call from Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Speaking of which, she and Anthony Sherman had not talked to each other for quite a while. However, she had texted him when she came to J City to find Hadwin. He even expressed his wishes that she and Hadwin could make up with each other soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yulai, why are you calling me at this hour?" asked Lina. After all, he should be at work right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just... want to ask how you&rsquo;re doing recently. Have you made up with Mr. Stephenson?" Anthony Sherman's voice sounded a little hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I guess so," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"In that case... Then..." Anthony Sherman was hesitant as if he had some difficulty saying it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "What's the matter? Just tell me whatever you have to say. We haven't known each other for long, but we're considered friends."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The other end of the line was silent for a long time. "Lina, you're a good woman. I never wanted to hurt you, but I... I... Anyway, I'm sorry! Lina, I'm so sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Anthony Sherman abruptly ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina stared at her phone, finding it strange. 'What does he mean? Why is he suddenly apologizing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'He hasn&rsquo;t even done anything wrong to me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Lina called him back, wanting to get to the bottom of it. However, there was a busy signal on the other end of the line. Then, his phone was switched off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina frowned, feeling vaguely worried. She called again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was the same as last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Are you calling Anthony Sherman for something?" A voice rang in her ears out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked up, only to see that Hadwin Stephenson had walked into the office and was standing next to her. "Have you finished your meeting?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said, "Yeah. Do you often talk to Anthony Sherman on the phone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His voice sounded jealous. Lina quickly ended the call and said, "Not really. He just called me and said something ambiguous, so I wanted to ask him about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Something ambiguous?" He raised his eyebrows slightly as if he was interested. "What did he say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He asked me how we're doing, told me I'm a good woman, and apologized to me." She was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes glimmered slightly, "You and Anthony Sherman seemed to get to know each other through a blind date, didn&rsquo;t you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His voice sounded faintly dangerous. Lina shuddered and peeked at Hadwin Stephenson. "Well... Does it bother you?"</p></div>
