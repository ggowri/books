        <h1>Chapter 755</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had already bought the items to pay her respects to Grandma, and she did not want to do it with the Lu family. She only wanted to be alone with her grandmother for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the car came to the foot of the hill, instead of letting the driver accompany her, Grace said, "I can go up by myself. I want to be alone with Grandma for a while. Wait for me here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver looked reluctant. "But Mr. Reed said&ndash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll talk to Jason myself later. He won't blame you. Besides, this is where the village's family graves are. It's also daytime, so it&rsquo;s not dangerous," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace spoke, she walked up step by step, carrying all the things she needed to pay her respects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver dared not argue with her and could only wait quietly at the foot of the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace approached her grandmother's grave, her phone rang. It was a call from Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My morning meeting is over. I'll come over now," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take your time. I'm not done here anyway," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing now?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm going to see Grandma at her grave. There are a lot of people in the Lu family's house. It's quiet here, and I can spend some time alone with Grandma. If you've reached the Lu family's house and I'm not back yet, just wait for me for a while," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure. Just ask Driver Li to help you if anything happens," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was a few months older than him. In the beginning, she was the one who took care of him, but now it seemed that he was treating her like a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time the call was over, Grace had also reached her grandmother's grave. She looked at the marble tombstone with her picture on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a black and white picture. Grandma smiled kindly as if she was looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took out the food, wine, incense sticks, and candles, placing them in front of the tombstone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Mom is gone, my brother is gone, and now Grandma's gone too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The family members who love me have left this world one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, I still have Jay. Jason is still by my side, and... Will be my family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason and I will be together forever, and in the future, we'll have children.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her head and looked at her flat stomach. All this time, in addition to nursing the pain in her joints, she had also been working on her womb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor said that she was doing well, and the operation's success rate was high. After the operation was completed, she would be able to get pregnant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had once thought she would never have a chance to be a mother, but now, God had given her a chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If possible, she hoped she could bear him several children and give him a large family. She would be very happy if that happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Facing the tombstone, Grace said to the old woman who was smiling kindly in the picture, "Grandma, I'll be happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Jason was staring dully at the phone in his hand. Terrence, who was beside him, reported, "Mr. Hart and Miss Cummins's cousin, Stella Lindsay, also went back to the Lu family today. Presumably, they've met Miss Cummins."</p></div>
