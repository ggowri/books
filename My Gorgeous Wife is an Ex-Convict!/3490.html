        <h1>Chapter 3488</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's heart sank, while the kidnapper holding her breathed a sigh of relief and even showed a hint of smugness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Jasper from the Reed family escaped, we now have Mason from the same family in our hands. So, what about the ransom...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the kidnappers were relaxed, Mason suddenly moved his wrist and threw a stone, hitting one of the kidnapper's hands. While the kidnapper was in pain, in the next moment, Mason rushed directly towards him. In a split second, he knocked the kidnapper down to the ground with just one blow!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, there were only two sounds of "crack, crack", and the person's wrists were already broken by both hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man was screaming in pain, while Veronica was staring blankly at the scene in front of her. It wasn't until Mason took off his jacket and put it on Veronica that she snapped out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You-" she looked at him, not knowing what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I told you, I will protect Veronica," he said, buttoning up her jacket one by one. "I won't let these people go, especially the one who pointed the gun at you just now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was stunned. After he finished buttoning up her jacket, he turned around and lifted the tied-up bandit with broken hands, then slammed his head hard against a nearby tree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, the bandit's head was bleeding, and Veronica shuddered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He kept pulling the bandit and hitting him against the tree, while the man's cries for mercy became weaker and weaker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Mason's face showed obvious violence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't... don't hit him anymore!" Veronica said. Although the bandit was despicable, if someone died, even the second son of the Reed family would go to jail!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I don't want to let him go," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course... they won't be let go. The police will catch them and make them face the consequences," Veronica said, trembling slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even she herself wasn't sure if the trembling was due to the fear of being forcibly undressed earlier or the sight of the bloody scene before her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As if sensing her discomfort, Mason stopped his hand and said, "Alright, I'll listen to Veronica." He then let go of the person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She lowered her eyes and looked at his pale fingers stained with crimson blood. She thought of when he had protected her by beating up people much older than them who had bullied her. His hands were also stained with blood back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had once told herself to protect him and prevent his hands from being stained with blood, but now... he was still protecting her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason suddenly crouched down with his back facing Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you doing?" She was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm carrying Veronica down the mountain," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... I can walk down the mountain by myself," she said, even though her knee hurt a bit from falling earlier, but it wasn't a problem to walk down the mountain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he maintained this position with Grace, as if he was insisting on something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica pursed her lips and finally crawled onto Mason's back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He slowly stood up and walked down the mountain with a burden on his back.</p></div>
