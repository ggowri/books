        <h1>Chapter 1844</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Whenever she looked into her son&rsquo;s eyes, which were similar to hers, she could not help but feel afraid. They were sharp and calm as if he could see through her at any time. She could also feel him silently rebuking her for what she had done back then. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The doctor said that you need to be hospitalized for about a week. We'll return to L City after a week. No one will know about all this," said Old Lawyer Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts nodded gently. She probably would not return to Emerald City after going back to L City. "Milo, I want to visit Kim's tomb before I leave. I... I've never felt more sorry for anyone in my life. I want to apologize to him personally."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts said, "Let... Let's tell Grace that, then. There shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. Just keep your emotions in check and don't let them sense anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the hospital's blood laboratory, someone carefully handed Terrence a blood sample. "This is what you wanted."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Good. Don't let anyone find out about this," warned Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes... Yes, got it," they answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence took the blood sample and got back to his car. He dialed Jason's phone number. "Young master Reed, we have the blood sample."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, stick to the plan," Jason said coldly and ended the call. Those dark peach blossom eyes fell on the stack of papers that were spread out in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This was information on Mrs. Watts. Mrs. Watts's name was... Tang Yihui. It was not his mother's name, but the last name was the same as his mother's. It was... a name he hated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Strangely enough, they could only find out information up till 25 years ago. Much of the information before that had not been preserved due to the lack of technology back then, so nothing beyond that timeframe could be found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'25 years ago...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moreover, the papers also stated that Tang Yihui had been in and out of plastic surgery hospitals many times 25 years ago. It was said that she underwent facial plastic surgery because a robber disfigured her during a robbery attempt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, they could not find photos of her before her plastic surgery. Even the hospital records were gone. It was as if someone had deliberately gotten rid of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Could Tang Yihui be... the woman I'm looking for?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though there was no real evidence, the investigation results in front of him only reinforced his suspicions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, he sent Terrence to the hospital to get Mrs. Watts's blood sample. Doing a DNA test on the blood sample would tell him the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They would find out whether this woman was the woman he had been looking for!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Knock! Knock!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There were suddenly a few knocks on the door. Jason instantly came back to his senses after realizing he had fallen into a trance just now. A faint sense of fear rose in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What am I afraid of? Am I afraid that Mrs. Watts is really the mother I&rsquo;ve been looking for who abandoned me? Am I afraid of facing that woman again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Or maybe I'm just afraid of... Grace's choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What would Grace do when the time comes?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Come in," said Jason as he put away the documents spread out on his desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace walked in when the door opened, and Jason froze. He was just thinking about her, and here she was.</p></div>
