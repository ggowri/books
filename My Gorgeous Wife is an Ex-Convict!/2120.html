        <h1>Chapter 2118</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It doesn't matter now whether it was love at first sight," Kyla said flatly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just want you to know that I fell in love with you from the very beginning," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That only proves that that's all to your love," she said and walked past Martin Weiss again, intending to head for the bus stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss yanked Kyla. "I'll take you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks. I can do it myself&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He interrupted her and said, "Are you going to take the bus? There are a lot of people at the bus stop here. You're a pregnant woman. Will you get on a crowded bus? Aren't you worried that you'll throw up? Since we're husband and wife now, isn't it a matter of fact that I take you home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We only got the marriage license for the children. We're not husband and wife at all. Martin Weiss, you're not going back on your word, are you?" Kyla said nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stared at her. "Do you think I'm the kind of person who goes back on their word?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He muttered, "You only got the marriage license with me for the sake of the children, so I'm not your husband to you, but... Kyla, you know what? To me, you're my wife, my one and only wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze and looked somewhat blankly at the person in front of her. His voice was low and somewhat hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's words somehow made her heart clench a little, causing a small pang of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His voice continued to ring in her ears. "Also, if you really want a divorce one day, I&rsquo;ll do it as long as you ask. You don't have to worry that you'll be stuck in this marriage forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though... he really wished that marriage could bind her and keep her with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">While Kyla was in a trance, Martin Weiss had taken her to the car. He put her in the front passenger seat and bent over to fasten her seat belt carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah!" She snapped back to her senses and saw his magnified face in before her. "You..." She was so caught off guard that her cheeks flushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked at the blush on her cheeks and seemed to see the old her as he fell into a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His proximity and intimacy had always made her cheeks blush with shyness and joy. He would even deliberately do something just to see her blush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, I&rsquo;ll make you trust me again one day," said Martin Weiss before straightening up and returning to the driver's seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could not be impatient. Since he was the one who broke her trust, he was willing to piece it all back together. No matter how long it took, even if it would take a lifetime, he would do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze. 'Should I trust him again? Trust in what? Trust that he actually loves me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But how is that possible?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had once trusted him with all her heart, and she ended up in jail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She never wanted to go through that hopelessness again.</p></div>
