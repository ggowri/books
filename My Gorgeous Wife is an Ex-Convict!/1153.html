        <h1>Chapter 1152</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at him indifferently before saying lightly, "Do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No..." Grace basically rushed in front of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew the thing she should do now was to get out of here and stay out of this, but&hellip; Perhaps the scene reminded her of the time when her fingernails got pulled out and the pain she had felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, there had been no one to help her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she could do was bear the heart-clenching pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He slowly raised those beautiful peach blossom eyes, his cold gaze falling on Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When her eyes met his gaze, her thin body shuddered again. His eyes were too cold and icy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like a bottomless cold pond. The deeper she looked into his eyes, the colder she felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No?" Jason stood up slowly. Looking at her coldly from a commanding position, he said, "Who are you to say no to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body trembled. The person in front of her was not the Jason she knew, not even Jay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was now Emerald City's Master Reed, and she was just an ant in his eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think it's easy to pull out a person's fingernails and you can pull them out as you please?" asked Grace as she took a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was pale under the lamplight, and she was trembling a little. However, her almond-shaped eyes were staring straight at the person in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason narrowed his eyes, and he seemed to be filled with a sense of danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick hurried forward and began to smooth things over, saying, "Well... By the way, I asked Grace about her relationship with Brian when I brought her here. She said they have nothing to do with each other and that the video online is just a misunderstanding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said lazily, "Patrick, did you bring her here today just to talk about this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he was asking Patrick, Jason's eyes were fixed on Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick could only smile awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "Then you'd better remember never to bring her to me again, and don't even mention her name in front of me. Otherwise, don't blame me for disregarding our years of friendship!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was stunned. 'Jason would never say such a thing because of a woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now, Jason is saying it like he&rsquo;s utterly disgusted by Grace. Has he really gotten over&hellip; Grace?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, did it not show just how much Grace occupied his heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a woman dressed in the club&rsquo;s waitress uniform stepped forward and said, "Mr. Reed, I appreciate you standing up for me, but... there's no need for you to quarrel with your friends for a nobody like me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The waitress held her right hand with her left hand, and her right hand's index finger was wrapped in gauze. The white gauze was faintly stained with blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason turned to the waitress and said, "If I don't think you're a nobody, then you're not a nobody." He took her right hand as he spoke. "Does your finger still hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the cold voice was merely inquiring, it surprised the waitress. The other people around her cast her an envious look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was Master Reed interested in her? It was even more enviable than hitting the jackpot!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was probably what they called reaching heaven in a single bound!</p></div>
