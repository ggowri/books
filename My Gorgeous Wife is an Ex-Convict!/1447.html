        <h1>Chapter 1446</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... was hoping Grace could persuade you, but... I was afraid... Afraid that she couldn&rsquo;t. So... I couldn't help coming in. I know you don't want to see me and won&rsquo;t bother using my liver, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He paused and spoke as if he was exhausting all his strength to utter these words. "I beg you to have the operation. As long as you have the operation, I won't appear in front of you anymore. You&rsquo;ll never see me again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He only wanted her to live. As long as she survived, everything else did not matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at him and said, "If I proceed with the operation, it'll be dangerous for you too. Do you have any conditions?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her tone was calm. It was as if they were only talking about a deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Conditions?' Martin Weiss's eyes widened immediately. "Are... Are you willing to have the operation?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes..." She wanted to take a chance for her son and mother, "You can tell me whatever conditions you have. I don't want to owe you anything. But if I die on the operating table or suffer transplant rejection, then I may not be able to fulfill your conditions."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He said agitatedly, "No! You're not going to die! Your body won&rsquo;t reject it. You donated me your bone marrow, so the blood in my body is produced by your bone marrow. Our blood is the same. There's no way you'll suffer from transplant rejection!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In other words, his liver was the most suitable liver for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What about your conditions?" It was all she wanted to know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His lips trembled. 'Conditions? Does she know that my only condition is for her to stay alive? As long as she's alive, I'm willing to cut off no matter how much of my liver!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There&rsquo;s no condition. Don't worry about what you owe me because I owe you this. You donated me your bone marrow, so I'm giving you my liver now. Take it as compensation," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn murmured, "Really? In that case, we don't owe each other anymore. After the surgery, let's... not see each other anymore. Martin Weiss, I just want to live the rest of my life in peace and not get involved with you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He trembled and gave a sad smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He already knew that maybe it was the end of him and her, but... when he really heard it from her, he still felt a fit of pain in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The person he loved the most had completely kicked him out of her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, we won't owe each other anymore." He stared at her steadily, and his hoarse voice said, "But... you can come looking for me anytime if you ever encounter any trouble you can't solve. I'll do anything to help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Kyla Corbyn did not respond. She just closed her eyes slowly as if nothing else he said mattered to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn's liver transplant took place soon after Martin Weiss and Kyla Corbyn performed the necessary pre-operation tests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lying on the cold operating table, Martin Weiss heard the anesthesiologist say, "Mr. Weiss, I'm going to inject you with the anesthetic now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," he answered. He had no fear but only anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'My liver can finally be transplanted into Kyla. Even if anything goes wrong and I die on the operating table, I just hope I can save Kyla's life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I owe her too much. I have no way to make up for it even if I use my life.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Slowly closing his eyes, Martin Weiss felt the slight tingling sensation of the anesthetic needle piercing his body. He felt something slowly flowing into his body...</p></div>
