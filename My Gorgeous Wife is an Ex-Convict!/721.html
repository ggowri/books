        <h1>Chapter 720</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lowered his body and dropped to his knees before her, gently taking off her high heels. Then, he grabbed her feet with his hands. "Grace, the only person in this world who can dominate me is you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he finished his speech, he lowered his head and kissed the instep of her foot&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace let out a gasp. He looked... Just like he was making a vow. It was as if he was putting his life in her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her foot instantly began to burn like hell, and she could feel his lips clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried to say something, but her throat was horribly dry. When he looked up, his bright eyes were staring at her with endless flirtation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she know that I can give her everything as long as she doesn't betray me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she know that I love her so much until I'm no longer myself? I never knew I&rsquo;d be so perturbed and so confused over a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she also know that I can show my best side only to her? I&rsquo;d only flirt and tempt her alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She can make me do whatever she wants.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, don't leave me." The words rose from his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, he was stunningly beautiful. He was so beautiful that one could not look away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could I not want him when he&rsquo;s like that? Even with just a faint smile, I&rsquo;m totally screwed.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay..." She raised her hands and took the initiative to attach her body to his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to dominate him, she just wanted to make each other better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Grace bought some toys and went to the small restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson spotted her. His beautiful eyes were full of joy as he cried out in his babyish voice, "Aunty, I miss you so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one now had no problems with pronunciation and speech. He began to be fluent in speaking and even spoke better than a normal child of the same age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was already intelligent, and as soon as his ears could hear, he was like a sponge when it came to learning the language. Then through language, he learned what he had never known before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry, I had so many things to deal with and it&rsquo;s only now that I've come to see you, Nelson." Grace gave the toys to Nelson, making the little one even happier. He said thank you and took the initiative to kiss her on the cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Nelson interacted for a long time, then Kyla asked Mrs. Corbyn to take Nelson to a small park near the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Congratulations on reversing your case," said Kyla. Even if Grace did not say anything about it, she had seen it on the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you? When are you going to clear your name?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Me?" Kyla was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've seen your case and trial records. There were many questionable points in your case, and what mattered most back then was the witness' testimony," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days, she had studied Kyla's case several times and felt a growing suspicion toward the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as they defended her using the principle, innocent until proven guilty, it was not impossible to win the lawsuit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled sadly. 'The witness' testimony... It was Martin Weiss's testimony!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That man sent her to prison with his testimony!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right, Grace. Thank you for your kindness, but I don't want to reverse the case. I'm out of jail now, and it doesn't matter to me whether I reverse it or not," said Kyla.</p></div>
