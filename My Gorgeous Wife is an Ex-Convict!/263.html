        <h1>Chapter 262</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She raised her head in shock, looking into Jason's rippling eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea's face paled as she gave a hollow laugh. "I didn't know Mr. Reed... loves Grace so much. Do you have any plans to get married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If she's willing to marry me, of course I&rsquo;ll marry her," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt her heart twitching wildly as she stared at Jason in disbelief as if she had just heard something unbelievable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How is that possible?!" Andrea blurted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lazily glanced at Andrea. "What's impossible?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were so cold that Andrea could not help but tremble while fear seemed to rise from the bottom of her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. Let's go, Grace." Jason walked away holding Grace's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed Jason with no objections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tyler Barber looked at Andrea and said disapprovingly, "Andrea, why did you mention that your friend went to prison? Fortunately, Mr. Reed already knows about it. If he didn&rsquo;t, it will embarrass them both. They may even break up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I did it on purpose!' Andrea said bitterly in her heart. When she saw Jason&rsquo;s cup of coffee that was left on the table, she saw that he had only taken a sip of this expensive coffee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmph. I think her boyfriend is not as good as he looks. He only took a sip of the coffee before he stopped drinking it. I&rsquo;m guessing he has never had a good cup of coffee before and doesn't know how to enjoy the good things." Andrea felt that her guess was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man who did not mind if a woman had been to prison before and was even willing to marry a sanitation service worker was probably just a loser. His only saving grace was that he was pretty good looking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you say that about other people, Andrea." Tyler Barber frowned slightly. He did not like his girlfriend to talk about her friends like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea paid no attention to it. She just called the waiter and tried to pick up the bill, but the waiter said, "Your bill has been paid by the other gentleman's subordinate earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Subordinate?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea blinked her eyes. The man named Jason had subordinates? Why did they not see them just now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He... even paid the bill? It was not cheap. Although it was just several cups of coffee, it was still close to 1000 dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The average working-class could not afford it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did the guy just pay the bill without saying anything?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who the hell was this man? Was he showing off or was he actually rich? As Andrea thought about this, her expression became more distorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, once Jason and Grace walked out of the shopping mall, Grace suddenly said, "I won't take what you said just now to heart. I know you said it on purpose for Andrea to hear."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your former colleague is not that great," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had nothing to say. If she and Jason were really lovers, then what Andrea said just now was clearly meant to create trouble.</p></div>
