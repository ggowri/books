        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that, she turned to leave, yet Brian lunged forward and stopped Grace. "Wait! You're not disturbing us, and there's no need to be in such a hurry to avoid me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a pause, Brian said, "You must be here to see Dr. Russell about your hands. How have they been these years? Are they alright? Do they still ache?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was unconcealable concern in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Hart, thank you for your concern, but I want to talk to Dr. Russell alone about the condition of my hands," said Grace. She was also rejecting Brian's concern by saying that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian paled slightly before saying with a sad smile, "Okay, stay here. I'll leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He walked out of the consulting room as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Russell looked at Grace and said, "Lil Cummins, Brian is just concerned about you. He thought a lot about you during the five years you were gone. He always talks about you when he's here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They were also talking about her earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Dr. Russell, I'm Jason's wife now. The more he&rsquo;s concerned about me, the more troublesome it is for both of us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Russell sighed. "I don't know when he'll get over it either. Enough about that. Let's look at your hands. We suspended your treatment back then because you were pregnant. Look at how long we've put it on hold. Your hands must have hurt a lot over the years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace smiled ruefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Russell looked grim after taking Grace's X-ray and doing a few more tests in the clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Is there a problem?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I told you at the beginning of the treatment that stopping treatment before its completion will only aggravate your injuries. You&rsquo;ve come to me again after stopping treatment for so many years. I can only say that it&rsquo;ll be very difficult to cure your hands. Your hands will be crippled in three years, at most."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Crippled?" Grace trembled. Her face seemed shocked, but she was not afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Do you think there's a cure for your hands?" asked Dr. Russell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace shook her head. "Dr. Russell, you're the expert in this. Since you've said so, then I think it's very likely that they're going to be crippled. And... you indeed warned me of the possible consequences when I was pregnant and wanted to stop my treatment. I'm prepared to accept the consequences of the choice I made."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her hands would often ache in recent years. It had gotten more frequent, especially in the past year. She would usually take painkillers to relieve the pain, but it was not a permanent solution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had also been to major hospitals in L City. The doctors there also told her something similar. It was just that they were much more subtle with their words than Dr. Russell. They said her hands could not be cured with drugs and she could not undergo surgery either. She could only take good care of her hands to prolong the duration before her hands went numb.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she asked how many years she had left before her hands would lose all feeling, the doctors in L city had said vaguely, "If nothing goes wrong, maybe 10 years, 20 years, or more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... they had never given her an exact figure like Dr. Russell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Somewhat surprised, Dr. Russell said, "So you're smart enough to remember the choice you made."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Can I keep them?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Russell said, "It depends. Do the treatment now and if you're lucky, you can keep your hands. If you're not, your hands will be crippled on the spot. You won't even have three years."</p></div>
