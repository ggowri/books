        <h1>Chapter 3039</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Is Brian looking at Jason, as if they are willing to live and die together?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So what about him? With whom can he share life and death? If one day Valda really faces danger, will he make the same choice as Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The meal came to an end and the children had finished playing. Jasper mentioned that they were going to the zoo tomorrow to see the animals. Simon asked, "Can I come along tomorrow too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So in the end, a few people decided to go to the zoo together tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, when George came to pick up Simon, Valda briefly explained tomorrow's schedule to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can Simon join us to the zoo tomorrow? Are you available?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without waiting for George to speak, Simon said, "I want to go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wants to go to the zoo not just because he wants to go with Jasper and the others, but also because Auntie Grace will talk to him about his mom and he wants to hear more about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George looked at his son and they locked eyes for a moment. After a while, George looked away first and said, "I'll have to trouble you both again tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's okay, I'm actually quite happy to take Simon out today!" said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George left with Simon, and Valda murmured, "One wrong step can lead to a series of wrong steps."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you suddenly saying this?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just feel like there's a distance between Simon and George, and George looks so lifeless now. If he hadn't been suspicious and had believed Amber's words, they would be happy now," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead, they are separated and suffering, and their children are also in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"One wrong step leads to a series of wrong steps?" Brian murmured. He would never let himself end up like George! "Okay, let's rest early. We have to get up early tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, in the Barlow House, Jasper was in William's room, propping his cheek and looking at him strangely. "William, are you unhappy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," William answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But why do I feel like you're not happy?" Jasper muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William pursed his lips. "What would you do if I'm not happy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, it's to make you happy," said Jasper naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William bit his small lips with his teeth and remained silent for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper blinked his eyes and said, "You're really unhappy, aren't you? Why is that? Can you tell me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She feels very happy today and even met Simon, who wants to learn how to play the piano! However, even though she is so happy, William is not happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you... like that Simon?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I like it," Jasper nodded his little head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But her response clearly added a few more points to his unhappiness, "Why?"</p></div>
