        <h1>Chapter 1604</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Old Master was kind to me. Even though he&rsquo;s passed away, I'm willing to be his dog!" replied Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So what on earth happened? Why did you bring Mick back after Grace disappeared? What did you do when Grace left the Reed family? Did Old Master tell you to do all these too?" Jason asked sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at Jason, Secretary Wang knew he must be saying all this because he had not recovered all the memories he lost after the hypnosis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he had recovered his memory, he would not be asking that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As for Grace? Since she could return to the Reed family, she must have recovered some of her memories. Even if she had not recovered all of them, Terrence and the rest would probably have explained it to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But she probably didn't tell Young master Reed about her falling into the sea. Is she scared that Young master Reed won&rsquo;t be able to take it after he finds out?' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang had always been insightful. He had pretty much figured it out after just hearing a few words from Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, he had arranged for Jason's hypnosis. He was clear that it would probably be too much for him if they forcibly triggered his lost memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had also told Terrence and the rest that they should not mention the incident of Grace falling into the sea unless Jason recalled it himself so as not to trigger him too much. They would only end up ruining things themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It seemed that Terrence and the rest had followed his advice well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you really want to know what I did, Young master Reed?" Secretary Wang smirked playfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace shuddered and instantly shouted, "No!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Both Jason and Secretary Wang immediately turned to look at her. However, Jason's eyes were full of confusion while Secretary Wang seemed to be well-aware.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Stunned, Grace hesitated a little before saying, "I'm just scared that he'll deliberately make something up to deceive you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you're worried that'll I make something up, why ask me then?" Secretary Wang looked at Grace mockingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's hands that were by her sides clenched the hem of her skirt. She hated Secretary Wang but also did not understand him. Since she was rescued, it was most likely Secretary Wang who had saved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Why did he save her even though he was supposed to be following the old master's orders to get rid of her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you let two of the children live, you would&rsquo;ve let the other little one live too, wouldn&rsquo;t you?" Grace choked up as she said, "Secretary Wang, you aren't such a cold-blooded person. Since you were benevolent back then, please tell me the whereabouts of the child. Whatever that has happened, we'll let bygones be bygones if you just tell us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She just wanted her family to reunite safely!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Secretary Wang was unmoved by Grace's plea. "Let bygones be bygones? I'll give the child to the Reed family, but you must never show up in front of Young master Reed. Will you agree to that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as he said that, Grace's expression changed and Jason immediately pressed Secretary Wang against the wall. "Shut up! If you dare say such a thing again, I'll kill you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you scared, Young master Reed? Are you scared that the woman beside you will agree to my request and disappear before you for the sake of the child?" Secretary Wang asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's face became utterly pale, and he was trembling so much that even his hands shook while they pressed on Secretary Wang.</p></div>
