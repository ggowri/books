        <h1>Chapter 2039</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn had inherited Kyla and Martin Weiss's best features. Even though Nelson Corbyn had a hearing defect, many girls in school had confessed to him or sent him love letters. One could imagine how good-looking he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even Lina said Nelson would attract many women when he grew up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Juliet's hand touched Nelson Corbyn's hearing aid. The little one curiously wanted to take it to see what it was. Chase Harper hurriedly stopped her and said, "Juliet, don't play with Brother Nelson's hearing aid!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Juliet seemed frightened by her father's sudden shout, and she stiffened immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson patted Juliet and said, "I can't hear without this, so I can't casually take it off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Juliet asked in confusion, "You can't hear? You won&rsquo;t be able to hear without this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah," answered Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Suddenly, Juliet's expression seemed even more nervous than Chase Harper's just now. "Then you must take good care of this thing and not lose it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay." Nelson Corbyn smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before Chase Harper left with his daughter, he exchanged phone numbers with Grace and Kyla. He also learned that Kyla had opened a store next to Nelson Corbyn's primary school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Juliet said reluctantly to Nelson Corbyn, "Can I still play with you in the future? I&rsquo;ll protect your hearing aid and not lose it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one became particularly worried about the hearing aid after learning that Nelson Corbyn had lost it before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn's beautiful eyes looked at Juliet. 'A girl who&rsquo;s only three years old is trying to... protect my hearing aid?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, we'll play in the future," whispered Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once Juliet and Chase Harper left, Grace, Kyla, and Nelson came to the private room in the restaurant that Lina had booked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Kyla also gave Lina their respective wedding gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace gave her a crystal lamp. When you turned it on, the shadow was the silhouette of two people embracing each other. It was very delicate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla handed Lina a small gift box. Lina opened it and saw a jade pendant that was very clear and bright. You could tell it was a good piece of jade, probably costing about tens of thousands of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The money was certainly not a small sum for Kyla, so Lina hurriedly said, "Kyla, your gift is too expensive. You don't have to give me such an expensive&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I bought this a long time ago. I thought it carried a good meaning. Now, I'm giving it to you to wish you a happy marriage," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She bought the jade pendant in the hopes that she and Martin Weiss could have a happy future. Now, it was great that Lina could live out the dream she could never realize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing Lina still hesitating, Kyla said, "I'll be sad if you don't accept it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina could not reject Kyla anymore and accepted her jade pendant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was shocked to learn that Kyla, Grace, and Nelson had run into Chase Harper in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Chase Harper has a daughter named Juliet. She's quite cute and clung to Nelson," said Grace.</p></div>
