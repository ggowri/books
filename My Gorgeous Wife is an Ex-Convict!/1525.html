        <h1>Chapter 1523</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, just then, Jason blurted out a cold statement, "I don't like others simply touching me. If you have the guts to do so, then get ready to lose your hand the next day.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was such a faint comment yet it sounded so casual. It was so frightening that it made everyone feel a terrifying chill go down their backs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, his eyes were not focused on her. He had his head lowered and was looking at the documents in his hands. It was as if he was not bothered to even look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace dared not take on the bet with her hand on the line. After all, she was very aware that a man like Jason would definitely keep his word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Such a man is way too proud and cold. It's like no one can get close to him.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Grace was intending to get close to Jason and even boldly placed her hand on his face! While Irene Lynch was astonished and jealous at the same time, she also cruelly hoped that Grace&rsquo;s hand would be chopped off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Nevertheless, what made her even more surprised was that Terrence suddenly called out, "Young Madam!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was stunned. 'Young Madam? Who is he referring to? Didn&rsquo;t Young master Reed's wife die a long time ago?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch snapped out and suddenly thought about the woman in front of her. &lsquo;She shares the same name as Jason's late wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Could it be&hellip; that this young madam he's referring to&hellip;' Her eyes opened wide. If she was feeling astonished earlier, then she now felt as though she was about to pass out cold. Her face immediately became pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'No. It's impossible that this woman is Young master Reed's wife!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace placed her gaze on Terrence. "Terrence, long time no see!" She answered Terrence, who greeted her as &lsquo;Young Madam&rsquo; earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The people surrounding them all took in deep breaths. Despite all of them having different thoughts, the scene before them still made them flabbergasted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence looked at Grace, feeling agitated. "You're not dead, you're still alive!" They did not expect the miracle that they had all looked forward to countless times to actually be fulfilled after five years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, I'm not dead," said Grace. "Back then, what happened&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she was halfway done talking, she felt a painful sensation on her wrist. Jason's fingers were grabbing onto her wrist. She turned around and found herself being stared at by those deep almond eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was staring at her and giving off an intimidating vibe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who are you?" The cold voice was heard coming from his sexy lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace bit on her lip. "I'm Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who exactly are you?" He was staring right at her as if he was about to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She looked straight into his eyes and said once more, "I&rsquo;m your wife, Jay. It's been five years since we last met and you can't recognize me already? Haven&rsquo;t you missed me in the past five years?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Five years&hellip; She had forgotten about him for five years. "I'm sorry to have made you wait for five years. If only I had been able to remember you much earlier, I would've come to meet you sooner as well," said Grace. Fortunately, she eventually remembered him. Five years was not considered too long. They still had a lot of time to spend together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stared at the woman&rsquo;s face which he had seen on the marriage certificate before. When he heard her say, "If only I had been able to remember you much earlier," he suddenly heard a voice in his mind saying, "If I had met you much earlier, knew about it earlier, and fallen in love with you earlier, then I wouldn't have made you suffer this much. I wouldn&rsquo;t have just turned a blind eye&hellip;"</p></div>
