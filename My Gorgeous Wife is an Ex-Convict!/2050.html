        <h1>Chapter 2048</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked at her son. "Do you like Juliet very much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn said, "Yeah, Juliet's cute. Just like Jasper. Perhaps Juliet and Jasper would become good friends if they met."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Maybe. Alright, you haven't finished your homework today, have you? Hurry and do your homework," Kyla said to her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once Nelson went to his room to do his homework, Mrs. Corbyn walked to her daughter and said, "Chase's nice. It's inconvenient for a man to take care of his daughter. You and him..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, are you trying to matchmake us again? Is that why you deliberately asked Chase to stay for dinner today?" Kyla said as she seemed to see through her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just want you two to spend more time together. You'll only have feelings for each other after spending time together," said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla smiled. She had fallen in love with Martin Weiss at first sight! She always thought she would fall in love with someone at first sight. Otherwise, she would not fall in love even if they knew each other for a long time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her heart was full of sarcasm when she thought of Martin Weiss. "Mom, I'm going to take out the garbage. Don't worry about me. I only think of Chase as a friend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Kyla headed outside with a bag of trash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The night breeze outside made her cheeks feel a little cold, causing her to wince. She knew that her mother was afraid it would be hard for her to raise Nelson alone after her mother died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it was hard for her to imagine herself with another man for the rest of her life. It was as if all her love had been exhausted when she was imprisoned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just as Kyla threw out the garbage and was walking back to the store, someone suddenly yanked her wrist from behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah!" she exclaimed. Then, she staggered and was dragged aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next moment, she was thrown into the back of a car and a body got on top of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The familiar scent shocked Kyla. 'This is...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before she could speak, he kissed her lips. The eager kiss seemed to be trying to prove something, leaving Kyla almost breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was no light in the narrow car compartment. It was dim as only moonlight was shining through the car window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla struggled to push him away, but she could not push him away with her strength. The man grabbed her hands and pressed down on her. She could not move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The air was thick with lust. Sometime later, he finally ended the kiss. His lips were pressed against the corner of her lips, and a hoarse voice rang out in the car compartment. "Are you planning to be with Chase Harper?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla trembled. 'This voice... belongs to Martin Weiss!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She stood still as she watched the face so close to her slightly raise. The moonlight from the window fell on his face, making it half-dim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His face displayed a complicated combination of obsession, struggle, pain, and jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In response, Kyla yanked her hand away from his and slapped him hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A loud slap rang out in the car compartment. Martin Weiss's face was slapped sideways, while Kyla felt a burning pain in her palm.</p></div>
