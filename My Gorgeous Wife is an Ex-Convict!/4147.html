        <h1>Chapter 4145</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit picked up the phone and saw that it was his father calling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Without even thinking, he knew what his father wanted to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just hold on a little longer, he told himself, as long as he can endure until he has enough ability to earn more money and pave the way for his future, then he can break free from his father's control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He answered the call, and sure enough, his father's voice came through the phone, "What's wrong with you? Didn't I tell you to entertain Mr. Perkins properly? Why did Mr. Perkins say you're ignorant? And what's going on with the Stephenson family's young lady and Chandler?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because Mr. Perkins was vague in his complaint on the phone, Edmond had to call and ask himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "When Mr. Perkins acted inappropriately towards me, Miss. Stephenson happened to witness it, so she gave him a beating. Then Mr. Hunter came to find Miss. Stephenson and saw the scene." Kit answered simply and clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> There was silence on the other end of the phone, and after a while, his father spoke again, "What about Miss. Stephenson..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Miss. Stephenson seemed to have heard Mr. Perkins mention your name, so she also knows that you asked me to entertain him in order to gain better resources." Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He could almost imagine how ugly his father's face must be at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Actually, if he could, he really didn't want Tina to know about this. He hoped that in her eyes, he would still be glamorous and bright, still the shining one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But now, he had presented the rotten thing beneath that glamour in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Stay in your room for the next two days and don't come out!" Edmond said these words and hung up the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit shrugged and casually threw the phone aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Anyway, he had planned to stay here and heal for the next two days, not going anywhere!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Closing his eyes, he suddenly chuckled at himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> People, they always unconsciously become greedy, even if they clearly know that it's something they can't obtain, they still greedily want to have it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> ------------</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The next day, Tina pestered her mother, "Mom, what do you think of Kit?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "That celebrity you had a scandal with?" Lina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina blushed, "Yes, him. Look, this is his poster, this is his music video, and this is his costume for acting. How is he? Isn't he great?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She presented her mother with a stack of materials related to Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It's quite good," Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, as a senior member of the star-chasing clan, Lina had a discerning eye and the right to speak on this matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I think with his talent, he will continue to develop and improve in the future. Mom, do you feel the same?" Tina added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina looked at her daughter, "Tell me, what do you really want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina smirked, just as expected, a mother knows her daughter best! "I think White Maple Group should sign him as their spokesperson while Kit's value is still low."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina raised her eyebrows, "I won't oppose you if you want to be a fan, but if you want to associate fan culture with White Maple Group, then don't blame me for objecting!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina knew that she was being somewhat stubborn and irrational, but she said, "Mom, I just want to give Kit some resources so that he doesn't have to lose out on valuable things because of a lack of resources."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She didn't want to see a scene like yesterday again.</p></div>
