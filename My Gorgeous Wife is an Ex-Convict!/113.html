        <h1>Chapter 112</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe almost fainted.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had not been expecting the reason for her suffering such a serious injury to be that Jason had wanted to vent Grace's anger for her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Why was it Grace?!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the past, Jennifer Atkinson had been a famous beauty! As for Grace... Well, even if Zoe admitted that Grace was a good-looking woman, after three years of imprisonment, she was now a street sweeper. Without maintaining her looks at all in those years, how beautiful could she be?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">How could Jason, who had gotten used to beautiful women, be interested in Grace?!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So don't go and make trouble for Grace anymore," Sean warned his sister. "Also, you'd better bury what I said to you today in your heart. Don't say it to anyone. Not even your parents! Jason said that he doesn't want others to know about it. Me telling you this today is already a big mistake."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe stopped talking. If it had been someone else, she could still have found a way to vent her anger. But if it was Jason... if she really provoked this person, the Stevens family might not be able to stay in Emerald City anymore.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That person...some said that he was the king of Emerald City, some said that he was the god of war in the business world, and some said that he was simply... crazy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was said that there was once a woman who had bought out a hotel manager and acquired the details of the room number along with a set of spare keys for his room in the hotel because she wanted to get close to him. She wanted to have a romantic encounter.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As a result, the woman was wrapped in bedsheets and thrown directly out onto the road outside of the entrance of the hotel. Later, the woman's family business started encountering trouble everywhere. The daughter of an originally-rich family became a pauper in less than a year, and she could only sell herself in a nightclub to make a living.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for the hotel manager who had been bribed, it was said that no one saw him in Emerald City ever again. Some said that he had left the city, some said that he died, and some said that he was kidnapped by a human trafficker to do menial labor.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In short, there were all kinds of rumors about what had happened.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">All in all, Jason was definitely a vicious person. If she offended him, she would drag her entire family down with her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was also after the incident that many of the notable socialites in the city no longer dared to target Jason.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although Jason was physically attractive and rich, who wanted to take that risk? After all, the socialite who had become a nightclub lady had become the subject of jokes and served as a warning to these Emerald City socialites.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Did you hear me?" Sean asked again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I... I know. It's no big deal. I just won't mess with Grace in the future," Zoe said reluctantly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe took a few awkward steps and left the garden. Sean turned to Lily and said, "Let's go back to the hall."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, at that moment, Lily's brows were tightly knitted together, and her expression was extremely unsightly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's wrong? You can't accept that Jason fell for Grace?" Sean asked. After all, Grace had killed Jennifer Atkinson in the past.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you think... that Jason might reopen the case for Grace?" Lily asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Reopen the case?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"After all, with Jason's abilities, it would not be impossible for him to clear Grace's name. If Grace's case were really reopened, then my sister's death..." Lily gritted her teeth and clenched her fist tightly as her body trembled.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't think too much. Do you think it will be so easy to reverse the court's verdict? All the evidence back then pointed to her. Even if Jason wanted to reverse the verdict for her, I'm afraid it wouldn't be easy." Sean patted his fiance&#769;e's shoulder and comforted her. "What's more, Jason is just acting on the spur of the moment. With Grace's status, it'll be impossible for her to marry into the Reed family. I'm afraid that the old man of the Reed family will be the first to reject her."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Lily heard this, her eyebrows gradually relaxed. "That's for the best. Otherwise, my sister would have died in vain. I knew I had let her off too easily when she was in prison!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean pursed his thin lips. "Let her off too easily?" The scene of her ten fingers bleeding and every bone in her fingers being broken flashed in his mind again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Back then, he had watched coldly from the side. One could even say that he had been an accomplice.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If one day Grace wanted Jason to seek justice for her, then he and the Stevens family would...</p></div>
