        <h1>Chapter 390</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The remark infuriated Tony Cummins. When he tried to question the landlord, the landlord had already hung up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Did something happen to the cinerary casket?" Melinda Riley asked her husband immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The landlord said that someone went there last night and took the cinerary casket!" said Tony Cummins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They took it? What about our 50 million dollars? Without the cinerary casket, that wench won&rsquo;t give us 50 million dollars!" Melinda Riley was worried now. Suddenly, she thought of another possibility. "Speaking of which, she must have had someone taken the cinerary casket away..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Frowning, Tony Cummins simply picked up his phone and dialed Grace's number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, Grace answered the phone. "Yes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I've thought about it. After all, we're father and daughter. No matter what, we're still related. If you really can't give me the 50 million dollars we agreed on yesterday all at once, you can give half of it first. I'll tell you where your mother is buried. You've hit it off with Jason, haven&rsquo;t you? The money shouldn't be a problem for him," said Tony Cummins. Although the cinerary casket was gone, he still wanted to try and blackmail her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was not his daughter who had taken the cinerary casket last night, then he could make do with 25 million dollars. He could just buy a cinerary casket and put false ashes in it to trick her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he did not see was Grace's disappointed face on the other end of the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was her father, and he was using her mother's ashes to get money from her. Was he really taking advantage of her mother's death?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. I got Mom's ashes yesterday, and I've already buried her," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins hurriedly snapped at that. "It was you! What right do you have to break into my rented house and take your mother's ashes? You even buried her? I'm your mother's husband. How can she be buried without my consent?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you&rsquo;re aware that you&rsquo;re her husband? I don't think my mother would have been willing to acknowledge you as her husband if she was still alive," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&hellip; Is this how you talk to your own father? You'd better tell me where you buried your mother right now, or I'll have a lawyer sue you. Even Jason can't help you. Don't think because you're with Jason now that he will take you seriously. He's just fooling around with you. Unlike Evelyn, she's Brian's official girlfriend..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Tony Cummins's words were cut short by another voice saying, "Oh? Why don't you try and see if I can help her or not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The icy baritone caused Tony Cummins to almost choke on his own spit and drop the phone he was holding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was that... Jason's voice?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was with his eldest daughter? Did he overhear their phone conversation?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Well..." Before Tony Cummins could finish his sentence, the call on the other end of the phone had been cut off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins could only stare at his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened?" Melinda Riley asked quickly. He had not put the call on speaker, so she did not hear what Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else? That girl is going places! She has Jason to protect her!" growled Tony Cummins. His eldest daughter had Jason as her backup, but he could not get anything out of it. That was what bothered him the most.</p></div>
