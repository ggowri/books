        <h1>Chapter 3485</h1>
        <div><p> </p><p>Veronica tightly held Jasper&#x27;s hand and managed to pull him up with great difficulty. Before the two could catch their breath, they heard footsteps approaching and the angry voices of the kidnappers.</p><p>&quot;The sound just now came from this direction. Those two girls must not have run far!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hurry and search! If they escape, we&#x27;ll be in trouble. We won&#x27;t just lose the money, but we&#x27;ll also end up in jail!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hurry, hurry up!&quot;</p><p>Jasper and Veronica exchanged a glance, knowing that their top priority at the moment was to make a clean escape. If they were caught by the kidnappers again, it was hard to say what fate awaited them.</p><p>Two girls are running in the mountains, while the kidnappers behind them are getting closer and closer.</p><p>Suddenly, one of the kidnappers said, &quot;I saw them, they ran this way. Hurry and catch up!&quot;</p><p>The kidnappers quickened their pace, while Veronica and Jasper were already panting and out of breath, lacking in physical strength.</p><p>At that moment, Veronica spotted a small hole hidden among the plants and trees. It was big enough for one person to hide in and very well concealed.</p><p>And so, the voices and footsteps of the kidnappers grew closer and closer. Veronica suddenly pushed Jasper into the small hole.</p><p>&quot;Jasper, listen to me. Stay hidden here and don&#x27;t come out. I&#x27;ll distract them and you should try to find help. If we both run together, we might not be able to escape in the end,&quot; said Veronica.</p><p>Jasper became anxious, &quot;This won&#x27;t work!&quot; Anyone would know that leading the kidnappers away is the most dangerous thing to do. Moreover, they were already low on energy, how could Veronica possibly outrun the kidnappers?</p><p>It was almost destined to be caught!</p><p>And if caught, the consequences... Jasper can hardly imagine.</p><p>&quot;It was originally my younger brother who caused this trouble. You are innocent and got involved by accident! Alright, don&#x27;t say anymore. Hurry up and hide!&quot; Veronica said, without waiting for Jasper to respond, she quickly ran in the opposite direction.</p><p>Jasper had tears in her eyes. She knew that what Veronica said was the most accurate. The two of them had to split up to have the best chance of survival.</p><p>If two people run together, there is a high chance that they will be caught together!</p><p>Jasper saw all the kidnappers chasing after Veronica, and after a moment, he crawled out of the small hole and ran desperately down the mountain. He wanted to find someone to save his sister Veronica!</p><p>Initially, she was unable to save Lawrence&#x27;s parents and caused Lawrence to go missing. It has always been her deepest regret and pain. Therefore, now, no matter what, she cannot let anything happen to Veronica.</p><p>Jasper didn&#x27;t know how long she had been running until she caught sight of a familiar figure - it was Mason!</p><p>Jasper&#x27;s tears suddenly burst out, and he almost crawled to Mason&#x27;s side, &quot;Mason, hurry... hurry and save Sister Veronica. Several kidnappers are chasing us. Sister Veronica went to lead them away so that I could escape!&quot;</p><p>Mason&#x27;s expression changed and he left with the words, &quot;Take care of yourself, the Reed family should be here soon!&quot; He then ran towards the direction Jasper pointed to.</p><p>The car belonging to the Reed family was involved in an accident and their GPS was damaged. It is likely that the Reed family will notice something is wrong, so they will come to the conclusion that Mason&#x27;s statement is not unfounded.</p></div>
