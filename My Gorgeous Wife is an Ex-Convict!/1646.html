        <h1>Chapter 1644</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before Jasper could answer, Mick Reed, who was nearby, suddenly pulled her behind him. He stared warily at Oriel Lynch, saying, "You and Aunty Lynch can go now that you've apologized."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch looked at Jasper unhappily. When she saw Mick protecting Jasper like that, she felt as though something that belonged to her had been taken away from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick was her brother alone before this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mick, I know I shouldn't have said that about your mom today. Will you forgive me?" Oriel Lynch said pitifully. She was being much more sincere than when she apologized to Jasper just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, Oriel Lynch did not want Mick Reed to hate her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed did not say anything, but his eyes that were looking at her were deadly cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, another pair of similar cold eyes also stared at Oriel Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oriel, who taught you to say that?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch was surprised and quickly said, "Mr. Reed... I... I wanted to apologize, so I just... did."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes turned colder. "Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, he ordered the nearby Uncle Kwan, "Take these three children to have some desserts."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," replied Uncle Kwan, knowing that Young master Reed was trying to send the three children away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, he walked up to the three kids and asked as he led them toward the dining room, "What would you like to eat? Little Young Lady, do you still want matcha cake today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm not eating matcha cake," Oriel Lynch immediately said. She hated matcha-flavored food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Uncle Kwan instantly stopped and said to Oriel Lynch, "Miss Lynch, I was referring to Jasper when I said &lsquo;Little Young Lady&rsquo;."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch's little face instantly reddened, and her body became extremely stiff. Uncle Kwan's words seemed to be reminding her of her status as an adopted daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She used to be called &lsquo;Little Young Lady&rsquo; here, but she was only Miss Lynch now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was all because of Jasper Reed. It was all because of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If only Jasper did not exist, then Mr. Reed and Mick would be hers. She would always be the little young lady of the family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Uncle Kwan left with the three children. Jason, Grace, and Irene Lynch were the only ones left in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch observed Jason's face, thinking of how to lead the conversation to get to the situation she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young master Reed, I'm so sorry that Oriel said that," said Irene Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oh? What did she say?" Jason asked lightly.</p></div>
