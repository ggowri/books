        <h1>Chapter 1168</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The front of the car had been deformed by the impact, and the door was dented. It looked like it was being opened from the inside with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A figure staggered out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes widened, and she stared at the figure in disbelief. It was... Brian. It really was Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she dared not believe it, what her eyes were seeing right now told her of the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She watched him stumble toward her, his face smeared with blood. He looked like a mess. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the crown prince of the entertainment industry. He was usually well-dressed and neat in front of others. When had he ever looked like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The red blood dripped on his cream-white jacket, making the sight of him look even more shocking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He reached her car door step by step, pulled it open, and bent over with some difficulty. His bloodstained face was tense. "Are you okay? Are you hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was so hoarse, and the hands he held out to her were full of blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's nose instantly turned sore. The man was asking her if she was hurt even though he was obviously badly hurt and bleeding!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You crashed into us on purpose, didn't you? Why?" She sobbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because you were in the car." It was the only answer he gave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if this answer already spoke for everything. She was in the car, so he would do anything to save her, even if it cost him his own life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just because... he loved her so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace, Lina, and Brian were taken to City First Hospital. Grace and Lina suffered relatively minor injuries. It was just some superficial injuries, nothing serious, but Brian was badly injured. The doctors rushed him to the operating room after a preliminary examination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace waited outside the operating room, and Lina waited with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching her best friend so worried, Lina comforted her by saying, "Don't worry, Brian is being operated on by City First's specialists. He'll be alright!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips tightly but could not relax.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina stopped speaking and just held her best friend's hand tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car accident today still frightened her when she recalled it. If it were not for Brian, she and Grace would probably be dead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Lina had no idea why Brian was there and saved them at such a close call, she had to admire Brian's courage and decisiveness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How many people would save others in such a way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had done it for Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Lina thought Brian's feelings for her best friend were only out of interest, then after what happened today, she knew that Brian probably loved Grace deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was impressed with how Brian, when he was covered in blood, had walked up to the passenger seat where Grace was and asked if she was hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even a bystander like me was touched. What about Grace? What does Grace think?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After half an hour, the Hart family arrived. It was Brian's parents. The hospital director and specialists also followed over.</p></div>
