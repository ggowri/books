        <h1>Chapter 4127</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Maybe." Tina said, because she couldn't think of any other reason why he would be looking at her like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But even if he recognized her, he didn't have to keep staring at her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The group's performance was magnificent and glamorous, with beautiful melodies filling the venue with each song!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the concert ended, Tina was still a little dazed. It was truly amazing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But as the concert neared its end, the sound of fans sobbing slowly became more and more noticeable, until it formed a chorus of crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Many fans knew that after this concert, the group would disband.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Therefore, crying became the fans' way of expressing their reluctance!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even Eugenia cried sadly, "Wuwuwu... After this, the brothers will go their separate ways... Why can't this group continue forever? We won't be able to see their performances together anymore! If I were the boss, I would definitely let this group continue!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina, on the other hand, wasn't that reluctant. Although she thought Kit was good in the group, going solo would give him more possibilities!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at it from a career development perspective, going solo would definitely have more advantages than disadvantages for Kit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the concert ended, fans started leaving the venue one by one. Eugenia and Tina also stood up from their seats, planning to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, as soon as they took a few steps, someone approached them and said, "Hello, I'm a staff member of the concert. Kit's father asked me to take you both to the backstage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as these words were spoken, both of them were immediately surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other person explained again, "Mr. Ingram instructed me to bring you both to the backstage, so that you can take a photo with the members of the group, it can also be considered as a commemoration!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This is simply an unexpected joy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Eugenia immediately became excited and grabbed Tina's hand, "Oh my god, am I dreaming? I can actually take a photo with the other members of the group today and get their autographs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're not dreaming!" Tina smiled and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was also quite surprised that Mr. Ingram would make such an arrangement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, although this arrangement was quite delightful, she inexplicably felt a vague unease, as if this arrangement was a bit too good to be true!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The person led them away from the crowd and headed towards the backstage area. Because there were security personnel guarding the backstage area, unrelated people were not allowed to enter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The staff member showed their work pass and led the two of them in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, when they were about to take the elevator, there happened to be someone transporting large props inside, occupying most of the space in the elevator. It would be difficult for all three of them to fit in the elevator. So the staff member said, "Let's do this, I'll take Eugenia up first, and you, Tina, can wait here for the next elevator and go straight to the 5th floor!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the way here, the three of them had already exchanged names.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright." Tina didn't have any objections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The person took Eugenia up first, while Tina waited for the next elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, a voice suddenly sounded, "Tina!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina turned her head and saw Kit walking towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What are you doing here?" they both said almost simultaneously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Then, they exchanged a glance. Tina said, "Your father arranged for a staff member to take me and Eugenia to the lounge area to meet the members of your group. He said we can take a photo and get autographs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Really? Seems like father really..." Kit's voice paused, and they didn't continue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing this, Tina quickly said, "If you think it's not appropriate, I can call Eugenia now and ask her to come down. She just went up to the 5th floor with the staff member, so she probably hasn't met the members of your group yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"There's nothing inappropriate, it's just taking a photo and getting autographs." Kit said, just as the next elevator arrived.</p></div>
