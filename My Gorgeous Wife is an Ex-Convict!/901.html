        <h1>Chapter 900</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"People like you probably don't feel that way, but I do. We're all human beings, but some people are superior to others and can easily control them. Some people are ordinary, so they have to be the inferior ones. They can&rsquo;t even take charge of their destiny and can only be fooled by others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If... I were not the daughter of an ordinary family but the daughter of a rich and powerful one, then I wouldn't have to be blamed for the car accident at all.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The people who framed me would never have dared to let me take the blame.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every day in prison, she lived like a soulless body. How she spent her day was at others' disposal. Others could decide freely whether she was going to be beaten that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All this depended on only one word from their superior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's dark eyes looked at the woman in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How do you know I don't feel that way?" he whispered, a wry smile creeping out of the corners of his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she know that the reason why I broke up with her and the reason why I want to stop loving her is that I don&rsquo;t want her to control my life and death?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Once I love her too much, it's no different from letting her take control of everything.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Doubt flashed in Grace's eyes when she heard Jason saying that. 'It's as if he knows what it was like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... he's the high and mighty Master Reed of Emerald City. Who could control his life and death?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must be joking, Mr. Reed," she said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I told you to call me Jason." He frowned a little. "You were calling me Jay when you held me last night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes widened as she looked at him in disbelief. All she had to do was to exclaim &lsquo;That's impossible!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't believe me? Why don't I call Terrence for you and you can ask him yourself? He heard it yesterday. Otherwise, you can also ask Hadwin," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked embarrassed. "I&hellip; was drunk yesterday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I spoke nonsense because I was drunk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In wine there is truth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace almost choked. 'In wine there is truth? What did I say when I got drunk yesterday?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if he had read her mind, he continued to gently rub her cold hands as he said, "You said you liked Asian men with black hair and that I have the most beautiful black hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You also said I was good and you liked me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You said you're my Sis and you would protect me." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more Jason spoke, the more Grace lowered her head. Her head was almost lowered to her chest. 'Gosh, why would I say that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't... Don't take me seriously!" Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I want to?" He took her hand to his lips and huffed out air as if it would warm her hands. "I don't take what other people say seriously, but I'll take what you say seriously."</p></div>
