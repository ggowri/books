        <h1>Chapter 3600</h1>
        <div><br><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After sending her back to her room, he returned to his own room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Entering the bathroom, he looked at the mirror on the sink, which reflected a sharply handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although many people say he looks like his father, he knows that there is also a shadow of the woman who gave birth to him in his appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily... the former superstar who ended up dying in prison!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her life was full of heinous crimes, yet it was also like a joke!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wished so much that he didn't look anything like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He thought that after all these years since her death, he could gradually get rid of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the two scavengers he met today seemed to be breaking this little hope of his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Those two old people were... Lily's parents! The people he should call grandparents!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A few years ago, he had investigated and knew that their lives were not easy. But at that time, he didn't go to see them because he didn't want to have anything to do with the Atkinson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He never expected that they would also come to Deer Capital, and that their lives would be even more miserable than what he knew from his investigation years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">So he unconsciously walked over and gave them the money he had on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And they... they knew him, knew that he was now the young master of the Barlow family, and knew that he was doing well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">They said that they came to Deer Capital not to disturb his life, but just to be closer to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But they didn't even know that he was now in college in Emerald City, not Deer Capital!</p></div>
