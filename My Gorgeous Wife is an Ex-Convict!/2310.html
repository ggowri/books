        <h1>Chapter 2308</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Nelson Corbyn finished his homework in the evening, Kyla said to her son, "I'm going to L City tomorrow. You're going to be home alone with Grandma for the next few days. You're a young man now. Be good and take care of Grandma. Wait for my return, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn blinked. "Mommy, are you going to look for Daddy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated a little. "I need to talk to your daddy about something. I should be back in a few days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, are you going to be with Daddy?" the childish voice asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze a little. Moments later, she said, "Things between Daddy and I will continue like they are now. Although we're not together, we love you and... I wish that your daddy will be safe and healthy no matter the relationship between us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn asked in confusion, "Mommy, are you not with Daddy because he was too mean to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla touched her son's head. "You'll understand when you grow up. Alright, it's late. Go to bed after washing up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn mumbled with a muddled mind, &ldquo;Do I have to wait until I grow up? But when will I be considered to have grown up?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not hate his father that much anymore, especially after he saved his mother and the sibling in his mother&rsquo;s belly. All his hatred toward him had faded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Daddy can protect Mommy forever, then... I don't have to hate Daddy!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After her son fell asleep, Kyla booked herself a high-speed train ticket to L City and packed her belongings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her high-speed train ride was at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow. There would be fewer passengers at that time too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the thought of seeing Martin Weiss again filled her with tension.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What should I say when I see him again? I was so harsh to him before, but now, I'm going to look for him to ask him for help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Will he agree to help me or reject me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How long has it been since I last felt this nervous?&rsquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart seemed to want to jump out of her throat just thinking about it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the high-speed train, Kyla looked out of the window at the scenery going backward. Her mood had slightly relaxed just a moment ago but she could not stop herself from tensing up again. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;ll be arriving in L City in a few hours, but what should I say when I see Martin Weiss?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What will Martin Weiss think of me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop thinking about it. I'll know when I get there,' she told herself. She would have to take this step eventually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sight of a pregnant woman riding on the train alone caught the attention of many. Someone would occasionally ask her why she was riding the train alone and where her family was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would smile and answer that her family was busy, so she took the train alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried to ignore the strange glances people gave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had faced so many strange glances over the years that sometimes, she could ignore them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The journey took five hours. It was already past 8:00 p.m. when she arrived in L City.</p></div>
