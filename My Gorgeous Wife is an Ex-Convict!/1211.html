        <h1>Chapter 1210</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, the car stopped and Jason got out. When he saw Grace, he stopped in his tracks as his eyes fell on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I have something to ask of you," she said dryly. She had not taken a sip of water since the night before, and now her mouth was terribly dry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're here for me?" The cold voice rang faintly, and there was a touch of sarcasm in it. "Is your memory too bad, or do you not take my words seriously? You deliberately show up in front of me today when I told you yesterday never to appear before me again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace leaped forward and grabbed Jason's arm tightly with both hands. "I know you don't want to see me again, but... I beg you, lend me two million dollars, okay? I'll pay you back. I'll pay you back with interest. I really need the money!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Two million?" He frowned slightly. Her so-called &lsquo;request&rsquo; surprised him, and the sarcasm in his eyes intensified. "What's the matter? Brian won't even give you two million dollars that you have to come here to beg from me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face turned pale immediately. She was already pale, but now it looked as if there was no color in her face at all. Her lips quivered, but for some time, she did not utter a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her calmly. "It seems I got it right. Brian won't give you two million dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lifted his hand and pulled hers away from his sleeve as he spoke, "But what makes you think I'm going to lend you two million dollars? Do you think you and I are close enough for you to borrow two million dollars from me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand was pulled away from his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, it was you who asked me to let you go and trampled my feelings for you to the ground. Yesterday, it was also you who said you didn't regret it! In that case, you need not ask me for anything now. It's my greatest mercy that you can still stand in front of me like this!" With that, he walked into the building as if he did not want to look at her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stood frozen to the spot, her face looking bitter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Mercy... Yeah, I rejected his feelings without leaving him any room. I embarrassed him, so to speak.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was indeed his mercy that she could stand here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... If I can't get two million dollars, what's going to happen to Lina? The money for Lina's surgery and the money for her stay in the ICU... Is Lina going to wake up without a home?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even... Even if they did sell the Sweeney family's house, will the money be enough for Lina's medical expenses?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt her heart sinking as she thought of it...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the president's office, Terrence looked at his boss' gloomy expression and his heart was full of fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that Grace would come to Master Reed again this morning?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not know what was going on in Master Reed's mind. If he had no feelings for Grace, he could have just ignored her instead of dragging her into the office yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Terrence could only say tentatively, "Master Reed, well... Miss Cummins is still standing outside the company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let her stand if she wants to stand," Jason said coldly.</p></div>
