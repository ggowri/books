        <h1>Chapter 3821</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the following days, Veronica and Mason were in the same ward. Veronica also </span><span>learned from the nurse that the first thing Mason did when he woke up was to look for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even in the condition of being injured all over, he struggled to get up from the bed, but was pressed down and told that she was lying in the bed next to him. He then calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the days in the ward, the two of them hardly communicated because they were both lying in bed and Veronica was burdened with heavy thoughts, while Mason was a silent person.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Veronica was fortunate that Mason did not kick her out of the ward, so she was able to continue staying in Mason's ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Reed family came to visit every day, and because the two were in the same ward, it saved the Reed family from running around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica also learned from the Reed family how close they were to being doomed if they had been a little later or if there had been any mistakes in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about Daniel? How is he?" Veronica asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she asked the question, she clearly felt Mason looking at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He has been arrested by the police. He made the explosive device himself, which caused the explosives buried at the scene to detonate. He will be punished for all his crimes. Even if he is not sentenced to death, he will be imprisoned for life," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, all of this was what she heard from her mother.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never expected that this would be his fate in the end," Veronica sighed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she had once seen Daniel in his prime.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, Daniel was also a sunny boy who gave people a warm feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, Daniel is cold, extreme, and likes to push all the blame onto others, in order to believe that he has done nothing wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Step by step, he went astray like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the end, he put himself in an irretrievable situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, you wouldn't sympathize with him, would you?" Jasper asked, knowing that Daniel was Veronica's ex-boyfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Veronica replied, "I won't sympathize with him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, she almost lost her life because of Daniel. Since Daniel clearly wanted her dead, why should she sympathize with such a person?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a nurse walked in and took Mason for some tests.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, in the hospital room, there were only Jasper, Veronica, and the nurse who was taking care of Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason teased Veronica, "Veronica, I have to say, Mason really cares about you. He was willing to risk his life for you. Are you really going to break up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not that we're going to break up, we've already broken up!" Veronica corrected him silently in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper continued, "Veronica, Mason definitely cares about you. Even though we don't know what he's thinking and why he wanted to break up with you, I'm sure it's not </span><span>because he doesn't love you! If he really had no feelings for you, he would have just stood outside and not come in when the explosion happened!"</span></p></div>
