        <h1>Chapter 3511</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica instinctively opened her mouth, wanting to say something, but no words came out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Mason had already turned around and left on his own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer and Rosalind, who were originally stunned, immediately came back to their senses and hurriedly followed him out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as they chased downstairs, Mason had already gotten into the car and sped away, leaving them in the dust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The couple looked at each other in fear and confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What Mason said just now was like a...breakup! If Mason really breaks ties with Veronica, then the Barlow family will be in big trouble!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the Barlow family owes its success to Mason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not to mention, their own son is still involved in a kidnapping case! Without the help of the Reed family, would their son be able to clear his name?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The couple immediately returned home and said to Veronica, "Veronica, how could you speak to Mason like that just now! You need to go back to the Reed family and apologize to Mason!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do I have to apologize even if he was involved in planning the kidnapping with Lionel?" Veronica retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course!" Archer said fiercely, "Even if he did participate in planning the kidnapping, so what? You're fine, aren't you? You better not fall out with him, or I won't spare you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rosalind also said anxiously, "Veronica, you don't want to see this family fall apart, do you? And Lionel, he's only been released on bail, the case hasn't been decided yet! If the Reed family doesn't help us when the time comes, what if Lionel is really sentenced? What are we going to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They all insisted that Veronica should apologize to Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at her father and stepmother, Veronica felt an overwhelming sense of exhaustion and absurdity!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Are these really her family? They don't seem to care about the harm she has suffered, but only about maintaining their relationship with the Reed family and Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Lionel, who had been nervously hiding in the corner, suddenly rushed over and grabbed Veronica, pleading, "Sis, you have to save me! You have to make Mason save me, I don't want to go to jail!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt as if she was being crushed by a heavy mountain, making it hard for her to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Jasper saw Mason return alone to the Reed family, he asked in confusion, "Mason, why did you come back alone? Where's Veronica?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, these days, Mason and Veronica have been inseparable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when Mason heard her words, he lifted his head and looked at her with a mixed expression of crying and smiling. "Do you believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course I do," Jasper said naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's eyelashes trembled slightly. "Do you believe me no matter what I say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Jasper nodded without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because you're my Mason!" she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was that simple, just because he was her Mason! Mason lowered his eyes gently, but... he thought the person who trusted him the most in this world didn't believe him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even all the good he did was only because he was the Reed family's Mason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he didn't have this status in the Reed family, how would she treat him?</p></div>
