        <h1>Chapter 3914</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing her mother's submissive appearance, Nancy felt even more pain in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since her mother married into the Schultz family, although they were financially secure, this security was obtained through repeated mental humiliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, she would rather live a poor life with her mother, at least they were happy back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, promise Mom that you won't have anything to do with that young master of the Reed family anymore, okay! That's the man Clarissa likes. If you want to fight for him, have you ever thought about how sad and upset Clarissa would be? Have you ever thought about the impact on the Schultz family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, I haven't!" Nancy said, "I don't know what Clarissa has told you, but I really don't have anything with that young master of the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then swear to Mom that you won't fight with Clarissa for any man or anything else. Without the Schultz family, we would still be living in a broken little house after all these years. How could we have such a good life now?" Eileen said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy smiled bitterly. A good life... was it really a good life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She understood that her mother might have been scared of poverty before, so... she thought it was a good life, but it really wasn't for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, if one day, I really fall in love with a man, but Clarissa also likes him, do you want me to give up?" Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course!" Eileen said without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's smile became more bitter. "Why, why do you want me to keep giving in? From childhood to now, no matter how Clarissa hits me, scolds me, humiliates me, I always give in because you said that the Schultz family is raising me, and Clarissa is the true lady of the Schultz family, so I should give in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a deep breath and looked firmly at her mother. "But... just because I keep giving in doesn't mean I have no bottom line. Mom, I am also a person with emotions and thoughts. I am not an object, let alone a slave of the Schultz family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What nonsense are you talking about? Don't you have any sense of gratitude?" Eileen said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then how long do I have to show my gratitude? Do I have to give my life to the Schultz family?" Nancy said sadly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A hint of heartache flashed across Eileen's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew her daughter's pain all too well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, her husband loved Clarissa the most, his biological daughter. Although Clarissa was the nominal lady of the Schultz family, she had always relied on her husband financially.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every month, she only received some pocket money from her husband.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she left the Schultz family, what kind of job could she do at her age after years of living a comfortable life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for her daughter, she was only working in a hotel and not earning much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, she just hoped to endure and let herself and her daughter live a slightly better life in the Schultz family. What's wrong with that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as the mother and daughter were facing each other, suddenly another voice echoed in the hall of the Schultz family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who do I see coming back? It's my sister!" Clarissa said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy took a deep breath and turned to Clarissa. "I just came to see my mom and I'm leaving soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, Nancy was ready to leave.</p></div>
