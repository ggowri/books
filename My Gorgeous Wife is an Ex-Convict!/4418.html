        <h1>Chapter 4416: Only Love Her</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, tears welled up in his eyes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley watched the tears on Calvert's face, glistening like pearls, falling one by one. They were so beautiful, they took her breath away and tugged at her heartstrings.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This wasn't the first time she had seen him cry.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, he had cried in front of her, and she had also seen the character he played cry in movies and TV shows.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it seems like her emotions are much more intense now than before.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why is that?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe... it's because her feelings for him are growing stronger, so he's becoming more and more capable of affecting her emotions.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't cry," she murmured, her lips brushing against his cheek. By the time she realized what she was doing, she was already kissing away his tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was taken aback, seemingly never having imagined that one day, she would actually do something like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, when she watched movies and TV shows, she always wondered why people kissed away each other's tears.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, I've come to realize there's something called irresistible feelings!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears, when they enter the mouth, have a salty taste.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Calvert, whose tears she was kissing, was completely stiff, daring not to move an inch. His cheeks flushed red, and the tears that had been continuously falling suddenly stopped due to his sheer astonishment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley actually felt a bit regretful about this; she hadn't had her fill yet!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, I believe you. So, do you believe what I just said?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert looked at Harley with reddened eyes, truly embodying a "pitiful" look. "I... believe," Calvert said, his voice soft yet firm.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley laughed, "Calvert, you know, when I like someone, I really like them. I start thinking about our future together, imagining all sorts of scenarios, but..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She paused, her face taking on a serious expression. "If one day I find out you don't love me anymore, I'll end this relationship and never look back. I don't like on-and-off relationships; they make me anxious. Can you accept that?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert stared at her blankly. So, was she telling him that there was no longer any chance between her and Lornell?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also making it crystal clear to him that between them, there was only one chance as well!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... just one chance was all he needed!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he couldn't imagine what it would be like not to love her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Loving her was like an instinct for him, as natural as needing to eat, drink, or breathe!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, I accept!" he said. "Harley, you're the only one I'll ever love in my life!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, there will never be an end, unless... she doesn't want him anymore!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley laughed, wrapped his arms around Calvert's neck, and took the initiative to press his lips against the other's.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought, this time, she had truly found someone she could love for a lifetime!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the days that followed, life was pretty uneventful. Even though Calvert still felt inferior around Harley, thinking he wasn't good enough for her, Harley always seemed to read his mind effortlessly. She constantly soothed his emotions, reassuring him of how much she loved him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert himself felt quite conflicted. On one hand, he thought it was already quite special that someone like him could be her friend. He believed he shouldn't be by her side as her boyfriend, potentially subjecting her to criticism. Yet on the other hand, he couldn't convince himself to let go.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because... he loved her too much, so much that he didn't know what he'd do if he ever lost her!</span></p></div>
