        <h1>Chapter 2031</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"All of a sudden?" He glanced at her already bulging belly. Speaking of &lsquo;all of a sudden&rsquo;, it was because she had gotten pregnant. They were considered late to only be getting married now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina also could not help smiling as she thought of this. She asked, "What made you suddenly think of marriage..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Halfway through her sentence, she seemed to recall something and said, "Did Grace tell you about what happened when I went to the washroom today? You don't have to worry about it. Those two women were only blabbing about me when they said I&rsquo;m a baby-making machine and you don&rsquo;t even like me. I didn't take what they said to heart. You don't have to marry me in a hurry just for that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson froze. "What's the matter? Did someone say that about you today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Huh? You didn&rsquo;t know about it?" Lina froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's face was cold. Although Grace had told him someone was gossiping about Lina behind her back, he did not expect them to be so mean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the woman before him still smiled nonchalantly as she consoled him by telling him that she did not care about it at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson suddenly bent over and hugged Lina. "I want to marry you. I've been looking forward to it the most. It's just that many things have happened after we made up, so the matter of marriage kept getting delayed. I was careless. I thought it was just going to be delayed for a few days and forgot what you would have to face."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Those gossips don't scare me!" Lina raised her hands as she hugged Hadwin Stephenson back. After experiencing so many things, what others said <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>meant nothing to her. As long as he was with her and he loved her, she did not care about the rest!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson muttered, "But I'm scared! I'm afraid those gossips will hurt you, your family, and even our children. I was supposed to give you a big wedding after I took care of things. But we can only register and get a marriage license first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then... why don't you go to my house tonight and we'll tell my parents about it?" said Lina. After all, getting a marriage license was a big deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina hesitated for a moment before saying, "Do you... want to tell your mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes darkened. "No, we don't have to tell her about us getting a marriage license."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson left the company with Lina. Hadwin Stephenson asked, "Does your family have any rules about a wedding proposal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Rules?" Lina thought about it. "I&rsquo;ve never heard my parents talk about any rules."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What about other requirements?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Requirements?" She froze a little. "Do you mean those three gold items and bride price? I don't like wearing gold anyway, so I don't care even if I don't have three gold pieces. The bride price in Emerald City is usually 50,000 to 100,000 dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">50,000 to 100,000 dollars was nothing to Hadwin Stephenson. Therefore, Lina was not worried about it. Besides, she knew her parents only wanted her to marry well and would not ask her husband for anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "Really? Okay, I see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, they did not drive to the Sweeney family's apartment block but to a large shopping mall in tMason Swansonty. Half an hour later, Lina looked at the things Hadwin Stephenson carried in his hand. "Uh... Do you need to buy so many things?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, these things were worth a lot of money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The bottle of wine that he wanted to give her father cost over 100,000 dollars. She felt her body shake when he swiped his card.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'A bottle of wine that costs more than 100,000 dollars. I wonder if Dad&rsquo;s heart will ache when he finds out about the price?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Apart from that, the jewelry he bought her mother... was even more expensive. Lina thought it was better not to tell her mother the price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"My parents will lose their minds when they see all these," Lina could not help saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm proposing today, and time is tight. I can only buy a few things now and make up for it later.&rdquo;</p></div>
