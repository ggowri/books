        <h1>Chapter 1541</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper said out loud, "I'll also be a good sister. I'll protect my brother as well!" This meant that she had accepted being the younger sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed's tiny body could not help trembling. 'My sister is... going to protect me too?' This was the first time he promised to protect someone and also the first time anyone had said they would protect him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is this what it's like to have a sister? It's so different from Wanna being my sister.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Uncle Kwan informed them that dinner was ready. Grace looked up at the second floor. "Is Jay not coming down for dinner?" Dr. Guzman had left 15 minutes ago after telling them that Jason was okay. He only had a headache earlier because his memories were triggered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The maid asked him earlier. Young master Reed said he has no appetite and will eat later. He asked Young Madam to have dinner with Little Young Master and Little Young Lady first," said Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it because of the headache he just had?' Grace thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was still no sign of Jason after she finished dinner with the two children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, Grace took some food and got ready to send it upstairs to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as she was about to go upstairs, a small hand suddenly tugged at the hem of her clothes. Grace turned her head to look straight into her son's peach blossom eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you... going to leave Daddy and me again?" the little one asked with a solemn expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I won't leave you and Daddy." Grace smiled gently. She would be with Jay and their children in Reed Residence! "Mick, call me &lsquo;Mommy&rsquo;. I want to hear you call me that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one's face, which was still solemn, instantly became a little awkward. Under Grace's gaze, his little face reddened slightly. It took a while before the word &lsquo;Mommy&rsquo; was finally squeezed out of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It might have sounded somewhat reluctant, but it was great motivation for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, she had missed out five years with her son. Now that she was back, she would have plenty of time to bond with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I won't leave you and Daddy too!" Jasper said to Mick Reed as she chimed in. Her two little hands even grabbed him as she kissed him on the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help but laugh as she looked at them. Her daughter would kiss people she liked. It seemed that her daughter was very fond of her new brother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, play with each other while I take dinner to Daddy," Grace said as she headed for the second floor with the dinner tray.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she arrived at the room Jason was in, she found him sitting on the couch with his eyes closed. He had his chin propped on one hand. He seemed to be asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could not help but tread softly as she walked over to him, placing the dinner tray on the coffee table before the couch. She then leaned over to take a closer look at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he was asleep, he looked just like an angel in a painting. He even made people think that he was &lsquo;pure&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if he could banish all the darkness in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How long have I not watched him sleep?' Grace thought to herself. In her memories, she used to watch him sleep all the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Every time she saw his sleeping face, she would marvel at his eyelashes which were so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His lashes were still long and dark, covering his eyelids like fans.</p></div>
