        <h1>Chapter 2675</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not make the final decision, so all she could do was take a stand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack's eyes sparkled, and she immediately said, "It seems you insist on having the second female lead beaten up in the bushes. Okay, I won't change the script and will follow the original scene as long as you're the stand-in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze. "You want me to be the stand-in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, what do you think? Since you like the plot so much that you won't change it, you can be the stand-in. We're about the same size, so you can probably do a good job as a stand-in." Queenie Mack smiled maliciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not a professional actor. You can always find other stand-ins of your size." Valda Theller refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I want you to do it!" Queenie Mack said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Others could now tell that Queenie Mack was picking on Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scriptwriter in charge got along well with Valda Theller. They advised Queenie Mack, "Why give the comic artist a hard time? She's not a professional actor. She'll get hurt if you let her become a stand-in for such a scene. It might not turn out well either. It'll be troublesome if we have to find another stand-in to shoot it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could it not turn out well?" Queenie Mack smiled. "It was revealed earlier that Comic Artist Zhong was a bully in university. Later on, she was bullied by others. I suppose such a scene is a piece of cake to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she said this, Valda Theller's expression changed immediately. The way the people around them looked at Valda Theller changed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Valda Theller's viral post was removed and the comments were deleted, many people in the film crew knew about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had never explained anything to anyone either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked up at her. "If whatever is exposed online is true, are the online expos&eacute;s about you also true?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Queenie Mack glared at Valda Theller. The online expos&eacute;s about her were about plastic surgery and her being a homewrecker. She had good resources, so many people wondered who her backer was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only a few people know who her backer was. It was not time to tell them who it was, so she kept her mouth shut and never told anyone who was her backer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ever since meeting that backer and climbing up the social ladder, she had a different mindset. If important people in the film crew such as the director and the producer criticized her, she would just accept it. However, she could not accept an ordinary comic artist like Valda Theller treating her like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, how dare you? Just wait and see!" With that said, Queenie Mack turned around and walked away in her high heels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nearby, the male lead Gloria was watching this scene with a playful smile on his lips. The assistant standing beside him said, "I'm afraid Valda Theller is in trouble. Queenie Mack isn't easy to mess with. I heard she's backed by the Weiss family of Emerald City."</p></div>
