        <h1>Chapter 3804</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalind chimed in, "Yes, just show him some affection. If that doesn't work, you can even let him stay overnight. What can't be resolved between a man and a woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica frowned at her stepmother's explicit suggestion, and her father, unfortunately, seemed to agree.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, are you planning to sell me off for your own benefit? Too bad, I'm not planning on selling myself. And as for you, don't even think about leeching off me to suck the Reed family's blood!" Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You--" Archer became angry and raised his hand to hit Veronica's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Veronica intercepted his hand in mid-air. "Don't think I'll just let you hit me. If you cause me any harm, I'll call the police and see who will be embarrassed in the end!" Veronica said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer was so angry that he trembled all over, but he reluctantly withdrew his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, he didn't want to go to the police station. Once he did, those clients who mistakenly thought his daughter was still dating Mason would find out the truth, and he wouldn't be able to do business anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For now, he could only sign the business contracts while others still didn't know that his daughter and Mason had broken up. As for the rest, he could only deal with it later!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer and Rosalind left in a huff. After Veronica closed the door, she slumped against it like a deflated balloon.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she didn't feel the coldness of her biological father, only endless bitterness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always known that her father had no real affection for her, and her stepmother was even worse. Even her half-brother, who was the same father but different mother, only treated her slightly better, but that was all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she moved out, that half-brother never came to see her, let alone care about her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, although she felt bitter, she didn't feel any pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, facing everything, she only feels her heart constantly throbbing in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it because of breaking up with Mason? Not only did she lose her family, but also the love she had finally gained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, you really...have no one who loves you," she murmured to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps being with Mason was just a dream, a short-lived dream, a fantasy of someone truly loving her and being with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But dreams are just dreams, and there will always be a day to wake up!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the following days, everything seemed calm and quiet. Fewer and fewer people in school paid attention to her, and those who came to see her on purpose also decreased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the company's leaders found out that she failed to persuade Daniel, they didn't ask her to go find him again. She continued to go to class and work every day, as if everything had returned to before she dated Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only she knew that she couldn't go back! Her state of mind couldn't go back to the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's like a heart that has lost its vitality. Now it's just alive, just existing, and she doesn't even know what she's hoping for.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Auntie Grace had come to see her once and asked her what she was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she just smiled faintly, "Maybe Mason and I are really not that suitable. People like us may only be suitable as siblings, not as lovers."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, they can't even be siblings.</span></p></div>
