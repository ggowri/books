        <h1>Chapter 3827</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as she finished speaking, she was met with a deadly glare from Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper immediately shrunk her neck. Okay, it seems like she said the wrong thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not early," Mason said, "getting married right after college graduation is just right, unless you don't want to marry me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica stared at Mason in a daze. They just reconciled yesterday and started dating again, and now they're discussing getting married after graduation. Isn't this moving too fast?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was having trouble keeping up with this pace!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want to marry me after we graduate?" Mason asked with a serious expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Veronica had a feeling that if she gave a negative answer, she would once again close Mason's heart that she had just opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marriage...she had never really thought about this question."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But...it seemed natural to her that she would always be with him in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, thinking about it, it was natural for her to marry him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As for the age at which they would get married, it didn't matter. Whether it was early or late, he would be the only person she would marry in her lifetime."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do." Veronica met Mason's gaze and replied, "But when we graduate from college, you...probably won't have reached the legal age for marriage yet. So, let's get married when you reach that age!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's expression softened at her words. "Okay, when that time comes, we'll get married."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper watched the scene in front of her in shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Okay, she had just said it casually, but...Mason and Veronica had actually made a direct engagement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Wasn't this too explosive?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If their families found out, who knows how shocked they would be!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after Jasper told her family about it, she didn't get the shocked reaction she expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or to be more specific, her mother was pleased and showed a surprised expression. "Really? They said they'll get married when Mason reaches the legal age? That's great! These two kids are finally together, and my heart can finally rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As for her father and older brother, their reactions were almost the same, with two similar faces showing...no surprise at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she had just commented on the weather today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, big brother, why aren't you surprised at all?" Jasper couldn't help but ask in the end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Things that have been thought of for a long time are not surprising," Mick lazily said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've thought of it for a long time?" Jasper clearly didn't believe him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When have you ever seen Mason risk his life to save someone? Veronica should know that she can't miss Mason as long as she's not completely indifferent to him. Otherwise, the next time, no one will risk their life to save her like this again," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper frowned. It was obviously a very romantic thing, but when his older brother said it, it didn't feel romantic at all. Instead, it seemed like Veronica married Mason for some purpose.</span></p></div>
