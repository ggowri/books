        <h1>Chapter 685</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lowered his head, his eyes falling on her. She was leaning on his shoulder. 'If she knows the truth, would she still think... It&rsquo;s great to have met me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Probably not.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace was sound asleep, Jason gently moved and gingerly picked up Grace. He went back to the bedroom and put her down on the soft bed. Then, he gently stroked her hair with his fingers. "Grace, everything ends here, all right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The truth of her case ended here, and so did her past with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Let's not pursue either of these matters any further!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's for the best!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A reporter spread the news of Grace's case reversal on the internet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, there was a great deal of discussion about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Grace was just a promising rookie lawyer who had been cleared of a wrongful conviction. It was Grace's ex-boyfriend, Sean, and Lily, a celebrity, who were the topic of discussion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the reporter who broke the story said that he had interviewed Lily before this, Lily did not seem to know about the case in advance. After she did, she did not say anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As a result, more people went to Lily's social media accounts to ask what she thought of Grace's case reversal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Others showed screenshots of Lily publicly saying that she would not forgive Grace, calling her low and disgusting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily did issue a public statement saying that she had just learned that Grace was wronged. She only said those things because the law made a wrongful conviction and also that she was now willing to publicly apologize to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Lily released a video of herself publicly apologizing. The video was simple. It was just Lily saying to the camera, "Grace, I apologize for what I&rsquo;ve said to you." There was nothing else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many found Lily's apology too simple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some even claimed that since Grace was wronged, Lily had stolen her boyfriend and cursed her for being inhumane. She was worse than the Wicked Witch of the West.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Lily's fans found their idol straightforward and upright. If they wanted to blame someone, they should blame the one who made the wrong judgment as well as the false witnesses and Dexter Rios.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In short, there were all kinds of interesting comments on the internet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Others took to Sean's social media account to ask if Sean would make a different choice since Grace was wronged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean only responded publicly, "The past is in the past, and I just want to cherish the present."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina did not know that her best friend's case was reversed until she read the news. She called her best friend in a hurry and said, "Why didn't you tell me about such a big issue?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't we supposed to meet tomorrow? That's what I wanted to talk to you about!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you say so in advance? If it hadn't been for the news, I wouldn't have known!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just afraid if I told you in advance and failed, I'd spoil your happiness for me," said Grace. Lina had done so much for her that she did not want to cause Lina any more problems.</p></div>
