        <h1>Chapter 1248</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From last night to this morning, she had repeatedly expressed to him that she did not want a pregnancy reduction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If anything happened to her, then he...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes were deep. "Have you thought it through?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've made up my mind," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You won't regret whatever the final result is?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She replied, "Yes, I won't!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together. Moments later, he looked at the panel of doctors. "If we don't get the pregnancy reduction and insist on keeping the babies, what&rsquo;s the chance of the mother and babies being safe?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"50%," the panel answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his lips tighter. 'Not... even a 60% passing score.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never wanted to do anything he was not sure of, but now... "Then keep the babies first. If something dangerous comes up while we try to keep them safe, then... save the mother first no matter what!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Grace wanted to say more but was interrupted by Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, this is my bottom line. If you're not even willing to agree to this, then I would rather you hate me forever!" he said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace understood what he meant. In other words, if she disagreed, he would probably do anything to tie her to the operating table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it." She finally gave in. After all, what mattered most was to get him to keep the babies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Next, the panel talked to Grace and Jason about the plan to save the babies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace listened carefully and asked questions from time to time while Jason kept his eyes on Grace most of the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they finished talking to the panel, the doctors left the conference room one after another. Grace turned her head to find Jason looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way those beautiful peach blossom eyes looked at her was not cold, but also not gentle and charming. There was... endless depth as if he was deeply imprinting her into his eyes and his heart. It was like she was the only person in the world whom he cared about...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What am I thinking?' Grace scolded herself in her heart that she was overthinking. 'How could his feelings for me ever be the same?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you looking at?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing." He smiled faintly and looked away. "Come on, aren't you going to the hospital to see Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," responded Grace. She got up and headed to the door of the conference room, only to find after a few steps that he was not following her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned to look at him but found him standing a few feet away from her, looking at her with the same deep gaze as before. Suddenly, a seemingly self-mocking smile slowly appeared on his lips. He lifted his steps and approached her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a split second, Grace felt as if her heart had been hit hard by something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Until the car arrived at the hospital&rsquo;s entrance, the way Jason looked at her and the way he smiled kept recurring to her. She somehow had an aching feeling in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was already a staff member waiting for them at the hospital. Jason said, "The staff will take you to Lina's ward. I'm not going upstairs with you. Call the driver when you're done, and the driver will come and pick you up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," answered Grace as she followed the staff to her best friend's ward.</p></div>
