        <h1>Chapter 4121</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Chandler, what are you doing here?" Tina asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I came to find you, but you're with him..." Chandler's gaze passed Tina and looked at Kit getting out of the nanny car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, I went to the film and television city today and happened to meet Kit, so he gave me a ride back." Tina explained briefly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, Mr. Hunter. Nice to see you again." Kit took the initiative to step forward and shook hands with Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler looked at Kit, then shook hands with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thanks to Kit for taking my fianc&eacute;e home!" There was a sense of asserting dominance in his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need to thank me. Tina is my fan, and I'm happy to have such fans. Plus, Tina and I get along well!" Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina felt inexplicably uneasy on the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she was happy that Kit praised her, the atmosphere gave her a strange feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, the atmosphere didn't last long, and Kit left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina turned to Chandler and said, "Chandler, how come you're here? Come on in and have a seat!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler pursed his lips and followed Tina into the Stephenson family's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin and Lina were not in the house. They entered the living room and Tina said, "Let me make you a cup of tea." She was about to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler stopped Tina suddenly and said, "Are you trying to avoid me again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Huh?" She paused and turned to look at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Did I say something wrong? These past few days, you've been deliberately avoiding me, haven't you?" Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was speechless. Well, he was right. She had been avoiding him a bit, but... "That's because I haven't figured out what to say to you yet!" she glared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Is there something you can't say to me if you see me?" Chandler asked in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm afraid I'll say something that will make you angry!" Tina puffed out her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What would make me angry?" he was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If anyone was going to be angry, it should be him! When he saw her get out of Kit's car earlier, he felt a surge of anger in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He knew she was just a fan with a crush on an idol, and she had the freedom to make friends with whoever she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had the right to choose who she wanted to meet and who she wanted to take her home!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But why did he feel so uneasy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was like he was afraid that her feelings for him would waver!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You always act like an adult and treat me like a child! You keep saying that you like and love me, but you always leave the choice to me and act like it's okay even if I abandon you! If you really love me, how can you act like it's okay to be abandoned? Or do you not love me at all?" Tina said directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She expressed all her feelings and discomforts towards him clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler was shocked. He never thought she would feel this way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I just don't want to hold you back," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "If I don't love you, you can't hold me back at all! My father has told me that even if the Stephenson family has to sacrifice everything and I become a dishonest person, he won't let me marry you if I really don't want to!" Tina said angrily. "So don't always make me choose whether or not to be with you, and don't say such things again! If you really love me, you should tell me that you won't let me go even if I want to leave you!"</p></div>
