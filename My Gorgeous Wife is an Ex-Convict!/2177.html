        <h1>Chapter 2175</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She's probably just sad that her friend left. She must have calmed down by now and will probably sleep in her own room again in a few days," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I suppose so?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">While they were talking, a maid suddenly screamed on the stairway of the second floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked up and shouted, "What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The maid said, "Something made a small hole in the wall behind this vase."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina and Grace looked at each other. They quickly walked up the stairs to where the small hole was. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was a hole that looked like it had been shot by something. There was a large vase with a plant here, so it had covered the hole. Therefore, they only saw it now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace crouched down and looked at the plant. Sure enough, one of the leaves had a hole. It was the same size as the hole in the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina asked, "What's going on? Why is there a hole? Who&rsquo;s in charge of cleaning this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The maid quickly said, "I am, but I usually just wipe the vase. I would only move it every two weeks to sweep the dust near the wall. This hole... wasn&rsquo;t... here before this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at the hole, her face full of suspicion. Moments later, she said to Lina, "Lina, call the police. I think the police need to come over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Huh? The police?" Lina was startled but called the police like what her best friend said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The police arrived and removed the air gun bullet lodged in the wall. It would not kill but would definitely injure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">One could even be crippled for life if hit in certain spots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina shivered and turned pale. "Why is there such a bullet here? Who did it? If someone had walked by and gotten shot, wouldn&rsquo;t they..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At this point, Lina suddenly looked at Grace as if she thought of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace seemed to have recalled something as well. She looked at Lina. "Is it possible that William pushed Nelson because of the sound the air gun made?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's possible. Maybe Nelson didn't hear it but William did," Lina speculated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Taking a deep breath, Grace said to the police, "I hope the police can conduct an investigation to find out the time and date this incident took place. Maybe it can help catch the culprit.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If the investigation turned out as she thought it would, then all of them... had misunderstood William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William had saved Nelson instead of harming him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Thinking of the injustice and grievances William had suffered, Grace felt a pang of pain in her heart.</p></div>
