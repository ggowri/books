        <h1>Chapter 3818</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had to save Mason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if her shoulder was broken, even if both her hands were useless, even if it meant sacrificing her own life, she wanted to save him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was still shouting, but she couldn't hear him clearly anymore, she could only see his mouth opening and closing, his expression so anxious!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, don't worry, I'll protect you! No matter what happens, I'll protect you..." She murmured, as if unconsciously saying these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And before her eyes, a scene from a long time ago appeared, when she went to his home, his small body covered in wounds, although it should have been very painful, his face was numb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that she is indifferent to everything, even when facing an unfamiliar environment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No anxiety, no fear, and no curiosity!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a child... even younger than her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When their eyes met, she suddenly felt a protective instinct towards him, perhaps because they were both lonely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person who brought him said he was an orphan with no parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had a father, a half-brother, and a stepmother who didn't care about her in this family, she always felt like an orphan herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, she took his hand, and he didn't resist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And so, day after day, year after year, he became the most important person in her heart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If... she had realized her true feelings for him earlier, and understood that she actually loved him, then she wouldn't have chosen to date Daniel, and so many bad things wouldn't have happened afterwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had too many "if onlys" and wanted to change things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, her fate has become like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just a little higher, just lift this rock a little higher..." She gasped for breath and continued to use every bit of strength in her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His mouth was still moving, desperately trying to say something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she couldn't hear anything, she couldn't hear anything at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did the explosion damage her eardrums? Or was it because she was too tired and in too much pain that even her hearing was affected?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it didn't matter. All she wanted was for him to survive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"...you must stay alive..." Her lips moved, her vision becoming increasingly blurry. She could hardly see his face anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just hold on a little longer, just a little longer!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, she seemed to hear the sound of an explosion again. His figure in front of her seemed to be gradually shrouded in darkness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she...in the end, fail to save him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He...was ultimately burdened by her, wasn't he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry...and, I...love you..." With her last bit of consciousness, she said these words. Immediately after, her whole body finally fell into darkness...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All her senses seemed to be sealed off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to sleep, to just keep sinking into slumber...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p></div>
