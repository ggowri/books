        <h1>Chapter 1740</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She rushed in the direction of the sound, and Terrence followed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The roars kept sounding out at intervals. It sounded as though Jason was desperately trying to hold himself back but it was just too painful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace and Terrence rushed to the room where the voice came from, they heard the voice of a middle-aged man that rang alongside the roars. "Mr. Reed, please calm down. Calm down. Everything you see has already happened..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace rushed into the room, she saw Jason lying on a white recliner with Dr. Joseph beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was still in a hypnotic state. His eyes were closed, but something was wrong. His hands seemed to be desperately trying to grasp something. He looked like he wanted to get up, and he was biting on his lower lip till the flesh had split. A stream of red blood trickled down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, what's going on?" Grace asked in a panic. As he had learned about hypnosis due to her own memory loss, she knew that regular hypnosis sessions would not cause this sort of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Terrence, what are you doing here?" asked Dr. Joseph.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What on earth is going on with Jay? Stop the hypnosis and wake him up!" Grace said with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Joseph said, "We can only wait for Mr. Reed to calm down. If we stop the hypnosis halfway, it&rsquo;ll only do more damage to his mental health! Who on earth hypnotized Mr. Reed? His amnesia was caused by hypnosis, and the person who hypnotized him&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Jason, who was on the recliner, suddenly roared. "No!" He tore off all the cables that were attached to him and the recliner flipped over because of his motion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason fell to the floor, and Grace rushed over to help him. However, he pushed her away, and her body hit the cabinet nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Ouch!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace felt some pain in her waist. Terrence and Dr. Joseph were knocked to the floor by Jason as well. Jason was strangling Dr. Joseph with his fingers, making him almost out of breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why... Why..." Jason's eyes were still closed, and he seemed to have fallen into a mad state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Joseph struggled desperately, but it seemed useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence tried to get up to stop him but it was to no avail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Swallowing the pain, Grace rushed forward and said, "Jay, wake up, wake up! Stop strangling him. You'll kill Dr. Joseph!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, no matter how loudly she shouted, he did not seem to hear her and his fingers did not loosen. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing Dr. Joseph's face turning purple and his tongue sticking out, Grace reached out and grabbed Jason's hands. "Jay, let go. Let go! If you don't let go, you'll..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before she could finish, Jason suddenly let go of Dr. Joseph and grabbed her hand that was trying to pry his fingers away just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace felt a sharp pain in her hand. It seemed to make her experience once again how her finger bones were crushed back then. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Ouch!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace almost fainted from the pain. She heard Jason's hoarse voice in her ear. "Why did you leave? Why... You promised me that you'd never... leave. Why..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jay... Jay...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She opened her eyes in difficulty, and his handsome face was in front of her. However, it was contorted with pain. </p></div>
