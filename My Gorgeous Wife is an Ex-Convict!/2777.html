        <h1>Chapter 2775</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he was the crown prince of the entertainment industry, so he probably would not randomly attend other people's birthday parties. Besides, she had only met Brian briefly when Valda was hospitalized. They had not even talked to each other!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll ask him, then," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I've booked three tables in the private room anyway. There are seats available," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Valda Theller called Brian at home at night. "My friend is celebrating her birthday tomorrow night. It's Camille whom I told you about. Do you... uh... want to go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want me to go?" Brian asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille's my best friend. We can go together if you're free. If you're not&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish, he said, "Okay, I'll go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was delighted. 'Did he really say yes?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll pick you up tomorrow evening," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," she replied. When she ended the phone call, she had a sudden feeling of joy in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could feel that Brian was gradually accepting her and joining her world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he might not like her now, let alone love her, he was trying hard like he said he would.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Perhaps he'll slowly fall for me... ' She hoped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next evening, Brian came to the studio to pick up Valda Theller. Since she was attending her best friend's birthday party, Valda Theller deliberately dressed up. She wore a light blue long dress. Her hair, which was always up in a casual ponytail, was put down. She looked fresh and sweet with light makeup on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was stunned by Valda Theller's appearance today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had seen many beautiful women. Of course, Valda Theller was no match for the beautiful women in the entertainment industry. However, her makeup made people feel comfortable. It was not overwhelming but could make one feel relaxed around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to find her beautiful when she smiled sweetly at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why aren't you wearing any jewelry? The necklace you wore to the banquet can go with your outfit today," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stuck out her tongue. "That necklace is too expensive. Everyone will probably focus on my neck if I wear the necklace today. Camille's the star this evening."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was thoughtless. I'll buy you some low-key jewelry you can wear daily next time," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks, I seldom wear jewelry." Valda Theller waved her hand, not wanting him to spend money on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said nothing more. The two got into the car, and he drove to the restaurant Valda Theller mentioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After reaching the private room where Camille Strickland's birthday party was held, Valda Theller said with a smile, "Happy birthday." She gave Zhou Ximian the birthday gift as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thanks." Camille Strickland took it, but she had no idea what the gift was because it was wrapped in wrapping paper. She did not tear it open either. Instead of the gift, she focused on Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had met him briefly when they were in the hospital last time. Besides, the atmosphere at the time prevented her from seeing Brian up close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that she was looking at him up close, Camille Strickland found Brian far better looking than the news photos she found online.</p></div>
