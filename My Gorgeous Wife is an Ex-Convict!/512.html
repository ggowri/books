        <h1>Chapter 511</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes widened, and Jason immediately knew he was right when he saw her reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Which intimate moment?" His voice, softer than ever, seemed to sway over her heart like a feather. "Was it that night? Were you thinking about that night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately felt as if her face was on fire. A look of embarrassment and shyness came over her face, and she almost wanted to bury herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his fingers were still under her chin, making it impossible for her to turn away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way she blushed struck him as indescribably cute. Her misty eyes kept avoiding his gaze, but she did not know that the way she looked would only further arouse the man&rsquo;s desire to possess her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they were not in the car right now and if they were not about to arrive at the party, he probably would not have been able to resist&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you shy? What is there to be shy about?" His fingers brushed gently against her hot cheek. "Isn't it natural for men and women to be attracted to each other?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His scent surrounded her. His voice rang in her ears like some kind of spell, constantly attracting her. "Were you happy that night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was terribly hot, but when she looked into his serious eyes, she was startled. He was asking the question very seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her answer was important to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the answer was a little difficult for her to say, she still followed her heart and replied, "Yes, I was happy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a smile on his lips, and it was beautiful...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was happy too, so you'll want me again, won't you?" he asked softly, his dark eyes burning with an inconcealable desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The burning desire was just because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at him, feeling as if she was going to get lost in his smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would she want to? Would she want him again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The madness of that night came back to her, especially his murmurs and gasps that rang in her ears. It was as if he was deliberately trying to please and satisfy her... It was as if he was doing everything to make her infatuated with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could she not want him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she was embarrassed, Grace nodded her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's smile suddenly became more obvious. "All right, I'll give you anything you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she wanted it, he would give her everything he had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the only one in the world who could make him do this, and she was the only one who could make him love this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never thought that one day he would love someone so much. Now that he had really fallen in love though, he found himself to be willing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He willingly fell in love with her and would willingly kneel before her just to get her affection.</p></div>
