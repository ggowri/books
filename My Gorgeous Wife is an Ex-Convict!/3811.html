        <h1>Chapter 3809</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the construction site is demolished, her body will be mixed in with this pile of abandoned building debris. Even if someone discovers it, it's very likely to be considered an accident caused by her mistakenly entering here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, this place used to be her alma mater. It's believable that she snuck in to take a look because she missed her soon-to-be demolished school!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And is Daniel planning to lure Mason here? Then he can make Mason's death look like an accident too?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Veronica breaks out in a cold sweat. If it's really like this, then Daniel is truly terrifying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's become so extreme that he doesn't even value human life anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she used to have some pity and sympathy for Daniel, now she has none left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only regrets not letting Mason beat up Daniel that day. She should have made sure Daniel was hospitalized for a year or two!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had known that Daniel had become so extreme, she should have been more cautious instead of foolishly going to Daniel's place alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her current situation is entirely her own fault!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... she doesn't want to die!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She still has many things she wants to do. Also, if she really dies, will it not cause pain for Mason? Even if he no longer loves her, if he knows that she was kidnapped and scared because of him, will he not blame himself? Will he not be sad?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of her death possibly causing some kind of shadow for Mason makes Veronica's will to survive even stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She can't die, but what can she do now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her upper body was tightly bound to the pillar, unable to move even though her legs were not tied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Veronica had a flash of inspiration and stared intently at her own feet. She was wearing a pair of ordinary black leather shoes with a heel of only about 4cm, but there were spikes in the heel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just two days ago, she felt that the heel was a bit unstable and felt like it was about to come off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Daniel hadn't kidnapped her, she would have gone to the shoemaker in her own community to have the heel of her shoes re-nailed after leaving Daniel's residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could pull out the spikes... maybe she could break the rope!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Veronica became excited and began to take off her shoes and then her socks!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The few simple movements that were usually easy for her had become much more difficult now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, she managed to take off her socks and then looked at her two shoes. She remembered that the left shoe had a loose heel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she picked up the shoe with her toes and slowly bent her leg backwards, trying to </span><span>get her hand to take off the shoe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the shoe was already heavy, and coupled with being tied up, trying to get her hand to take off the shoe was like a physical challenge.</span></p></div>
