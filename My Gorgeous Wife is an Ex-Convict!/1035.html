        <h1>Chapter 1034</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised the corner of her lips, and her fingers suddenly moved to caress his eyes and eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyelashes fluttered but did not move, and the hands he had pressed against the back of her hands slowly loosened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Little by little, her fingers ran from his eyebrows to his eyes to the bridge of his nose and then to his lips. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips were good-looking. His slightly thin lips looked somewhat cold, sexy, and seductive. When his lips curved and smiled, they easily stirred her heartstrings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You said you're afraid you'll repeat your father's mistakes and lose control of your destiny. Can I take it to mean you're afraid that I'll betray your feelings just like your mother did to your father?" she spoke softly like a sweet violin, saying the words with no resentment or anger&mdash;only the calm after a storm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her calmness made him frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had also been this calm when they were in her rental house the last time. She was so calm that it made him flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even when I told you I loved you and wouldn&rsquo;t leave you, and even when you said you believed me, you never did. That's why you chose to break up, isn't it?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His brows furrowed even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You said you love me and want to be with me, but when you said you&rsquo;ll give me your life, it's because you still think that I might betray you&hellip; Just like how your mother betrayed your father," she continued saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Struggle flashed across Jason's eyes. "As long as I&hellip; believe you, will you love me and get back together with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said lightly, "What makes you think I'll love you again even if you&rsquo;ll believe me? Maybe you believe me now, but you won't believe me in the future. Besides..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took back her hand, her finger gently pointing to her heart. "This used to love you, but not anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His pupils shrank as his face turned pale instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said hoarsely, "Then tell me what it&rsquo;ll take to make you love me again. I'll do anything you ask me to do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she would not be this disappointed, as long as she could love him again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said calmly, "No way! Jason, you were never a man I can afford to love. Even if you believe me now, you still won't believe me someday. You&rsquo;ll stop loving me at will again. The only one you believe is yourself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips quivered. "You don't believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled faintly. Her eyelashes lowered slightly, covering the bitterness in her eyes. "Yeah. I don't believe you, so I don't love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their love was ruined beyond recognition, and it could never be the same again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace let out a long breath once she left Reed Residence. When she said those last words, all the expressions on his face seemed to fade away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not prevent her from coming out, but as she got out of the mourning hall, she could not help but look back. She saw how lonely and fragile his back looked as he stood before his father's tablet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was the only one left in this world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There seemed to be a dull ache in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She told herself, 'Don't feel sorry for this man. It has never been my right to feel sorry for him! Besides, we&rsquo;re two horizons that shouldn't be crossed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's just going back to square one!'</p></div>
