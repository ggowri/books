        <h1>Chapter 3961</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she felt a slight depression next to her, as if someone's weight was pressing down on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then Mick's voice came through the blanket and into her ears, "Nancy, I don't usually sleep with other people. Do you understand?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he said he didn't usually do it, he had already slept with her twice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them lay quietly on the bed like this. Nancy didn't know how long it had been before she pulled the blanket off her head and turned to look at Mick lying next to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next moment, her gaze met his dark eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wasn't sleeping, he had been watching her all along.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you..." Nancy pursed her lips and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really should thank me properly, so from now on, you need to repay me well." Mick's voice was calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you want me to repay you?" If she had to repay him, at least it would make her feel a little better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Mick didn't need her to repay him, she would feel even more guilty towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just now, she had indeed had a nightmare, but after she hugged him, she slowly woke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what she said to him later was not an uncontrollable outpouring of fear, but something she deliberately said to Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just unexpected that Mick would agree not to let Clarissa get away with it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his words, Clarissa's fate was almost sealed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, she should be able to see Clarissa being thrown into jail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She should be happy that her plan succeeded and her revenge is about to be fulfilled, but at the same time, she feels guilty about Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From beginning to end, she only used his affection for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you think? How can you repay me?" Mick asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anything I can give, I will give it all." Nancy said eagerly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anything?" He raised his eyebrows, as if waiting for the little prey to jump down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." She promised that even if he wanted her body now, she would not hesitate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then for the rest of your life, don't fall in love with any man other than me." Mick spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was stunned, blinking her eyes, as if she was a little skeptical of what she heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, can't do it?" He asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you bring this up..." She asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I don't want the woman I like to still like other men. I don't like to share in this matter." Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's expression became even more stunned. What did he mean by that sentence he just said? Could it be... "You... like me?" She asked in a trembling voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Nancy, I like you." Mick said seriously, "So, don't like any other men anymore, okay? In the future, stay by my side forever."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had no resistance to liking her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her car accident made him completely understand his own feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"From now on, I will protect you, accompany you, and never let you feel sad or scared again," Mick said softly. He had never really felt anything for love before, and if he never fell in love with anyone else in his life, he wouldn't feel any regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he felt that if he hadn't met her in this life, it would have been a regret.</span></p></div>
