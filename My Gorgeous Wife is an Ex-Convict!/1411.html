        <h1>Chapter 1410</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Gullible... Tell me about it. I'm indeed gullible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Paisley Daniels has fooled me for so many years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What could be more ridiculous than the fact that all this time, the one I&rsquo;ve been trying to protect is the one I&rsquo;ve retaliated hard against?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">For two days, he stayed in his hotel room without even knowing how to face Kyla Corbyn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What should I say? Should I say I'm sorry? Or make it up to her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All this time, he had only regarded her as the daughter of his enemy. However, she had now become his savior. For a moment, he did not even know how to accept the change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he had found out in time that Paisley Daniels was tricking him and if the person who appeared in front of him had been Kyla Corbyn, would all these things have never happened?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even if she was the daughter of his enemy, he could have let go of his hatred and not hurt her like that. He would not have eventually made her... hate him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, his phone rang. Martin Weiss picked up his phone and pressed the answer button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Weiss, we've looked into the matter you asked us to investigate. Back then..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The voice on the other end of the line made Martin Weiss's heart sink, but he also felt&hellip; that everything was just as he had expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It turned out that he was indeed a fool!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A complete fool!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even the Daniels family and Paisley Daniels could make a fool of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels was restless in the ward. She could not get through to Martin Weiss's phone and he did not reply to her messages either, which made her even more uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'With the speed of how information flows now, Martin must have seen the video!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Even if he has no idea now, others will tell him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And... no one from the Weiss family has called me to ask whether the incident in the video is true. It seems as if the Weiss family has cut me off overnight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'No! I must find a way to meet Martin!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'The longer I delay this, the bigger the hidden danger!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With this in mind, Paisley Daniels wanted to be discharged from the hospital to see Martin Weiss when the door of the ward was pushed open. Martin Weiss walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The three members of the Daniels family who were in the ward were all surprised. Then, Mr. Daniels spoke first, "Martin, you... You're finally here. What the internet is saying isn&rsquo;t true. Someone's deliberately framing Paisley! They probably put on a show with someone who looks similar to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Daniels nodded quickly and said, "Yes, yes! Someone is framing Paisley. Martin, your relationship with Paisley over the years isn't that fragile, is it? Don't be fooled so easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Fooled?" Martin Weiss muttered suddenly. His hoarse voice sounded dangerous. "Indeed. I've been fooled for so many years! Am I too gullible? Is that why I would mistaken wrong from right?&rdquo;</p></div>
