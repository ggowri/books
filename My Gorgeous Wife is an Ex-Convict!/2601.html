        <h1>Chapter 2599</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Biting her lip, she got up and asked the servant where Martin Weiss's bedroom was. Then, she walked up the stairs and came to his bedroom door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After two knocks on the door, she heard someone say, "Come in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after she pushed the door open, she suddenly saw Martin Weiss stripped down to the waist. A woman was helping him put on a shirt. She stood in front of him as she helped him button up his shirt. Kyla was standing behind her, so she could not see what she looked like. She could tell it was a woman from her figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla instantly felt a stab in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does it bother me? Or am I jealous that he's in such close proximity to another woman?&rsquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss turned his head slightly. After glancing at Kyla, who had entered, he turned back. It seemed like he could not be bothered. to give her another glance. "It's you. What do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'd like to have dinner with you," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss rejected indifferently. "No thanks. I'm used to eating alone. If there&rsquo;s nothing else, I wish to have a quiet meal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The statement was undoubtedly a dismissal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman buttoning Martin Weiss's shirt was done buttoning his shirt. She took another coat for Martin Weiss to wear. Then, she walked up to Kyla. "You'd better leave first. Mr. Weiss is about to have dinner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she sounded polite and respectful, her eyes and expression had no respect and only disdain for Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at the young woman brimming with youthfulness. She had an oval-shaped face and arched eyebrows. Those bright eyes made Kyla think of her old self.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked a little like her when she was young and full of hope for the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her state of mind was different now. The only thing that remained was perhaps... her love for Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had loved blindly and did not understand love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She fell in love again after understanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked past her and at Martin Weiss. "Martin Weiss, do you want me to leave?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I want you to leave," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She laughed at herself. 'What kind of answer was I expecting?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes darkened slightly as she withdrew from the room and quietly closed the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There seemed to be an invisible wall between her and Martin Weiss. No matter how much she wanted to get close, she could not get close to him at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Calm down&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought to herself. Their bet had just started. They had three months. Perhaps she could make him&hellip; fall in love with her again in these three months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She finally understood how Martin Weiss felt when he wanted her to give him another chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She now hoped Martin Weiss could give her a chance to get close to him too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the bedroom, Shana Nicholls was secretly pleased when she saw Martin Weiss's indifference to Kyla just now. Sure enough, the so-called Mrs. Weiss did not carry much weight in Mr. Weiss's heart.</p></div>
