        <h1>Chapter 2425</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he did not even have such strong feelings, then... what would he be left with?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like the state he was in now. Even if he no longer felt the pain of not getting what he wanted, he felt empty as if he had lost something important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss pushed the hotel room door open, he saw that the lights in the room were still switched on. Kyla lay on the couch, still awake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're back," she said. However, she was startled when she saw the bruises on his face that he had gotten from the fight. She hurried forward with a worried look and asked, "What happened to your face? What happened? Have you... been drinking?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she approached him, the smell of alcohol rushed to the tip of her nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "I drank a little. Go to bed first. I'll wash up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He walked over to the closet, got a change of clothes, and went into the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The warm water washed over him. Besides his face, his body had endured many punches. There was a faint pain when the water washed over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Do I regret it?' he asked himself suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He slowly raised his hand and pressed it against his heart. The empty feeling in his chest was still so vivid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss came out of the bathroom, he found that Kyla was still awake. She was sitting on the couch, waiting for him. A medical kit was on the coffee table in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I asked for it from room service. You're injured. You'd better apply some medicine," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss coldly refused. "No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he was about to reach the bed when her hand grabbed his. She said, "Apply some medicine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her darkly. "I said no."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She met his eyes. "But you said we're married now, and your body doesn't belong to you alone. It belongs to the family. Shouldn't a husband take good care of himself for his wife and children?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The look in his eyes changed slightly when he heard the words &lsquo;husband&rsquo; and &lsquo;wife&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a worried look in her eyes that made him feel as if they were a real married couple and she was his wife who loved him deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla pressed Martin Weiss down on the couch. He sat almost obediently. Then, she opened the medical kit and began to apply medicine to his bruises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said as she applied the medicine, "You should be careful with your injuries. You shouldn't let them come into contact with water right away, but&hellip; you&rsquo;ve already taken a bath. You should be more cautious from now on, or your wounds will become inflamed." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her fingers smeared the ointment evenly over his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The warmth of her fingertips seemed to seep through his skin and went into his heart little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss only felt as if he was flustered again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, her fingers began to pull his bathrobe open. He snapped back to his senses and grabbed her hand. "What are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh... I want to see if you have any injuries on your body. If there are, I can apply the ointment for you," she said. After all, his face was bruised, so his body must be injured too.</p></div>
