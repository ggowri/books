        <h1>Chapter 563</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tears were...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, as if there was a needle pricking in her mind, she felt a sudden pain&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know what? I miss you so much... I miss you..." he muttered as his face drew closer and closer, his lips almost touching hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pow!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A clear slap rang in the darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace panted slightly, the palm of her right hand had a burning pain&mdash;a sign of how hard she slapped him just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's face was slapped to one side. The air around him seemed to freeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, he slowly turned his head with his eyes fixed on her. Only now, his eyes were no longer blurry like just now. They had become a lot clearer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers slowly loosened their hold on her, and without saying a word, he turned and staggered into a nearby car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only then that Grace put her hand up against her head which was still throbbing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why did she have a headache when she saw Brian's tears just now? It was as if she was triggered by something. A terrible feeling even welled up in her heart at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why... Was she so upset? It was as if her body did not want to see him cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Grace could not explain why she felt this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, in another dark corner not far away, Evelyn gritted her teeth as she looked at Grace's back with a fierce, malevolent look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today, she had followed Brian to the town and watched him stand like a fool in front of the hill for hours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She almost stood with him until her legs ached to the point of collapse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, Brian went to a restaurant in the town and had a drink. She had never seen him drink like this&mdash;one drink after another as if he intended on getting himself drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was secretly pleased, thinking that if he got drunk tonight, it might be an opportunity for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could find an opportunity to approach him, and maybe something would happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, unexpectedly, he came here to meet Grace next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just now... They almost kissed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why... Did he do this to Grace when he clearly did not know that Grace was the little girl in his painting?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace already had Jason, but she was still trying to mess with her Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she really could not keep Brian one day, she would surely make Grace pay for it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn swore in her heart with a twisted expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, Grace had her chin in her hands as she looked at Jason who was working in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He insisted on having her by his side when he was working. He euphemistically said that her presence made him feel less tired.</p></div>
