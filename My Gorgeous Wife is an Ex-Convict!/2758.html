        <h1>Chapter 2756</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt relaxed spending time with Valda Theller. Maybe it would be a good choice to continue things with her like this. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he could fall in love with Valda Theller, it would be the best for everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Opening his eyes slowly, Brian looked at the silver bracelet on his wrist. "Grace, I&rsquo;ll fulfill any wish you have."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would also try his best to fall for another person!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, the executives of Hart Group were surprised to find their boss wearing a silver bracelet on his wrist. It was hard to imagine someone like the crown prince wearing silver. Someone even searched for the bracelet on luxury platforms, but no one found it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The silver bracelet became part of the employees' gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Patrick came looking for Brian, he naturally saw the silver bracelet too. He was not an employee, so he asked right away, "Why are you wearing a bracelet like that? Did you get it from street stalls?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick had a keen eye. He had seen countless fine jewelry and could easily tell that the bracelet was not of any high quality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, it's 700 dollars for two," Brian said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was confused. "Why would you buy things from street stalls?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't. It's from Valda. They're couple bracelets," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Pfft!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick almost spat out the tea he was drinking. "Couple bracelets?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to Patrick's shock, Brian looked calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect Valda Theller to make you wear such bracelets." Patrick lamented.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm serious about her," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How serious?" Patrick was curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're dating on the premise of marriage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick really spat out his tea this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned as Patrick quickly took out a tissue to wipe it. Patrick said, "Are you planning on marrying her someday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;ll marry her if our relationship is stable," said Brian. When she fell for him and he could fall for her, it was only natural for them to get married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, he even felt he would marry her even if he did not love her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was willing to make her Mrs. Hart, provide her with a good life, and let her be under his protection for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... t would seem unfair to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he was willing to have a marriage like this, she might not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was dumbstruck. "What a... surprise. I thought you were never going to get married. Do your parents know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I haven't told them yet. I'll tell them when our relationship is more stable," said Brian.</p></div>
