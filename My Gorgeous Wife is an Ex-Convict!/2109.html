        <h1>Chapter 2107</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Do you have to be all lovey-dovey to get married?" Martin Weiss asked unhappily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You two look like you have no feelings for each other. Even if you do get married, you&rsquo;ll divorce sooner or later," the woman said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she quickly felt terrified as a chill shot up from the soles of her feet and crept up her spine. The man before her was staring at her with bloodthirst in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The woman dared not say anything, but Kyla knew Martin Weiss was angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She's just an outsider," Kyla could not help saying. After all, this woman was also a victim in marriage, and they were only having a casual conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was no need for Martin Weiss to be angry with this woman because of what she just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes moved to Kyla. The rage in his eyes slowly subsided and eventually returned to normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For a moment, he had flown into an uncontrollable rage. It was because this woman said... &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll divorce sooner or later".</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though he knew their marriage was only expedient, he still could not help but fantasize that she would not divorce him and was willing to be with him forever when the time came!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, it was Martin Weiss and Kyla's turn. The two got up, went to Window 5, and handed their IDs and household registration certificate to the staff member.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After filling in the registration form, it was time to take the photo for their marriage license.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla and Martin Weiss followed the photographer's instructions to sit in chairs and face the camera, but the photographer did not accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter with you two? You're here to get married and are going to become husband and wife. Put your heads closer together and smile a little more! You'll only look like you're getting married that way!" the photographer mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "Sir, it doesn't matter. Just take the photo. It's just for the marriage license anyway."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla spoke nonchalantly as if she did not care how the photos would turn out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then... Then I'm gonna take the photo! Don't complain if it turns out bad." The photographer snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," Kyla said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss only smiled bitterly and said nothing. 'She... won't even smile with me for our wedding photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'She's just getting married to me for the kids.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But it's my wedding day today, and I'm marrying the only woman I want to marry!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The photos were soon taken, and the photographer said, "You're going to go on stage and take your vows before getting the marriage license. Do you want your photos taken when you take your vows? A photographer will be there to take photos, and you can choose seven photos that will be printed out on the spot. You'll only have to pay 50 dollars. They'll serve as souvenirs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Generally speaking, many couples would choose this service. After all, 50 dollars was not much, and these photos would be a souvenir for a lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, without any consideration, Kyla said, "No thanks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The photographer looked at Martin Weiss, and Martin Weiss said indifferently, "Since she said no, then no thanks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When it was time for them to take their vows, the newlyweds were required to follow the staff and recite their wedding vows word for word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"... From this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, in youth and in old age, we will stand together through thick and thin and be lifelong partners..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla and Martin Weiss recited in unison.</p></div>
