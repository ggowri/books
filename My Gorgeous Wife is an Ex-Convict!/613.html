        <h1>Chapter 612</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If one day Jason was gone&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help laughing. What was wrong with her? Jason was not Brian, and she was not Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Grace, did you see the news about Evelyn?&rsquo; Lina sent a message from her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Is this not karma? She thought she was clever, but what's the use of such petty tricks? Didn't she just end up getting eliminated all the same?&rsquo; said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's reputation was now thoroughly tarnished. No dignified man would want anything to do with Evelyn. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;By the way, I also heard that Brian warned Evelyn. Do you know that he wanted her and her family to leave Emerald City?&rsquo; Lina told her the gossip she heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she heard this gossip from Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not many people in the entertainment industry knew about it. Lina praised Hadwin greatly for this, saying he had great potential for inquiring gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Hadwin only rolled his eyes at her praises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She did not expect Brian to say that. Maybe&hellip; One of the reasons her father wanted to sell the old Cummins family house was because of this. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, whether or not they left Emerald City had nothing to do with her as they were no longer family to her from the day she went to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina chatted with Grace for a while more before putting down her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You seem to be in a good mood." Hadwin's voice suddenly rang in Lina's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was startled, then remembered that there was another person in front of her. She was kind of on a date with him&hellip; Um, right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!" After speaking, Lina went back to eating the dessert in front of her. Evelyn's present situation was as bad as being struck by lightning. How could she be in a bad mood?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just because of what happened to Evelyn?" he asked as he raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me about it. I knew Evelyn was not a good person from the start. With her situation now, there's divine justice after all!" said Lina. Looking at how people cursed Evelyn on her phone, she felt refreshed and even her appetite improved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's divine justice?" Hadwin suddenly laughed and looked at Lina as if he heard a joke. "Do you think there's divine justice?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina paused with her hand holding a small spoon. She looked at him in confusion. "What else could it be?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Only a fool like you would think there's divine justice. Don't you think it's too much of a coincidence?" said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Coincidence?" Lina was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It has only been a short time since Evelyn framed Grace. It's no secret that the director, who was in this scandal with Evelyn, was a playboy. Everyone in the industry knows that he likes to toy with actresses. Why did the director&rsquo;s wife only catch him with Evelyn?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin analyzed. With that, Lina was suddenly stunned. "Is this directed against Evelyn?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The timing was too good. They caught them red-handed and the video went straight to the internet. Isn't it usually better to negotiate using the video to get what you want? However, the director's wife did not even give her a chance to negotiate. It was as if she just wanted to destroy her completely. She would not get anything out of this. Even uploading such videos is at risk of getting a lawsuit."</p></div>
