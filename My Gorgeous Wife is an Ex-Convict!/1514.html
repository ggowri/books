        <h1>Chapter 1512</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;You can leave now,&rdquo; Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The tutor left the room, leaving only father and son in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked at the jigsaw puzzle his son was playing with. There were about 1,000 pieces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The average adult would have to spend 10 to 15 days to complete such a puzzle. However, when it came to this young boy, it was as if completing this puzzle was an effortless task. He put them together piece by piece at an extremely fast speed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked at the puzzle his son was putting together. It depicted two boys and one girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Back then when he woke up in the hospital, Terrence told him that he had a wife named Grace and they had triplets together. At last, though, Grace fell into the sea and only one child survived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When his son grew up, he heard everything about the triplets. He then stubbornly thought that he should have a younger brother and a younger sister. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason had found it strange at once. &ldquo;Why a younger brother and a younger sister instead of two younger brothers or two younger sisters?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;No reason,&rdquo; the kid had replied to him with a cute voice, as if it was a given that the other two should be a younger brother and a younger sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason sat down beside his son and watched quietly as the child finished his puzzle. He considered for a while before saying, &ldquo;If you really want a younger brother, I can adopt one for you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He only adopted the girl because his son suddenly wanted a younger sister after stumbling into Irene Lynch and her daughter on the streets. The two of them were being abused and bullied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As such, he had someone look for them and told them that the Reed family would pay for all of Oriel Lynch&rsquo;s expenses until she was of age if she was willing to be an adopted daughter of the Reed family. The Reed family would also ensure that both mother and daughter were not bullied. The Reed family would be their protective shield as long as they did not cause trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Also, Oriel Lynch would only be adopted by name. Irene Lynch would not be separated from her daughter, and they would also not need to move into Reed Residence. The Reed family later purchased a villa for them to live in, and a sum of money intended for child support was transferred into Irene Lynch&rsquo;s account every month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was a big sum of 200,000 dollars every month. It was pocket money for Irene Lynch and her daughter. There were also Oriel Lynch&rsquo;s preschool fees and other huge expenses such as medical fees. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">To the mother and daughter, it was as if money had dropped from the sky. Irene Lynch agreed to everything without a second thought. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, after Oriel Lynch became an adopted daughter of the Reed family, Jason noticed that his son had not really taken a liking to his adopted younger sister. He merely greeted her when they met and did not play together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo; Mick Reed shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a younger brother.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had a younger sister now, anyway. He already knew what it felt like to have a younger sister. Usually, when he saw her, she was always there tagging behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On some other occasions, he had happened to see his younger sister boast about various trinkets in front of other children while claiming that they were given to her by Daddy. However, Daddy had done nothing of the sort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It turned out that having a younger sister was just that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Daddy, will you get married to Aunty Lynch?&rdquo; Mick Reed suddenly asked. He looked up into Jason&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had a face that was extremely similar to Jason&rsquo;s. It was as if he was a mini version of Jason with his delicate features, ebony hair, and pale, smooth skin that looked so soft anyone would have the urge to bite his cheek. </p></div>
