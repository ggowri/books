        <h1>Chapter 1346</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, people from small companies did not have the chance to come close to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was surprised at first, but the more she heard, the more she felt something was wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's... too many. How could all these people just happen to be attending this class with their pregnant wives?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the hospital had set up many pregnancy classes with different time slots so the pregnant ladies could attend the classes according to their schedule.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace felt that even if the wives of the wealthy in Emerald City all chose this hospital, no matter how she thought about it... It was too exaggerated for them to all gather in one class!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why... are there so many of them?" she exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It must&rsquo;ve been intentional." Jason smiled faintly as if he was not surprised by the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Intentional?" Grace was stunned. Then, as if realizing something, her eyes widened and she said, "Could they&hellip; have known that you'd here? Is that why... they're here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll find out when the class is over," Jason said with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the end of the class, quite a few people came up to greet Grace and Jason just as they were about to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were the same people whom Jason had mentioned earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, they... were really here for Jay?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If one were to take a picture of all this, people would probably think these big shots were having a summit dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought it was at a pregnancy class?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a look at the big shots and their wives who surrounded her and Jason. She had a feeling that they could have more than three or four tables of mahjong. Add in the wives, and they could have seven or eight tables!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could almost expect to see more of these big shots and their wives in future pregnancy classes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the afternoon, Kyla Corbyn prepared the ingredients for the food stall and went into her bedroom to change her clothes when she found her mother hanging up the phone. She was murmuring, "How could someone be so ungrateful? How could they?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn kept wiping her tears as she harped on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn stepped forward and asked, "Mom, what's wrong? What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No-Nothing," Mrs. Corbyn said quickly, trying to contain her emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn sighed and walked over to her mother. "Mom, what on earth happened? Are there things that we can&rsquo;t tell each other?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn looked at her daughter, and her heart ached even more for her. "I... I just called the hospital where you donated your bone marrow before. I told them about your situation and asked if they could contact the person who received your bone marrow to donate their liver to you. However, the hospital just called me and said they had already contacted the person. They refused to donate!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn clenched her teeth at that. "If we had known they were so heartless, you wouldn't have to donate your bone marrow to them!"</p></div>
