        <h1>Chapter 4070</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not saying it too early. I know my feelings, so of course I have to say it!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But do you know what my other looks are like?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know, but I think I would love you no matter what. If you're worried, you can show me your other looks. I haven't seen them, so why do you think I'm saying it too early?" Tina retorted. "Also, I'm not young anymore. In two years, I can marry you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler withdrew his hand, turned around, and faced away from Tina. "Maybe soon, you'll really see another side of me. Then, Tina, I hope what you said is true, that you'll love me no matter what I look like."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that were true, then it must be heaven's mercy on him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although in the end, Tina didn't have sex with Chandler, she understood her feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She liked touching him, even looked forward to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, it can be proven that she loves him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Chandler loves her too, so that's enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's a beautiful mutual affection!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the thought of Chandler returning to his hometown soon and being away for a month made Tina feel a little anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not being able to see him for a month and having no way to communicate, she would probably miss him a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? You're sighing again," Lina looked at her daughter's listless appearance and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, I also want to go to Chandler's hometown with him," Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Lina was surprised, "Did Chandler invite you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, Chandler himself is going back, but this time he'll be gone for a month. You know, once he's back in his hometown, we can't even call him, let alone video chat!" Tina said, "I mean, I'm his fianc&eacute;e, it's only right that I accompany him on a trip to his hometown."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina had met some of Hunter's elders before. On her 15th birthday, Hunter gave her many valuable gifts, and many of Hunter's elders attended her birthday banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those valuable gifts, even though Tina had seen many precious things from childhood to adulthood, still made her unable to help but marvel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially Hunter, who gave her a 15-carat Burmese ruby necklace, which is priceless!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it also shows how much Hunter values her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At 15 years old, it is the age of a girl's coming of age, which means that after this, she can get married!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to current laws, women must be at least 18 years old to get married. Therefore, her 15th birthday party was more like an engagement party between her and Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hunter is very mysterious. If they didn't invite you, don't think too much about it. Chandler will bring you there in the future," Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom, why did Chandler want me to marry him in the future?" Tina asked. "Do you know the reason? Chandler always said he would tell me the reason later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know almost the same as you," Lina said. "Your father made a promise with Chandler to save me. Later, your father spent a lot of effort investigating Hunter, but all the information he could find was superficial. Hunter is very mysterious. When your father sent someone to investigate Hunter's family, Hunter found out and almost didn't let them come back. The relationship between the two families almost broke down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina still shudders when she thinks about that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened? Mom, please tell me!" Tina suddenly became interested. This was something she had never known before!</p></div>
