        <h1>Chapter 3240</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you, William!" Jasper said with a smile, giving William a big hug.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Lawrence suddenly felt a little envious of William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Jasper pulled Lawrence to sit in front of the piano and started playing a piece for everyone to listen to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence is playing the piano. These days, he has been receiving guidance from a teacher who is teaching him about piano playing. As a result, he has made significant progress in his technique. Previously, he had some areas where he was not very smooth, but now he has corrected those issues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William listened quietly, his young face displaying an unusual seriousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hearing it live like this is much more impactful than watching a video beforehand. He can now better understand why Jasper loves the Lawrence piano so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound of the music that evokes such a feeling, perhaps he will never be able to play it himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If we were to compare natural talent in playing the piano, he has actually lost to Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just like his previous teacher's evaluation, he has reached a level of skill that can rival many professional pianists, but his piano playing seems to lack emotion and fails to resonate with others on a deeper level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he simply cannot integrate his emotions into the music he plays.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a song ended, Jasper took the initiative to ask William, "Isn't Lawrence's playing very beautiful?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it sounds very nice," William smiled and replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper casually said to Lawrence, "I knew it, William will definitely love your music."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence gave a shy smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the evening, Lawrence left the Reed House and went back home with the gift that William had given him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he opened the gift box, he saw a children's watch inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many of his classmates wear children's watches, but he doesn't have one. Although he envies them, he hasn't asked his parents for one because he knows their financial situation isn't good and children's watches cost over a hundred yuan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, he has received a children's watch, which is obviously very good and looks better than those worn by his classmates. However, he feels like there is something weighing on his chest, making him uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, who gave you this watch? Was it from Miss Three?" Doran Abbott approached and asked his son, noticing the child's watch in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it was sent today by Mr. Barlow from the Reed family," Lawrence replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Barlow? Is that the same person who stayed with the Reed family a few years ago, and later discovered that he was a child from a wealthy family who had been lost and was brought back to Deer Capital by his biological father?" Wilona also walked over and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During this period, she also got to know some of the Reed family's servants. These servants knew that her son had recently become a favorite of Miss Reed, so they naturally tried to please her. She also learned a lot of gossip from these servants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's matter is also one of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, Wilona had mentioned William's matter several times at home. Because William had a good relationship with Jasper, Wilona specifically reminded her son to also get close to Mr. Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it's this Mr. Barlow," Lawrence replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona picked up the children's watch in her son's hand, then took out her phone and searched for the brand of the watch online. Immediately, she exclaimed, "Wow, Mr. Barlow is really rich. The online retail price for this watch model is 130,000!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Doran, who was beside her, was also shocked. Only wealthy families could afford a children's watch that cost 130,000.</p></div>
