        <h1>Chapter 3689</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine hurried over, and upon seeing Veronica, paused for a moment before noticing the sauce and pasta bits on Mason's clothes and the scattered pasta on the ground. "Mason, what happened?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just got my clothes dirty," Mason replied coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina and Chandler also approached at this moment. Chandler furrowed his brow slightly upon seeing the scene, while Tina looked at Mason, Veronica, and the situation and began to suspect something. "Who spilled pasta on Mason?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Many people's eyes turned to Angelica, who looked embarrassed. Tina raised an eyebrow and asked her, "Was it you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what if it was?" Angelica retorted. "I didn't mean to spill it on him. I was scolding my own assistant, and he just happened to run into it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Assistant?" Tina's gaze turned to Veronica. "Are you her assistant, Veronica?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Miss Kinsman wasn't satisfied with the pasta I bought, so..." Veronica bit her lip, feeling embarrassed. She didn't want Mason to see her in such a state, but unfortunately, this was the situation. "Mason helped me block it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's eyes flickered between Veronica and Mason, while Chandler looked surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the middle-aged man who had led Jasmine and the others to meet Derick stepped out of the room and saw the commotion. He hurried over and, upon seeing the obvious pasta stains on Mason's clothes, was shocked. "What...what happened? Who did this?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even pulled out some tissues and began to wipe Mason's clothes, bowing and apologizing profusely. "Mason, I'm so sorry that you had to go through this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other onlookers around were all stunned. After all, most people were aware of this man's identity. However, one of the organizers of the concert, who was usually bowed and scraped to by others, had never seen him apologize to anyone like this before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This could only mean that this man's status and position were far higher than that of the organizer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, many people's eyes turned to Angelica, some with sympathy and some with schadenfreude.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica was also dumbfounded. Who was this man? He made the organizer apologize like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Mason just said coldly, "It's nothing, just some dirt on my clothes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, Mason took off his jacket and put it on a nearby chair. Then he turned to Jasmine and said, "Alright, you've seen the person you wanted to see. Let's go to our seats outside and wait for the concert to start."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh...okay." Jasmine was taken aback for a moment, then followed Mason towards the exit backstage.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as they were leaving, she still said to Veronica, "Veronica, the birthday gift you gave me today, Mason and I are going out first."</span></p></div>
