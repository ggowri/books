        <h1>Chapter 1518</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The person who pushed her daughter away was Irene Lynch, and the little girl holding the other half of the photo was Oriel Lynch, the adopted daughter of the Reed family. Grace had seen photos of this pair of mother and daughter on the internet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before Grace could speak, Irene Lynch harrumphed coldly. &ldquo;Daddy? How are you educating your child that she&rsquo;s calling someone else&rsquo;s father that? Can your child even measure up to him? Quickly, have your daughter say sorry to my daughter! She hurt my daughter! Do you know who my daughter is?&rdquo; Irene Lynch said arrogantly. She would not have come to a restaurant like this if her daughter had not wanted to visit it after having seen it on TV.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">To her, a restaurant for the commoners such as this one was beneath her and her daughter. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Unexpectedly, her daughter had a conflict with someone else and the reason for it was the photo of Jason that had fallen out from the other girl&rsquo;s pocket. The girl also repeatedly claimed that it was a photo of her daddy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Daddy? Irene Lynch looked at the mother and daughter who were dressed commonly with a look of disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason had only one daughter, which was Oriel Lynch. He would only become Oriel Lynch&rsquo;s daddy in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hearing that, Grace glared at Irene Lynch coldly. &ldquo;I know who your daughter is, of course. The adopted daughter of the Reed family, right? I don&rsquo;t need you to tell me if my daughter can measure up to Jason.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There were children present, after all. Grace did not want to say overly acerbic words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Irene Lynch was triggered by what she said about Oriel Lynch&rsquo;s status as an &lsquo;adopted daughter&rsquo;. She hated it when other people said that her daughter was only adopted. Those people who sucked up to her tended to mince their words, calling her daughter the little young lady of the Reed family instead. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need me to tell you? I think you&rsquo;re delusional! You just want to marry into a rich family! You&rsquo;re so shameless! You found this photo somewhere and got your daughter to call him &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo;. What, do you want to be the mistress of the Reed family? Just look at you!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Reed family had destroyed all photos of Grace, so naturally, the photos of Grace had also been taken down from the internet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch knew that Jason had a deceased wife named Grace, but she had not seen photos of her before. It was only normal that she did not know the woman in front of her was Jason&rsquo;s wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Look at you! Who&rsquo;s the shameless one?&rdquo; Lina said to Irene Lynch. Jasper was Jason&rsquo;s biological daughter and her good friend was Jason&rsquo;s wife as stated in his marriage certificate. However, they were subjected to Irene Lynch&rsquo;s ridicule now. This made Lina very angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was incensed. She rushed forward, wanting to give Lina a slap on the face, but Grace reached out and stopped her hand mid-air. &ldquo;What happened before was only an argument between two children. What are you doing, butting in even though you&rsquo;re an adult? Are you planning to make everything worse?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Ever since Oriel Lynch became Jason&rsquo;s adopted daughter, Irene Lynch had gotten used to everyone&rsquo;s flattery. How could she withstand this? She brandished her other hand, about to hit Grace. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was not one to watch her good friend get hit, so the three women ended up brawling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The children, who had started the fight in the first place, watched the adults with their eyes open wide. They each held half of the photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The employees in the restaurant rushed forward and pulled the three women apart. Despite their efforts, all three women ended up suffering injuries somewhere. Irene Lynch had been roughed up the most. Her immaculately combed hair was now as messy as a bird&rsquo;s nest. One of her fake eyelashes had fallen, and her lipstick stained the corner of her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The manager of the restaurant was shocked when he recognized Irene Lynch. </p></div>
