        <h1>Chapter 1968</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers was on the phone with the mother of the Tang family's heiress, explaining last night's accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't worry. Since it didn&rsquo;t work this time, there's always another chance. I hope your daughter will be my daughter-in-law. Yesterday was just a small accident..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before she could finish, she heard the butler's voice. "Young... Young Master, why did you bring so many people here? Did... Did something happen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, Hadwin Stephenson's cold voice sounded. "Get lost!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers looked up and saw her son walking in with a group of his men. Her expression changed slightly, and she said to Mrs. Tang on the other end of the line, "Excuse me, Mrs. Tang. I have something to attend to. I'll talk to you later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After ending the call, Emily Flowers looked at her son and said, "Hadwin, what are your intentions for coming here with such a large group of people?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson walked to the couch and sat down. He said to the men behind him, "Wait outside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes." The men filed out. Now, only Hadwin Stephenson, Emily Flowers, and the butler were left in the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers gave the butler a look, and he left the living room as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked indifferent. He casually took the newspaper Emily Flowers was reading earlier from the coffee table and looked through it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although one could read the news online now, Emily Flowers still maintained the habit of reading newspapers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Compared to Hadwin Stephenson's indifference, Emily Flowers felt uneasy. Her son probably brought so many people here to question her about what had happened yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The older her son grew, the more unpredictable he became. At some point, she could no longer figure out what was on her son's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin, you've asked everyone to leave. Is there something you want to tell me?" asked Emily Flowers when she already knew the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson seemed to say nonchalantly, "I do have to tell you something, Mom. I hope you can temporarily live abroad and then come back after a few years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What?" Emily Flowers instantly stood up and stared at her son in front of her. "What did you say? Are you kicking me abroad?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I&rsquo;m not kicking you there. I'm just 'asking' you to go there," Hadwin Stephenson said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers narrowed her beautiful eyes that were adorned with delicate makeup. "What if I don't want to? I'm doing well here. I don't want to go abroad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you won't do it, I'll have to have people stationed outside your mansion at all times. I'll have them removed whenever you agree to move," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers immediately snapped. "Stationed? Are you trying to lock me up in this mansion? Like a prisoner?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Think of it however you want to, Mom," replied Hadwin Stephenson.</p></div>
