        <h1>Chapter 3542</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was taken aback. Roger...a completely unfamiliar name that had nothing to do with Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, he really isn't Lawrence? Was it all just her overthinking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A strong sense of disappointment welled up in her chest, and she finally let go of his clothes that she had been holding onto.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The boy turned and left, but Jasper remained motionless, standing in place with his head down, staring at his own toes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The mist that had filled her eyes now finally turned into tears, rolling down her cheeks one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe she just wanted Lawrence too much, which led her to mistake that person for Lawrence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hoped Lawrence would be safe and sound and could appear in front of her one day! At that time, she would do everything to make it up to Lawrence and say sorry to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sorry, she didn't answer his call at that time. Sorry, she didn't save him or his parents!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If time could be turned back, she wished she could have answered that call!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that were the case, maybe some things would be different!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper walked around in a daze, and when she came to her senses, she was already in a small bar near the campus.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This bar mainly caters to students, and quite a few Stanford University students come here. The prices are also quite affordable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, it's Jasper's first time here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bar has a refreshing environment, the lighting is not too dim, and since it's still afternoon, there aren't many people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper walked up to the bar counter and casually ordered a cocktail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the cocktail was brought to her, she picked up the glass and took a big sip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not tasty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least the wine here is much worse than what she had tasted before, even to the point of being difficult to drink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, this unpleasant taste is quite fitting for her current mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her fluctuating emotions are like this wine, both bitter and astringent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That person said he wasn't Lawrence at all, but why does she still feel like he is? Is it because she misses Lawrence too much? So anyone who can play the piano and looks a bit like Lawrence from her childhood, she mistakes for him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence... Can she find him again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she has always insisted that he is not dead and must still be alive, after so many years, even she herself feels that maybe she is just deceiving herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper is naturally beautiful. Sitting alone at the bar, she exudes a sad atmosphere. Just sitting there like that, she easily attracts others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several guys who were originally sitting on the other side also noticed Jasper. They walked over and struck up a conversation with her, saying, "Drinking alone? Why don't you come to our table? We'll treat you, let's drink together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Jasper seemed to be immersed in her own thoughts and completely ignored them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you a student at Stanford University?" asked the group. "We work nearby and could be friends. We have some buddies whose girlfriends are from Stanford University!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of them even reached out to put his arm around Jasper's shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as soon as his hand got close, Jasper's gaze turned cold. "Get lost. I don't want to be friends with you or drink with you."</p></div>
