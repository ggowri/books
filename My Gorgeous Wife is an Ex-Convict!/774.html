        <h1>Chapter 773</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she was still mourning her grandmother and it was the day after the 49th day of her grandmother's death, she did not want to dress in bright colors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did apply a little foundation and put on light makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, with the dexterity of her fingers, she struggled to do so delicately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked down at her fingers and smiled a little. Her fingers could not recover as before, but they were much better now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now, my hands have let Brian go. From now on, I&rsquo;ll only be holding Jay's hands!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Standing up, Grace was about to leave the room when, out of the corner of her eye, she saw that the door connecting the two bedrooms was open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason rarely goes back to his bedroom. It&rsquo;s become a habit that he sleeps with me in mine.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stepped forward, intending to close the door, but when she reached the door, she stepped into his bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay?" she asked. She then saw that no one was in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's not in the room. Is he making my cake in the kitchen downstairs?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered that he had said he would spend the day with her at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was about to turn away when she caught a glimpse of a photo album on a low cabinet nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The photo album was wide open right now, and it contained photos of Jason and his father when he was young!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this... Jay's photo album?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help picking up the photo album. 'Speaking of which, I've never seen Jay's photo album!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace leafed through the photo album, seeing photos of Jason as a child. He was either alone or with his father. There were no photos of his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After going through more than half of the photo album, there were photos of him after the age of seven or eight. The way he dressed was obviously different from before. It was much better, but his eyes no longer had the ignorance of a child. He looked more mature than children of the same age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It must have been&hellip; when his father passed away and he had to return to the Reed family,&rsquo; Grace thought to herself and kept turning the pages. Looking at the photos, he grew taller and taller year by year. He went from being cute in his childhood to being handsome.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in most of these photos, he was expressionless and was always alone. She... did not even see a photo of him with his grandfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it not in this photo album, or... have they never taken a photo together?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace recalled the time Jason stood alone in front of his father's memorial tablet in the mourning hall, and her heart could not help aching again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His father's death was probably a turning point in his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Photos of him before he was seven or eight years old showed a wide range of expressions on his face, from happily laughing to crying and pouting. However, from then on, his expression had become increasingly monotonous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's gaze fell back on a photo of him that looked like he was around three or four years old. He was smiling broadly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but take out her phone and take a picture of it, saving it on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I hope that he&rsquo;ll always smile like that!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was about to close the photo album, she suddenly noticed that the last page of the photo album was blank.</p></div>
