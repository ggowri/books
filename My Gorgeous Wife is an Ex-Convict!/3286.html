        <h1>Chapter 3284</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William took it and said, "I really like all of your gifts."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Would you like to open and take a look?" Jasper asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait until we get back to Deer Capital before opening them slowly," he said, looking at the pile of gifts she had prepared. He then noticed a card with the name Lawrence written on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William hesitated for a moment and asked, "Are you also going to give a gift to Lawrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, he's my friend!" said Jasper naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's expression dimmed slightly as he knew that the people who receive gifts from her on Christmas are the ones she considers important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Are there not many people who receive gifts from her as a friend, besides her family? But now, is Lawrence one of them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, you have many friends, but... can you promise me that I am your most important friend?" William spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at the other person with a hint of confusion in his eyes, wondering what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's heart sank a little. "What's wrong? Is it because of my request? I...I just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he finished speaking, she interrupted and said, "William, your words are strange. Of course, you are my most important friend!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, William was stunned, and the nervousness he had been feeling suddenly disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly raised his hand and hugged the other person. "Yes, I said something strange. Jasper is also the most important person to me..." The last few words of his sentence were muffled in his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To him, she has always been more than just his best friend, she is the most important person to him! More important than his dad, his grandparents, or anyone else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everything he is doing now is for the future when he can stand by her side and truly be with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, I will work very hard, very hard... to become someone who deserves her, instead of being known as the son of a criminal by others!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On Christmas Day, Jasper went to look for Lawrence after school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Lawrence left the school gate, he was stopped by the driver of the Reed family and was taken to the car where Jasper was sitting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You...how did you come here?" Lawrence said in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Today is Christmas, and I got you a gift," Jasper said with a smile. Suddenly, his smile faded and he leaned in close to the person's cheek, furrowing his brow and asking, "Why do you have a bruise on your face?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence suddenly looked embarrassed, he had been... beaten by his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although it's not as popular as it was at the beginning, there are still some traces left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It...it was me accidentally hitting the door frame. It...it will be better in a few days," he stuttered, telling a lie in front of her, making him feel extremely guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I see. Well, be careful when you walk from now on," Jasper cautioned. He then took out his own gift, put on a smile again, and handed the gift over to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence looked at the gift in his hand with a slight surprise. The gift was wrapped nicely, even the wrapping paper on the outside was very beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well... but I didn't prepare your gift," he suddenly felt embarrassed. Actually... he did prepare it. He was still thinking about how to give her the gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, seeing her with such a beautifully wrapped gift, he suddenly felt a bit embarrassed to present his own gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My own gift seems too shabby compared to it.</p></div>
