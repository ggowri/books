        <h1>Chapter 811</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that his eyes were about to glance in her direction, Grace made a conscious attempt to avoid him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had ducked to one side, but she accidentally bumped into another man instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry!" She hastened to apologize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you f*cking blind? How dare you bump into me? Do you know who I am?" the man Grace hit said drunkenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to." All she could do now was apologize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, she could feel eyes on her. It was probably... his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He must have seen the mess I'm in right now.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A bitter and sour feeling spread in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the last bit of her dignity and pride were getting in the way. Even if they had broken up and even if he had seen her in an embarrassing state countless times... She still did not want him to see her embarrassment and confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her head seemed to have gotten dizzier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to get out of here as soon as she could.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the man she bumped into was not going to let her go that easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you really want to apologize, how about having a drink with me? I swear you've never tried such fine wine!" As he spoke, he tried to put his arm around Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace ducked sideways to avoid his hands. She knew he was a scoundrel, and it was no use apologizing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her priority now was to get out of here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her dodging irritated him, so the man lifted his foot and kicked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stumbled onto the ground and felt a pain in her left waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"F*ck you! I want you to drink with me because I respect you. How dare you dodge me? Why? Do you despise me? I'm going to teach you a lesson today and make you understand!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, the man raised his hand and was about to hit Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was already slow because she was drunk and was even kicked earlier. She could not avoid him if she wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His palm was about to fall on her body, but in the next moment, the man let out a blood-curdling shriek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly as the man's hand was stopped by another. It was a beautiful, clean hand that she knew very well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's... Jason's hand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did he... save me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let go. Do you know who I..." Before the drunk man could finish, there was a clattering noise that came from bones dislocating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then came the man's more violent cries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of the customers around the club were now looking in their direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a flick of his hands, Jason threw the drunk man to Terrence who was following behind him. He then walked up to Grace and asked, "Are you alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared blankly at him. It was not a hallucination caused by her drunken state. He was really in front of her and was so close too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only his eyes, which had always looked at her gently, were now endlessly dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... alright. Thank you," she said dryly, struggling to get up.</p></div>
