        <h1>Chapter 1141</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella breathed a sigh of relief. She was still applying makeup at 4:12 p.m.! She had a lot of witnesses!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who moved the surveillance camera?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're going to have to look into that to see if anyone on the scene noticed anybody moving the camera. However, I'm afraid it's going to take a long time. We have to see if we can get in touch with those people who were in the lounge area of the mall at that time and see if they noticed anything," said the police. Then, he continued to talk about Robert Brewer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">According to Robert Brewer's statement, he came to see Stella that day and Stella asked him to wait in the lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Robert Brewer felt uncomfortable after about ten minutes, and then he had no memory of what happened afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The hospital's laboratory results had also come in. Robert Brewer was indeed drugged with an aphrodisiac drug that day. However, the drug was easy to buy online, so it was difficult to track its source.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police said that they would continue to pursue the investigation, but it was difficult to come up with the results in a short time with the existing clues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella immediately felt relieved when she heard this! As long as they could not find out the truth any time soon, nothing more could be done as time went on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they came out of the police station, Stella said to Grace, "Grace, I think the police will find out who did it. I don't know who's trying to hurt me! You even suffered for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I want to find out who did it soon," Grace said pointedly before turning to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stepped forward and said, "I'll send you home!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks, I'll take the bus," said Grace. She was aware of Brian's feelings for her, so if she had no intention of reciprocating them, she would avoid him even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella leaned in and gently said to Brian, "Brian, let's go then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian looked at Grace's back and told the driver, "Take Miss Lindsay home." With that, he quickly ran in the direction Grace had left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella clenched her teeth in hatred and turned to get into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her former in-laws stopped her. "Stella... Dazhu is in the hospital right now. He... Because of this incident, the doctor said that the drug is too harmful to the body and will affect that function. You know that he has no children. We have to cure him, but it costs a lot of money. Can you give us some money so that Dazhu can undergo treatment?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella snorted coldly. "I don't have the money!" Without waiting for her former in-laws to react, she got in the car and let the driver drive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hated Robert Brewer for blackmailing her with those photos. Robert Brewer could not even tackle Grace. He was so useless and even made the film crew see her photos. She was so humiliated!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would rather Robert Brewer become infertile! It would be a relief to her hatred! How could she possibly spend money to save him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove away, and Robert Brewer's parents could only stare blankly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bus station was near the police station, and it was only a few minutes&rsquo; walk. When Grace was just about to reach the bus station, the bus she was going to take just happened to pull over. Grace quickly jogged a little and got on the bus. Just as she had finished tapping her monthly travel pass onto the scanner, there was the sound of rapid footsteps behind her and a figure got on the bus.</p></div>
