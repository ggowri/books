        <h1>Chapter 1444</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was taken aback and said, "Okay, I'll come to the hospital right away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace." Martin Weiss's voice rang out again. It was deep and husky. "I... seldom beg others, but I&rsquo;m begging you with everything I have and my life to persuade Kyla to accept my liver. Do whatever it takes to get her to agree to a transplant!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help being a little stunned. Having met Martin Weiss, she knew how difficult it was for a man with such a personality to say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Martin Weiss was really desperate now that Kyla&rsquo;s life was at stake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If Kyla died, then Martin Weiss... would really be in hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Got it," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter?" Jason asked when she ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kyla is in the hospital. The doctor said she needs a liver transplant now. Otherwise, it&rsquo;ll be too late and there won't be another chance." Grace rose to her feet as she said that. "I'm going to the hospital to persuade Kyla to agree to have the operation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then I'll go with you," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Your work..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll deal with those documents later. I can&rsquo;t rest assured if you go to the hospital alone,&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I have a bodyguard following me. What's there to worry about?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even so, I&rsquo;ll still be worried,&rdquo; he muttered. He had even thought of buying an island and bringing her there so that she could not go anywhere. Perhaps he would feel more at ease then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Jason and Grace got to the hospital, they saw Martin Weiss sitting on the long bench outside the ward, looking dejected. His head was lowered, and his hands were clutching his hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How is Kyla doing?" Grace quickly asked as she ran over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly looked up at Grace. When Grace saw Martin Weiss's expression at the moment, she felt a sudden shock in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was a look filled with agonizing grief and despair. Even though she had seen Martin Weiss's agonized and regretful look, it had never been so... intense and profound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss said dryly, "Kyla's inside, and so are Nelson and her mother. Grace, I beg you. Please do whatever it takes to make her accept my liver. I'll do anything as long as she's willing to have this operation!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at the way Martin Weiss was now, Grace was mad and sad. However, she could not criticize him and only said, "I'll go and check on Kyla first. I'll persuade her to have the operation!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that, Grace spoke to Jason and went into the ward. Meanwhile, Jason stayed outside and looked at Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Somehow, he kept seeing himself in Martin Weiss recently. It was as if his future would be like Martin Weiss's!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'No... No. Grace and I won't turn out like Martin Weiss and Kyla Corbyn. I'm just overthinking it!' Jason kept convincing himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the ward, Grace looked at Kyla Corbyn who had already woken up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn was probably not in pain anymore. Although she looked pale and still had the drip attached to the back of her hand, she was in good spirits. Mrs. Corbyn and Nelson were sitting at the head of the bed talking to her.</p></div>
