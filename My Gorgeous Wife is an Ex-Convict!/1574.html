        <h1>Chapter 1572</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina could not help but sigh. "You noticed it? I thought I was covering it up pretty well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I could kind of tell that you had something on your mind," said Grace. Her best friend had sounded a little... too happy on the phone and during video calls in the last two days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sometimes, the happier Lina seemed, the more she had on her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? What's going on?" Grace asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina stopped hiding and said, "I met Hadwin Stephenson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You went to see him?" Grace was surprised. She also knew that Hadwin Stephenson had come to Emerald City two days ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He appeared in front of me. I don't know whether it was a coincidence, so I'm a little confused too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't worry. I know that it's impossible between us. I won't let myself get caught up in it," Lina said. She got rid of the look of sadness on her face and said, "Oh, didn't you say you're going to a banquet with Jason in two days and you have no idea what to wear? There's a luxury boutique nearby. Let's go and have a look. Maybe we can find the right gown for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They went to the boutique. Grace took a look. The gowns here were indeed expensive, but since it was the first banquet she would be attending after returning to the Reed family, she had to pay extra attention to her gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, she was not only representing herself but also the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They looked around the gown boutique. They were both dressed in plain clothes without any designer items. When Grace picked out a silver gown, the sales assistant following them around said, "Sorry ladies, this is a display in our boutique and we don't provide fittings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace frowned as if she had figured out something. Just then, another sales assistant took the gown down and walked toward a female guest on the other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina immediately said, "What does that mean? I thought it was a display item and no fittings are allowed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That lady is a VIP customer here, so she can try it on even if it's a display item," the sales assistant said coldly. She did not think Grace and Lina had much spending power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She just thought it was a waste of time to serve them. Moreover, Miss Lynch had made an appointment with her and was going to come to the boutique later. Miss Lynch was the important customer she wanted to serve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, the sales assistant could not wait to get rid of Grace and Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Aren't you being opportunistic? It's customer discrimination!" snapped Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the sales assistant spoke confidently, "We only provide services to people who can afford the gowns here. If you become our boutique's VIP customers, then you can also try on these display items."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Lina wanted to swear. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace calmed her best friend and then said, "Please get your manager over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Are you trying to make a complaint?" she asked somewhat disdainfully. She hated people who pretended they were rich when they had no money! She was not afraid of such complaints anyway. She had an important customer like Miss Lynch. Even the manager had to be polite to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All she had to do was to tell the manager that she had to serve Miss Lynch later. The manager would probably have nothing to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was ten minutes later when the manager walked up to Grace and Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
