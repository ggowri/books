        <h1>Chapter 1776</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As for when they could see Mason... "Mason will return to the Reed family when he&rsquo;s discharged. You'll get to meet him then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, I'll be a good older sister!" said Jasper as she lifted her chin, already assuming the role of an older sister!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, William, who had been silent, suddenly said, "Is my mommy going to jail?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The air seemed a little depressing when the childlike voice was heard asking such a question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at the child in front of her. She and Lily had a lot of bad blood, but the child was innocent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's for the judge to decide," said Grace. She could not bear to say the harsh truth so directly in front of the children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oh," William replied in a whisper as he lowered his head and said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said to Grace, "Alright, it's almost time for you to go back to the hospital. You've been out too long. There's too much missing data on your hands. The calculation is going to be inaccurate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," said Grace. She bid goodbye to the two children before her eyes rested on William for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After getting into the car, Jason asked, "What's the matter? Are you thinking about that child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I&rsquo;m not. I just feel sorry for the child. Lily is going to prison, and we don't know who's going to raise him. He has a great talent for music. It would be a pity if it gets buried because of his circumstances," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Generally speaking, the child will be raised by Lily's parents. As for his biological father..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "It isn't Sean. William's biological father isn't Sean. Lily made it clear on the phone when I was on the hill. She deliberately made Sean think that he was William's biological father," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It doesn't matter who the father is. It's just a child. Once the key arrives and the handcuffs are off, I'll hand the child to the police and let them take care of him," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How is the Atkinson family doing now?" asked Grace. She had not heard of the Atkinson family since returning to Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The Atkinson family went bankrupt. Harold Atkinson and his wife are in a lot of debt and have left Emerald City. I don't keep tabs on them anymore, but the police will find them if they want to hand the child to them," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace sighed, fearing it might not be a good thing for Harold Atkinson and his wife to raise William. However, it was the Atkinson family's family matters, after all. She did not want to bother herself with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Back in the hospital, Grace had dinner and soon fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stared at her sleeping face as he looked down slightly. "I'm going home to deal with some things first. I'll come and accompany you later. Don't worry, I won't let our children encounter any more danger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason got up, walked out of the ward, and got into a car parked at the hospital&rsquo;s entrance. "Go back to Reed Residence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Uncle Kwan was a little surprised to see Jason back in Reed Residence. After all, Young Madam was hospitalized. Judging from how much Young master Reed cared about Young Madam, he should be in the hospital taking care of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Where's Jasper?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Little Young Lady and William are in Little Young Lady's bedroom. They're probably going to bed soon," said Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason walked toward his daughter's bedroom.</p></div>
