        <h1>Chapter 3264</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since Mrs. Hart is here, I'll leave first." Maggie smiled awkwardly and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at Brian and asked, "She is Maggie, right? What did she talk to you about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Her name is Maggie?" Brian casually replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't you know who she is?" This time, Valda was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why should I know who she is?" Brian asked back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But... she has acted in several TV dramas, and except for one, she was the lead in all of them," she said. Although these TV dramas were not blockbusters, they were generally good and above average.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what? She's only played the lead role a few times," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was speechless. Although he was the prince of the entertainment industry, there were too many big shots in the industry. Compared to those big shots, Maggie seemed to be incomparable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you don't know her, then what were you two talking about just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She probably wanted to say something to me, but I wasn't interested in listening to her. I just told her that I don't know her and don't want to talk to her," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda finally understood why Maggie looked embarrassed just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them then went to the blood drawing area. Since becoming pregnant, Valda had to have her blood drawn every few days. Her blood vessels were already thin, so it was difficult to draw blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During this time, with the frequent blood draws, there were always faint bruises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After drawing blood again, Brian held a cotton ball for Valda, looking guilty and distressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was Valda who comforted her husband instead, "What's wrong? I'm not in pain. You look like I've suffered a lot. What if I go into the delivery room to give birth? Are you going to hit the wall or faint?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's words seemed to remind Brian of something, and his face turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, he only thought about wanting to have a child with his partner, but forgot to consider the risks during childbirth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just think, Grace, Lina, and Kyla all went through life-threatening experiences when giving birth. What if Valda goes through the same thing in the future...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian couldn't bear to think about it anymore. If that were really the case, he would rather they never have children between them, ever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong with you? Don't scare me!" Valda looked at Brian's face, which suddenly turned pale, and hurriedly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's lips trembled, "Sorry, Valda!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you apologizing for? What's going on?" Valda looked confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian hugged Valda and said, "I forgot to think about the danger you might face when we have children in the future." However, he knew that he couldn't replace her in facing that danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If possible, he wishes he could bear the pain of childbirth for her and face the danger instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Until now, Valda finally understood why his face turned pale all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Every woman who gives birth will face danger, but it's a willing sacrifice! I'm willing to face this danger, and before facing it, I'll also be fully prepared," replied Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, because she loves him, she is willing to take this risk for their child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">***</p></div>
