        <h1>Chapter 3487</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she heard a muffled groan and the sound of someone falling down. The kidnapper who had been acting inappropriately towards her was now standing up, looking panicked, as a young boy was knocking down the other kidnappers who were attacking him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In just a short amount of time, even the kidnappers didn't have time to react before they were all knocked down to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Veronica felt a sharp tug on her body, followed by a cold sensation on her temple. "No... don't come any closer. If you come any closer, I'll blow this girl's head off!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Until this moment, a figure finally caught Veronica's eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's pupils suddenly contracted, and her face was filled with shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this real? Or is it an illusion?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In Mason's hand, there is currently a handgun, and all the other kidnappers, except for the one holding her hostage, are lying on the ground as if they have passed out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica remembers that Mason's former boxing coach once said that Mason is different from others. He always aims to knock down his opponent with the fewest moves possible, and he never hesitates to target the fatal areas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When people are fighting, they will intentionally avoid hitting certain areas that could cause serious harm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, since he doesn't know how to fight, it's most dangerous to get into a fight with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let her go!" Mason pointed his gun at the kidnapper who was holding Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, at this moment, two guns were pointed at two people, and the scene became tense and deadlocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You...put down the gun, otherwise, I'll shoot now. Even if I die, this girl will accompany me!" The other person shouted at Mason. Earlier, Lionel had shown them a photo of Mason and said that this Mason from the Reed family was very obsessed with this girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the girl's matter is considered more important than his own life, so he is now determined to gamble on whether the Reed family's Mason is really like what Lionel said!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason narrowed his eyes slightly, his cold expression making it difficult to discern what he was thinking at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time passes by second by second, and for this kidnapper, every minute is an excruciating experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Throw away the gun, or else I'll really shoot!" the kidnapper impatiently shouted, appearing extremely agitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I'll throw it!" said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't do it!" Veronica shouted anxiously. If he really threw away the gun, it would mean that both of their lives would be at the mercy of the armed kidnapper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, are you still mad at me?" Mason suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What time is it? He's still asking this! Veronica's nose suddenly felt sour and her eyes became wet. "I'm not angry anymore. I'm not mad at you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She choked up and said that she only hoped that both of them could be safe now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm happy as long as Veronica isn't mad at me. I won't let anything happen to her, I'll protect you." A smile spread across his face, and as he finished speaking, he threw his gun to the ground.</p></div>
