        <h1>Chapter 450</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Hadwin did this and told her about it, she praised Hadwin highly. Of course, after praising him, Hadwin took advantage of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of this, being taken advantage of by Hadwin did not disgust her. Instead, she kind of enjoyed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina once analyzed herself for a long time to figure out why she behaved that way. She finally concluded that maybe it was because of Hadwin's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, his looks were her cup of tea. She was so appearance-obsessed that it was hard for her not to be affected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People were visual animals after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The vibe of the two men looking at each other outside the car was not as harmonious as that of the two women on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect you to go with us today, Young Master Reed," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace is my girlfriend. Of course, I'm going when it concerns her," Jason replied lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? It seems that the person who died in Grace's case was your fianc&eacute;e, Jennifer Atkinson, Young Master Reed. Do you believe Grace to be guilty or innocent?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes suddenly turned cold. His gaze was piercing Hadwin fiercely like sharp ice swords. "I will do justice to her." Of course, he would not let the people who wanted to hurt her off the hook.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" Hadwin smiled a little and did not ask again. After all, he was only an outsider in Grace's case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What made him a little curious was now that Jason was with Grace, it was a bit strange that he was not helping Grace reverse her case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it because of the Atkinson family? After all, Jennifer Atkinson was killed in the car accident. Besides, the Reed family and the Atkinson family shared a good relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn&rsquo;t expect you to help my girlfriend in investigating her case, Mr. Stephenson. I should thank you for that." Jason smirked, and the cold seemed to melt all of a sudden, just like the warm spring sun. "Do you want to get in the car? If there's any further delay, I'm afraid we'll have to postpone our arrival time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, let's get in the car," said Hadwin. He had only gotten in touch with Jason once when Jason took Grace to his mansion to take Lina away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They said Jason was temperamental and it was hard to guess what he was thinking about. He controlled the vast Reed Group and ruled Emerald City, but few people knew what he liked and disliked. Even before Grace, Jennifer Atkinson was the only woman who was linked to his name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that other women who tried to get close to Jason were all met with devastating ends. He did not know what men like Jason saw in Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In his opinion, Grace was just an ordinary woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Hadwin thought of this, he suddenly touched his nose and could not help laughing at himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He went mad for more than three years and went all over the world looking for an ordinary woman like Lina. He even went back and forth to the places they had been to together countless times, just like a fool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, he had finally found this heartless woman!</p></div>
