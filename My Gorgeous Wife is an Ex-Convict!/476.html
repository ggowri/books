        <h1>Chapter 475</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the man would not tolerate anyone talking bad about Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay's heart could not help but tinge with envy. Stella Lindsay was jealous that Grace was able to find such a handsome boyfriend who did not care about her imprisonment. On her end, she had married a blacksmith when she was young.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay had thought that the blacksmith she married was at the very least skilled. Additionally, he did pay a substantial bride price. However, throughout the past few years, Stella Lindsay had begun feeling more and more miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The friends she used to go out with now all living good lives in the city, marrying white-collar workers, civil servants, directors, and alike. They sounded so high-class that Stella Lindsay was embarrassed to say that her husband was merely a blacksmith.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had often wondered in recent years that if she had not married so early, would she have been married in town now? At the very least, she would be married to a white-collar worker!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, so this is Grace's boyfriend," said Third Aunt as she interposed with a tone of earnest concern. "You must cherish him. Tell me, what did that rich and powerful man earlier see in you? Didn't he find you interesting at first but then dump you when he came around?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at Grace. "A rich and powerful man? Who is she talking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Grace guessed that Third Aunt was referring Jason. After all, he had made such a fuss about coming into town and saving her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, at that time, it was First Uncle and Second Uncle that had been in simpleton Feng's house, and Third Aunt was not there. Thus, she had never met Jason before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, Grace then heard Third Aunt&rsquo;s elaborate explanation, "Well, when Grace was here, there was a rich and powerful man who brought a lot of people to pick her up. They brought a lot of fancy cars. I was worried about Grace. I was afraid that a rich and powerful man like him would not have any true feelings for her and that she'd get caught up in it. I'm glad that she has a boyfriend like you now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found it funny. Third Aunt and her cousin were indeed the same! They both liked to reveal matters related to her on purpose. However, what Third Aunt did not know was that the rich and powerful man she was talking about was standing right in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? You're very thoughtful," Jason said lightly as he affectionately put an arm around Grace's shoulders. He leaned closer to her and said with his fragrant breath that smelled like an orchid, "Are you caught up in our relationship?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but glare at Jason. He knew that Third Aunt was talking about him and deliberately asked Grace that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Putting that aside, was he aware of how intimate they looked at the moment?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop fooling around," Grace muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not fooling around, I'm serious," replied Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blushed a little and could only whisper, "We'll talk about it... when we get back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. We'll talk about it when we get back," Jason said with a laugh. When Jason looked at Grace, his eyes seemed soft as if he were doting on her. On the contrary, Jason&rsquo;s eyes looked rather cold whenever he looked at the other two women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It has to be said that Stella Lindsay along with Third Aunt, who was quite old, found the scene before them blinding. However, they could only call the two shameless in their hearts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Stella Lindsay, her envy grew even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did the man really not care about Grace's past? Or was he so deep in love with Grace that he was able to ignore her past?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, can I call you Jason too? I'm Grace's cousin. You can call me Stella," Stella Lindsay took the initiative to introduce herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, you can call me 'Mr. Jay'," replied Jason. As for what he would call Stella Lindsay, he had no intention of addressing her. Thus, he did not care about what she said afterward.</p></div>
