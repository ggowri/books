        <h1>Chapter 3382</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knows how devastated his wife is right now, and he cannot let Valda lose all hope under any circumstances!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, you go rest for a bit. If you don't take a good rest, how can you stay strong until Harley wakes up?" Brian said as he wiped away Valda's tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda shook her head and said, "I can't rest at all. Every time I close my eyes, I see that explosion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound of the explosion lingers in my ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian lowered his gaze and held the person in his arms tighter. "Valda, no matter what difficulties we may face in the future, we will face them together, okay? You must never leave me behind, do you understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's body stiffened slightly, sensing that Brian's body was trembling at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She closed her eyes, and the tears that had stopped started to flow again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew what he was worried about. This man loves her so much that he worries a lot. He worries not only about their daughter but also about her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For her, this explosion was unbearable pain. But for him, it was no different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda raised her hand and slowly wrapped it around Brian, reciprocating the love of this man who loved her deeply. "Brian, I will never abandon you! No matter what happens!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She will persevere not just for Harley, but also for Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley's incident has become widely known among the major families in Emerald City, including the Reed, Stephenson, Weiss, Barlow, and Gregory families, who are all trying to find ways to help him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The current situation calls for waiting, we must wait for 72 hours to see how things develop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was crying uncontrollably because this amusement park was the one she had mentioned to Harley before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The four children of the Reed family, Veronica, Nelson, and Trista, have all visited Harley in the hospital. However, the adults have not told them that the first 72 hours are crucial in determining whether Harley will wake up or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So the children all thought that Harley would eventually wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler, who accompanied Tina, learned that if Harley does not wake up within 72 hours, the chances of becoming a vegetable will greatly increase.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe I'll never wake up in this lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he didn't dare to mention a word of it to Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now Tina is already feeling enough self-blame. If she were to find out the truth, who knows what would happen!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, even Chandler who usually doesn't like to meddle in other people's affairs, is desperately hoping that Harley can wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Harley doesn't wake up, Tina might feel guilty for the rest of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However... the situation with Harley is indeed tricky!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon this realization, after leaving the hospital, Chandler did not accompany Tina back to the Stephenson family. Instead, he rode in a car and arrived at another hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This hospital may not have a prominent reputation, but those who are able to enter it are all elites in the medical field.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But only a very small number of people know that the owner behind this hospital is the Quentin family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Lornell is boredly watching the news on the hospital TV screen while lying in his sickbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There is also news about the amusement park explosion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person responsible for causing the explosion was an employee of the amusement park. They had a grudge against the park due to a salary dispute, which led them to intentionally cause the explosion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How boring!" Lornell thought to himself. The explosion almost killed him, but it turned out to be just a revenge attack over a wage dispute, not an assassination attempt against the Quentin family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, actually, before the news was broadcasted on TV, Lornell had already learned the truth about the explosion from the Quentin family's side!</p></div>
