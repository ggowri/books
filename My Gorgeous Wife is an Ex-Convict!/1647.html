        <h1>Chapter 1645</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Well... she said Grace and her mentor are having some sort of illicit relationship. I have no idea how she managed to tap into those silly videos with my phone. Grace and her mentor won't be in such a relationship, of course. It&rsquo;s mostly rumors online. They said something about Mr. Watts being too nice to Grace, even losing the case to Grace to elevate Grace's status in the legal community..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch seemed to be explaining and defending Grace, but she was actually relaying some awful online rumors to Jason as though she was afraid he would not know about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You seem to know quite a lot." Jason snorted with a half-smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I care about Grace. After all, the Reed family has always helped Oriel and me. I consider myself a part of the Reed family too," Irene Lynch turned to look at Grace as she spoke, "But seriously, I think you should stay away from your friend Lina for a while, Grace. After all, people will think she's a bad influence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at Irene Lynch coldly. "You have no right to criticize my friends and me. Also, I don't know you that well so I&rsquo;d prefer it if you don&rsquo;t call me Grace. I think you'd better call me Mrs. Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch instantly pretended to look aggrieved. "I'm just worried about you. You mentioned all for one and one for all in the kindergarten this afternoon. Haven't you thought about how much harm you'll bring to the Reed family if you continue to associate yourself with Lina?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Everyone knows Lina is a homewrecker. Even five-year-old children who watch the news know about it. Though nothing is going on between you and your mentor, others will think you and your friend are the same!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's more, Lina is a woman who deliberately destroyed others&rsquo; relationships. Hadwin Stephenson was supposed to get married! Listen, Lina is a vain snob. She broke up with Hadwin Stephenson when he was at his lowest. Now that Hadwin Stephenson is successful, she can&rsquo;t give up those riches and honor, so she deliberately seduced&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A loud slap cut Irene Lynch off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch covered her face and looked at Grace in disbelief. She did not expect her to suddenly slap her, much less in front of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said coldly, "You have no right to criticize what kind of person Lina is! I'll slap you again if I hear you gossip about Lina!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace spoke maliciously, her almond-shaped eyes full of determination and ferocity!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch 's heart trembled but she still retorted, "I'm just looking out for the Reed family. If you continue to associate yourself with women like Lina, then the entire Reed family will be disgraced&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Another slap to Irene Lynch's face interrupted the rest of her speech.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I told you, I'll slap you again if I hear you gossip about her!" Grace said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch's eyes quickly became filled with tears, and she looked at Jason with red eyes. "Mr. Reed, I... I'm just looking out for the Reed family. Maybe Mrs. Reed's affection for the Reed family has weakened after she left for five years. But I... I regard the Reed family as my own. I don't want the Reed family to be criticized."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch looked utterly pitiful as she put on a tearful appearance with her red and swollen cheeks!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's thin lips parted gently. "Does it hurt?" There was a touch of tenderness in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was delighted. She knew men liked women who were weak and delicate. Now that Grace was being so arrogant, it was a sharp contrast to her pitiful appearance. After all, she was only looking out for the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, her heart soon sank because Jason had walked up to Grace. He took her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'He's... asking the one who slapped me if her hands hurt?'</p></div>
