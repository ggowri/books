        <h1>Chapter 1287</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just too much trouble. Wouldn't it be much easier if you ask Master Reed to talk to the police?" Melinda Riley said as she continued to swallow her pride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not going to help someone who wanted to hurt me. Besides, my mother had only one daughter. I don't have any sisters," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Melinda Riley immediately got mad. "What... What are you talking about? You're getting even, aren't you? You're getting back at your family for not helping you when you were in prison, aren't you? But why don't you think about the difficulty we're in? Having been imprisoned yourself, are you going to let your sister suffer the same fate?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sarcastically said, "You're already so worried when Evelyn hasn't even been imprisoned yet. But why did you choose to do nothing when I was imprisoned? How dare you say I'm trying to get even? If Evelyn hasn't done anything illegal, no one can do anything to her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You offended the Stevens family and the Yi..." Melinda Riley swallowed the words after catching a glimpse of Jason's expression that had suddenly sunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The look in Jason's eyes made her feel that he was going to kill her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason walked up to Melinda Riley and said in a cold voice, "So you're not afraid of offending me now, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Melinda Riley only felt a chill rising from the soles of her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Evelyn is lucky to be judged by the law. If you disturb Grace again, you can accompany your daughter in prison," Jason warned coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Jason was about to turn around, Tony Cummins suddenly said, "Master Reed, didn't... Didn't we all think Grace was the killer back then? Master Reed, you didn't think Grace was wronged when the court ruled that too, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason froze. He only heard Tony Cummins continue saying, "We... We just did the same thing as you, Master Reed. Grace can forgive you and be with you, but she's unwilling to reconcile with us, her family. Isn't that too unreasonable?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the twinkling of an eye, he turned his head around. Those dark and deep beautiful eyes had a terrible ferocity in them. "What... did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins only felt that Jason&rsquo;s eyes were full of intense killing intent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason&rsquo;s hand reached out and grabbed Tony Cummins by the neck, preventing him from saying another word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone around was taken aback by Jason's actions. Melinda Riley&rsquo;s legs even became weak as she yelled, "He's... He's killing..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd tried to pull Jason and Tony Cummins apart, but Jason's hand was clenched around the other man so tightly and he did not loosen his fingers at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins only found it harder and harder to breathe. The way Jason's eyes stared at him now made him feel that the man in front of him really wanted him to die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he had said something that made him deserve to die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, although his words had been a little harsh to the ears, it was nothing too serious... Tony Cummins's face grew pale. Even the whites of his eyes were starting to show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurried forward, grabbed his wrist, and shouted, "Jay, don't do that! I don't care what he says..."</p></div>
