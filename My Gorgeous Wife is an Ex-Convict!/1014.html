        <h1>Chapter 1013</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that Dr. Russell was indeed as capable as Brian said!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her replies of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; were imprinted in Brian's heart, and it seemed to be setting off waves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What else has she suffered? Her nails were pulled out, and her fingers were broken... Who did these?' He even felt the urge to kill!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a grave face, Dr. Russell felt every bone of Grace's fingers. After a long while, he said, "Come, let's take an X-ray. I need to see how your fingers are doing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Grace saw a screening isolation room that did not match the small clinic at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they finished taking the X-ray, Dr. Russell examined the film carefully and was deep in thought for a long time. He said to Grace, "You didn't get proper treatment after you injured your fingers. You've missed the golden period of treatment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know," said Grace. The specialist Jason found for her also said the same thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell said, "Your fingers probably hurt whenever it gets cold and humid. It must be difficult for you to complete certain delicate movements. However, there&rsquo;s still something we can do for your fingers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. "Can they be cured?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you follow the hospital's treatment, it may only help you relieve the pain during the cold and humid weather at best. However, if I were to treat you, I can improve your fingers' flexibility. At least your fingers will be able to move normally when doing some daily activities like writing and holding chopsticks. However, the process might be more painful and we can't use anesthesia. You can think about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not expect to be able to receive further treatment for her fingers. She thought her hands would be like that forever. "It's alright, I can live with the pain," she said. Perhaps the best thing about her three years in prison was that she had become more tolerant of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's great. Then you can come here every seven days. You can decide when to come next time, and I&rsquo;ll prepare the tools," said Dr. Russell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How much does the treatment cost?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell gave Brian a strange look. "What's the matter? What&rsquo;s the relationship between this girl and you? You're not dating? Is she going to pay for it herself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're not dating, but I'm pursuing her," Brian said graciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell was surprised. "I never expected you to have such a day as well." Then, he looked at Grace and said, "Brian brought you here, so it's free."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I still have to pay for the treatment." Grace insisted. If the treatment was too expensive, she might have to save up some money for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Grace and said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Russell offered a price of 300 dollars for each treatment, and she had to come eight times to complete a course of treatment. It was only after that he would decide on the next course depending on the results.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was relieved that she could afford the treatment for now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they walked out of the clinic and back to Brian's car, Grace said, "Thank you for bringing me here today. I didn't have much hope of healing these hands."</p></div>
