        <h1>Chapter 2458</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It hurt again...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's hand instantly covered his heart. 'Why is my heart hurting again? How much do I love this woman that it&rsquo;s so painful even now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss hit his heart repeatedly as if to distract himself from the physical pain&hellip; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had no idea how long she slept, but she seemed to have a vague feeling that she was being watched in her sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she opened her eyes, she saw Martin Weiss sitting on the couch on one side of the ward. His dark eyes were staring straight at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shuddered and slowly propped herself up. "What... are you doing here?" She glanced out of the window and saw that it was still dark. It was obvious that it was not dawn yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He continued to stare at her in silence, his thin lips pressing together tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip uneasily. "If you're worried about the baby in my belly, I can promise you that I'll try my best to drag it out as long as possible. Unless the doctor says I have to have a C-section, I'm not going to give birth to them prematurely. I know that every day they stay inside my belly increases their chances of survival."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said that to reassure Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss's face grew more solemn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Doesn't this woman know that every day the baby is inside her increases the danger she'll be in?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, do you think I'll save you no matter what happens to you and that I'll take the risk for you no matter how dangerous it is for you to give birth to this baby?" Martin Weiss's voice rang in the silent ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him gently before shaking her head. "No, I&rsquo;ve never thought of it that way. Martin Weiss, you don't need to take any risks for me. I know it's risky to have this baby, but it's my choice, and I'll bear the consequences."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll bear the consequences?" He suddenly sneered as he got up from the couch and rushed to her hospital bed. "What kind of consequences do you think you can bear?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She realized that his eyes were scarlet red. "What happened to your eyes?" She reached out her hand to touch his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he grabbed her hand. "I'm asking you, how are you going to bear the consequences?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand gripped hers so hard that it hurt. It felt as though his hand was made out of steel. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla frowned with pain and tried to answer calmly, "With my life. My life is the only thing I can use to bear the consequences."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her statement made the pain in Martin Weiss&rsquo;s chest worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke so lightly of her life. Then... "What about your mother? And Nelson? Have you ever wondered what will happen to them if anything happens to you?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'And even... me! What will become of me if she&rsquo;s gone?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not utter the last sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know that... I have no choice but to take this bet. After all, the baby in my belly is still a human life," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Bet? What if you lose the bet? Are you going to leave your mother with two children to raise?" he asked sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've been keeping my mother's pension money all these years. I've also told Grace and Lina to help me take care of my mother if anything happens to me. As for the two children... I don't think you'll ignore them. Of course, my mother, Grace, and Lina will also help raise them if you refuse to raise them," said Kyla.</p></div>
