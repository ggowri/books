        <h1>Chapter 3162</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was stunned, then became a little flustered, "Why...why are you suddenly bringing this up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it sudden?" He chuckled self-deprecatingly. "Actually, it's not sudden at all. I've thought about this question a thousand times in my mind, and I've also thought about countless answers you might give me. It's just that tonight, I suddenly wanted to ask it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After pausing for a moment, he continued, "Kyla, I want to know your true thoughts, without any other factors, only based on your own heart. Do you...want to be with me, Martin, from now on and always?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he asked this question, there was a hint of nervousness in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, he is nervous, nervous about what her answer will be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla remained silent, slowly lowering her head, as if thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Martin stood by the bed, waiting for her answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time passed by, second by second, between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But after waiting for a long time, she still didn't say a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A bitter expression gradually spread across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps he shouldn't have asked this question, shouldn't have disrupted the current balance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's just forget I said anything. You go ahead and sleep, I'll go wash up," he said, turning to walk towards the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as he took a step, she suddenly grabbed his hand and said, "Wait!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body stiffened, and his footsteps came to a halt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt her warmth in the palm of his hand, and her voice ignited hope in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Martin, I also want to be with you from now on," Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin turned to look at her, "Have you thought it through?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I have," she lifted her head to meet his gaze, "I used to give up on you and think of many reasons not to be with you. I even thought that we would never have a result if we kept entangling like this. But now, my thoughts have changed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking a deep breath, she continued, "I think maybe it's Valda and Brian's experience that made me realize that the person I love is still alive in this world, and that's such a beautiful thing. Valda survived, but for Brian, it was also his survival. If Valda really died, Brian would only live a life worse than death, wouldn't he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Kyla spoke, she raised a hand and gently stroked Martin's cheek, "So, after experiencing death, we can still live like this. Martin, I don't want to waste the time we have left. I want to cherish every day we have together. This way, even on the day we die, we won't have any regrets."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words flowed like a gentle stream into his ears, and he felt something surging in his chest, spreading throughout his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And her hand, touching his cheek, made him cherish this warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is... her warmth!</p></div>
