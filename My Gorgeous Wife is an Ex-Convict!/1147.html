        <h1>Chapter 1146</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Stella's eyes suddenly lit up. "Do you have a way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I wouldn't have come to you if I don't. You want to be Mrs. Hart, don't you? Unfortunately, Brian is now in love with Grace. You probably won't stand a chance!" said Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was no fool. She immediately asked, "Why would you help me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Money. I want money, and Grace has long been a problem for me," said Evelyn. If it were not for Grace, how would she and her parents have ended up the way they were now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her parents had left Emerald City to work in other cities to make a living, while she remained here to do odd jobs. Even her cleaning job was not a full-time job as she was just a temporary substitute for an employee who was on sick leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect such a coincidence to have met Stella and be &lsquo;bribed&rsquo; by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella frowned. After all, she had just been blackmailed by Robert Brewer earlier. Was she about to be blackmailed by Evelyn again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you want to take advantage without putting in any effort?" Evelyn looked at her with a sneer. "I'll get rid of Grace with you. I'll get the money, and you'll get the man. Isn't that nice? Without Grace, you'll have a better chance of marrying into the Hart family. After all..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn suddenly drawled her voice, and the sneer in her eyes grew. "You're the one Brian has been looking for. You&rsquo;ve taken Grace's place. You don't want Brian to find out about this one day, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella suddenly stiffened at this, and her eyes looked almost in horror at Evelyn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know what you're talking about!" However, there was a distinct gloominess in her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn sneered, "You don't know? Do you think you're the real deal after impersonating her for so long? Do I have to be more explicit? The person Brian has been looking for is Grace! I've seen Grace wearing the small silver bracelet that Brian wears all the time, and they&rsquo;re a pair. However, she lost one of the silver bracelets later, and the missing silver bracelet is with Brian now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's back and palms were already covered with cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea that except for herself and Grace, there was a third person who knew about this&mdash;Evelyn!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, I just want money!" Evelyn put on a gentle smile and tapped Stella on the shoulder. "Otherwise, I would've told Brian the truth a long time ago, wouldn't I? You can only be at ease after you get rid of Grace. Otherwise, you'll be frightened every day that Grace exists!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Evelyn had no intention of staying any longer and left Stella's apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella suddenly collapsed, leaning against the wall and not knowing what to do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Should I trust Evelyn? Should I trust that I can get rid of Evelyn with money?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Evelyn was right about one thing. If she did not get rid of Grace, she would never be the mistress of the Hart family. She would live in fear every day that Grace might one day tell Brian the truth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore... She must not allow Grace to stay around Brian any longer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p></div>
