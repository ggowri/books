        <h1>Chapter 1898</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the workshop in Emerald City&rsquo;s prison, Secretary Wang worked mechanically with a vague smile</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Young Master would find Grace unworthy of his love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once Young Master was utterly disappointed in Grace, she would no longer be his weakness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The Reed family would then grow stronger under Young Master.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Master, you remember, right? You remember that Grace fell into the sea to escape you..." murmured Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he was trying so hard to hypnotize Young Master, he had also changed that part of his memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He got the hypnotist to hint to the hypnotized Young Master that Grace fell into the sea just to escape him. If Young Master ever tried to reverse the hypnosis to recall the past, his memory would be tampered with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Young Master would only be left with the false memory when that happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would fulfill Old Master's last wishes&mdash;making sure Young Master had no weaknesses and ensuring that the Reed family would grow stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That was his purpose in staying alive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's heartbeat quickened as she arrived at Splashes of Blood. She did not have a good impression of the room, and she still remembered the suffocating sense of depression in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace knocked gently on the door, but there was no noise from inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She bit her lip slightly and pushed the door open, only to see Jason standing inside. The shelf in front of him still contained the long sword stained with blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay," muttered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What are you doing here? I thought I made it clear to you just now," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace explained, "You said you recovered your memory, but the truth isn't like that at all! Jay, your memories aren't real. I didn't fall into the sea to escape you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace then explained why and how she fell into the sea to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What happened back then was a thorn in her heart. Speaking about it was tantamount to recalling it all over again, and it made her feel uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Jason's expression remained unchanged after hearing what she said. "So, you chose to fall into the sea because you loved me and didn't want me to die?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She replied with a hum.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then why didn't you say anything before? Haven't you always told me that you don't remember why you fell into the sea? Didn't you say you lost your memory?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well... I did lose my memory at the beginning and didn't remember. Terrence told me about it at first," said Grace as she apologized to Terrence in her heart. She... sold him out by accident.</p></div>
