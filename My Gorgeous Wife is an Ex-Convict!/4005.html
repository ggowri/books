        <h1>Chapter 4003</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Haha, you finally came. I've been waiting for so long," Irene said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Irene, state your conditions!" Mick stepped forward and spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had originally thought that Irene was just a greedy person who was not important, but he had not expected her to have the courage to do such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Conditions? Mick, are you coming to negotiate conditions with me now? How did you treat me when I begged you to let me get close to you before?" Irene questioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick said in a deep voice, "I didn't want any emotional closeness with you, but as long as you don't harm the two of them, the Reed family can try to satisfy any conditions you have."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" Irene said maliciously. "Then I want you to kneel down and apologize to me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's face became even colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene sneered, "What, you don't want to? If you don't, then I can push one of them into the sea at any time, or maybe both!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After seeing the Reed family's faces change, Irene continued, "Also, don't even think about rushing over here. I've buried a lot of detonation wires around here. If you rush over, you might just get blown up by a bomb!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family and William's faces all darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick said, "Just me kneeling and kowtowing isn't enough for you to let them go, is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course there's more. I want you to give me a car and transfer 1 billion dollars to a designated account. And as I told you before, don't call the police. You should have followed that, right? If not, then I'll just die with them. I won't lose anything!" Irene said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fine, I'll kneel!" Mick tightly pursed his lips and knelt straight towards Irene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Big brother!" Jasper's eyes were about to split as he shouted loudly. How could Irene humiliate his big brother like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could she!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, don't worry. Big brother won't let anything happen to you," Mick looked at his sister and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the corner of his eye glanced at Nancy, who was pale beside Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clearly, he should be worried about Jasper now, but why...he also worried about Nancy, worried that something might happen to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace looked at her son kneeling like this and shouted at Irene, "Let me kneel instead. If you want to hate the Reed family, you should hate me more, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course I hate you. You're the high and mighty Mrs. Reed. If you hadn't brought your daughter back, I wouldn't have lost everything. How about this, you slap yourself until I'm satisfied!" Irene said maliciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace didn't hesitate at all and was about to raise her hand to slap herself. At this point, no matter what Irene said, she would agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They needed to stall for time until the undercover police officers could come up with a safe plan to rescue the hostages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene's hand was about to hit Grace's face when Jason caught her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Irene, don't push your luck. No one dares to hurt my wife! If you dare to make such demands again, I'll make sure you never leave Emerald City!" Jason threatened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene shuddered at the chilling tone of his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back in the Reed family, Jason was the person she feared the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This fear had become a psychological shadow after she was kicked out of the Reed family. Facing Jason's warning, Irene felt a sense of dread creeping up inside her.</p></div>
