        <h1>Chapter 2620</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Keith Sharp laughed dryly. "Do comic artists like you you come up with the plot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are comic artists who work with writers, but I come up with the plots for my comics," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it hard to come up with the plot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It depends on your inspiration. Sometimes, it's not that hard when you're inspired."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're uninspired, is it easier to get inspired by dating?" Keith Sharp asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not really. I just watch more films. Other people's comics and novels can also inspire me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille said you're thinking of a new comic theme right now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, we were discussing it for a long time today but haven't reached a conclusion," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland also complained, "I know, right? Oh, everything's difficult at the beginning. I'm miserable every time we have to decide on a theme and outline."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Theller, will you get inspired if you have a boyfriend?" Keith Sharp glanced at Raymond Bowman out of the corner of his eye when he said this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's expression remained unchanged as if he was only casually listening to their conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what Valda Theller said next made Raymond Bowman's expression change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have a boyfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? You have a boyfriend?" Keith Sharp was shocked, but Camille Strickland hesitated slightly before saying somewhat ostentatiously, "Yes, Valda's taken!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland's words were directed at Raymond Bowman. After all, Raymond Bowman had embarrassed her best friend and made her the laughing stock at school back then. Now, it felt like they had gained an advantage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But didn't we agree on bringing a friend who doesn't have a boyfriend..." Keith Sharp cast an uneasy glance at Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it seemed to him that Raymond Bowman had deliberately set this up today to meet Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Camille Strickland could answer, Valda Theller said, "Sorry, Mr. Sharp. I took the initiative to ask Camille to bring me here because I wanted to see what kind of person her blind date was."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Keith Sharp gave a wry smile. It did not matter to him, but CEO Raymond Bowman...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have a boyfriend?" Raymond Bowman asked Valda Theller as he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller met his eyes and said, "Yes, I have a boyfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Impossible!" his thin lips said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was unhappy with that statement. "How could it be impossible? Valda has many pursuers. Raymond Bowman, you wouldn&rsquo;t think that Valda has no pursuers, would you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman suddenly got up, leaned over, and grabbed Valda Theller's wrist. "Do you really have a boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The burning gaze was suffocatingly pressuring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller frowned. "Raymond Bowman, let go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me. Do you really have a boyfriend?" He clung to the question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." Valda Theller had just opened her mouth when a voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you in trouble?" The elegant voice sounded estranged, but it stunned Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked up instantly and caught sight of a cold, delicate face. He had a straight nose bridge, sexy thin lips, and was dressed in a light gray suit. He looked just like an elegant gentleman, and those deep phoenix eyes were staring at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... the man she had only met twice!</p></div>
