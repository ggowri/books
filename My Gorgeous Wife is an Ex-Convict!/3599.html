        <h1>Chapter 3597</h1>
        <div><p>&quot;Just now...when I gave them the money, we chatted a bit and I heard them mention it,&quot; he replied.</p><p>&quot;Then why don&#x27;t we think of another way to help them?&quot; she suggested.</p><p>William took a deep breath. &quot;Jasper, everyone has their own way of living in this world. If we try to help everyone completely, we&#x27;ll never have enough time. We gave them money just now, and that should at least relieve their financial worries for a while. We can&#x27;t be responsible for their entire lives.&quot;</p><p>Jasper sighed at his words.</p><p>Although his words sounded harsh, she knew he was telling the truth.</p><p>That night, Jasper stayed at the Barlow House.</p><p>She couldn&#x27;t sleep that night, so she got up and walked out of her room, heading to William&#x27;s bedroom to see if he was asleep. However, when she opened the door, she didn&#x27;t see him in the room.</p><p>Jasper felt strange. It was already late, so where could he be if not in his room?</p><p>Exiting William&#x27;s bedroom, Jasper caught a glimpse of another room not far away from him from the corner of his eye.</p><p>It was... the music room.</p><p>Does William go to the music room?</p><p>As far as she knew, William didn&#x27;t play the piano very often now, only occasionally.</p><p>Nevertheless, Jasper still walked up to the music room and gently pushed open the door.</p><p>The intense sound of the piano suddenly filled her ears.</p><p>Jasper couldn&#x27;t help but furrow her brow. The piece William was playing now had a fierce and dark tone, filled with a sense of contradiction that could even give someone goosebumps involuntarily.</p><p>She rarely heard him play such pieces because she preferred light and bright or lyrical music, so he usually played more of those types of pieces.</p></div>
