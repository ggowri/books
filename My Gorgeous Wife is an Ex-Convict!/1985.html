        <h1>Chapter 1983</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I won't misunderstand. I know the baby in your belly must be mine, and you won't have that kind of relationship with Anthony Sherman either," said Hadwin Stephenson as he bent over and caressed Lina's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you sure... you won't misunderstand?" she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said, "Yes, because I'm the only one you love, aren't I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina heard that, she suddenly cried and embraced Hadwin Stephenson's neck. She started crying on his shoulder. "I... I only love you... Hadwin, you... You're the only one I've ever loved. I... I&rsquo;ve never been intimate with anyone. I never... Never..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She cried like a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He soothed her gently. "Okay, okay. I understand. You don't have to worry about this. I'll take care of it, and I won't let you suffer this undeserved injustice. Stop crying. Didn't the doctor say your greatest task now is to be happy? It'll be good for the baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Upon hearing the mention of the baby in the belly, Lina hurriedly said, "Okay, okay, I'll stop crying... I&rsquo;ll stop crying..." However, her shoulders still could not help twitching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sometime later, Lina finally stopped crying. However, maybe because she was pregnant, she soon fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at the sleeping figure, and tender affection flashed across his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He placed her carefully on the couch and covered her with a thin blanket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was not until he finished doing all these that his face darkened. The incident might seem to be only one post from Anthony Sherman, but it was definitely not accidental that it went viral. Someone did it on purpose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But who's the mastermind behind Anthony Sherman? Who on earth wants Lina to bear this disgrace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just as he tried to turn around to leave, Lina's hand unconsciously held his hand, making him stop in his tracks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin... Let's not... misunderstand each other anymore... What's on the internet... isn't true..." She seemed to be talking in her dream. She was even frowning in her sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked down blankly at her uneasy sleeping face and sat down again. "Don't worry. I won't let anyone who harms you off the hook. It has always been this way, and it will always... be this way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina woke up, she found herself holding Hadwin Stephenson's hand while he sat next to the couch, maintaining the same posture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She quickly let go of his hand. "Did I make your hand go numb? If I hold your hand in my sleep, you can just pull it out. There's no need to indulge me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He smiled faintly. "I'm reluctant to do that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She froze. "You're reluctant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, you still held my hand even when you had fallen asleep. It made me feel like you couldn&rsquo;t live without me and you needed me," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's face could not help redden slightly, but then she seemed to recall something and shouted, "Oh, yes. My parents..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I got someone to pick up your parents and send them to my private mansion. Don't worry. They won't be disturbed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was relieved. 'As long as my parents won&rsquo;t be disturbed by the reporters.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She looked out of the window and realized it was already dark. She picked up her phone and checked the time. It was already eight. She had slept for so long.</p></div>
