        <h1>Chapter 3585</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I really... um, just see him as a friend, definitely not thinking about marrying him," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I do hope she can marry me," a voice suddenly sounded coldly beside them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper suddenly looked embarrassed and looked to the side, only to see that Roger had appeared next to them at some point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little girl looked sad and asked, "Roger, do you... do you like this sister?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I like her," Roger walked up to the little girl and squatted down, saying, "But she only sees me as a friend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked embarrassed as the two, one big and one small, chatted away as if she wasn't there. However, she was the main topic of their conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I like Roger. Roger, will you wait for me to grow up and marry me? I will definitely grow up to be very beautiful, more beautiful than this big sister!" the little girl exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger smiled slightly and replied, "I believe you will grow up to be very beautiful, but if liking someone can be changed so easily, then it cannot be called liking. I think when you grow up, you will meet a boy you like and who likes you back, and he will be better than me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little girl listened, not fully understanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was surprised by Roger's words. He had always seemed cold and distant, not easy to approach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he had told her to become friends, Grace didn't feel like she could open up to him like true friends do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if Roger always gave her a sense of distance, as if there was a chasm between them that couldn't be easily crossed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, as he spoke gently to the little girl, she suddenly felt that maybe he wasn't as difficult to approach as he seemed on the surface.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the little girl ran off, Jasper said to Roger, "You don't have to use me as a shield. When a child says she wants to marry you, it's just because she likes you, not because she'll actually marry you when she grows up. Children's words aren't always true."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really think that children's words aren't always true?" he asked, standing up and staring straight at her with his deep black eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was taken aback, his heart beating unusually fast. Unexplainably, he felt as though his gaze was silently condemning her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But...what was he condemning her for? Just because of what she said earlier?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Adults don't take children's words seriously, but children take them seriously. Sometimes, a single sentence can be engraved in their hearts for a lifetime," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you...have any words that were engraved in your heart when you were a child?" she couldn't help but ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," he answered, "I had words from someone that I kept deep in my heart, even if I wanted to forget, I couldn't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, she had a feeling that the person in front of her was just like Lawrence! If...if he really was Lawrence...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, what I said earlier wasn't just to use you as a shield. I really like you, and of course, I want you to marry me in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was dumbfounded, her cheeks suddenly turning red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Or maybe you like William?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought of what William had said to her before, that he would wait for her to make a decision and give him an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew she liked William, but she wasn't sure if it was the childhood crush kind of liking or if it was a more mature liking as a man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was unsure.</p></div>
