        <h1>Chapter 102</h1>
        <div><p>The third aunt tried her best to persuade Susie. After all, her father and two elder brothers had promised her that they would give her 300,000 dollars when the time came.</p><p>300,000 dollars was equivalent to her yearly salary!</p><p>However, no matter what her daughter or her husband said, Susie refused to cooperate. In the end, the third aunt simply said, &quot;Mom, Big Brother and Second Brother said that if you mess this up and our nephews can&#x27;t afford a house and a wife, they will blame you for the rest of their lives!&quot;</p><p>Susie felt angry and anxious when she heard that. &quot;Do you... do you still have any conscience? Have you forgotten how Grace used to take care of us?&quot;</p><p>The third aunt smiled and said, &quot;Mom, the past is the past, and the present is the present. You can&#x27;t ruin our family and the future of our younger generation just because of her. Besides, my nephew and second nephew not being able to marry also has something to do with her. Why would any daughter of a decent family still want to marry them if they heard that one of our family members was in prison? Not to mention if we don&#x27;t even have a house prepared for the brides-to-be.&quot;</p><p>After a while, Susie gritted her teeth and looked at her third daughter with tears in her eyes. &quot;How... how can you be worthy of your sister?&quot;</p><p>The third aunt didn&#x27;t take it seriously. Her fourth sister had been dead for so many years. Even if she was indeed close with her before, how could that compare to the money she could get now?</p><p>Grace was still surrounded by her cousins out in the front. Her cousin, Stella, was chewing on some crackers as she said with a faint smile, &quot;I heard Grandpa said that he had asked your father about you. Your father said that you&#x27;re a street sweeper now. Is that true?&quot;</p><p>Stella was one year older than Grace, but she had been on the losing end since they were young. Grace had been a straight-A student in school, but Stella couldn&#x27;t even manage to enter a university. After graduating from high school, she went to take on part-time jobs. Later, she ended up marrying a metal smith in the neighboring town.</p><p>At that time, Grace was dating Sean, the son of a rich and powerful family. When Stella thought of the person that Grace had managed to hook up with and thought about her own partner again, she felt inferior and ashamed.</p><p>Now that Grace had fallen so low, she would naturally want to step all over her in return.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s right, I sweep the streets,&quot; Grace said in neither a shameful nor arrogant tone.</p><p>&quot;Sigh, what&#x27;s even the point of you attending university? In the end, you still ended up sweeping the road. But, later... Hehe, you won&#x27;t have to anymore...&quot;</p><p>Before Stella finished her words, Grace&#x27;s first cousin, Hogan, gave her a look.</p><p>Only then did Stella pause in the middle of her sentence. She then looked at Grace with an expression as if she was watching a show unfold. &quot;Hmph, what does it matter how good she was at studying? She&#x27;s still going to end up marrying a fool.&quot;</p><p>She was curious to see how Grace would look like when she got married to that fool.</p><p>In the evening, when the family was having their dinner, Grace finally saw Susie. When she saw Grace, a layer of tears welled up in her eyes, and she hugged Grace for a long while.</p><p>&quot;Child, you must have suffered quite a bit. It&#x27;s all because of my old and weak body. I couldn&#x27;t help you at all back then,&quot; Susie said in the midst of choking up while trying to speak.</p><p>Before Grace could answer, Stella said, &quot;Grandma, Grace being in jail is what we call getting punished by law. She deserved it!&quot;</p><p>Susie glared at Stella. Only then did she resentfully shut her mouth.</p><p>Grace shook her head and looked at Susie. &quot;It&#x27;s all right, I didn&#x27;t suffer much. Besides, haven&#x27;t I already been released? I&#x27;ll come back more often in the future and be filial to you and Grandfather.&quot;</p><p>Hearing this, Susie felt even sadder.</p><p>Mr. Kelleigh and the rest were afraid that Susie would expose them, so they quickly had them sit down to start eating dinner together. During the meal, the eldest uncle, second uncle, and third aunt kept urging Grace to have more wine.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a rare occasion, so it&#x27;s not a bad thing to drink a bit more. Grace, you need to make sure to come back more often and see your grandma and grandpa in the future,&quot; the third aunt said with a smile.</p></div>
