        <h1>Chapter 4211</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the doctor made rounds in the morning, Chandler suddenly walked into the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit looked at Chandler and calmly said, "You're here." As if Chandler appearing in front of him was something he had anticip</span><span>ated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm here!" Chandler said coldly, walking to the bedside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You've seen Tina, right?" Kit said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have, she hasn't woken up yet. The doctor says her condition is not good," Chandler's voice was very cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry," Kit said softly. If he had been more careful while driving, Tina wouldn't be lying in a coma like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The child wouldn't have been born prematurely either!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry? Yeah, you really are sorry, Tina!" Chandler took a deep breath, seemingly restraining the impulse that was about to burst out of him with all his willpower. "I just want to know why you found Tina but didn't immediately inform the Stephenson family and the Hunter family? Why did Tina stay with you for a while? Why didn't Tina contact the Stephenson family and me? Why did you give Tina a false name for medical purposes before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A series of questions came out of Chandler's mouth. He needed an answer now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit's lips trembled, and it took a long time for him to say, "Tina has amnesia."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just this sentence made Chandler's expression even more serious. "What did you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina has amnesia. She doesn't remember anything from before, so I lied to her, hid the truth about you and the Stephenson family, and made her stay here peacefully..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler clenched his fists tightly, and his joints made a cracking sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't expect that Tina had lost her memory!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you tell her anything? Why did you make her stay in a place like this? Kit, why?" Chandler questioned forcefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry, I'm sorry..." Kit kept apologizing without end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Chandler grabbed Kit's hospital gown collar, dragging him up, ignoring the bandages and plaster on his body. He raised his hand and punched Kit in the face.</span></p></div>
