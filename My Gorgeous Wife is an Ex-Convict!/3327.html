        <h1>Chapter 3325</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The staff next to them were watching this scene with great shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is the prince of the entertainment industry. With just a stomp of his foot, the entire industry trembles. Many people are so intimidated by him that they dare not even breathe in his presence. And yet, now he's become so nervous?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Think about it, when the Crown Prince got married, many people said that his wife was not a good match for him and that they would eventually divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But looking at the current situation, divorce... um, it's probably unlikely. It seems that the prince is really in love with his wife!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ambulance arrived at the hospital and Valda was taken to the delivery room. The doctor began to examine her condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Brian was anxiously waiting outside the delivery room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long after, the elderly Mr. and Mrs. Hart arrived and upon seeing their son, immediately asked, "How is Valda doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm still checking, but the water broke early," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is she about to give birth soon?" asked Mrs. Hart, the elderly woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Probably," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fortunately, it's already 39 weeks, so there won't be any risks if the baby is born now," said Mrs. Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After receiving a labor-inducing injection, Valda was quickly taken to the delivery room. Brian, her birthing partner, also changed into sterile clothing and entered the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, for Valda, her only sensation is pain, pain, and more pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It is often said that giving birth is extremely painful for women! Despite preparing herself mentally beforehand, she only truly understood the intensity of the pain once she experienced it herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the pain was intense, she still had a strong determination to give birth to her child safely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She tried hard to follow the midwife's instructions, taking deep breaths and exerting herself without wasting too much energy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">People kept wiping her sweat, but even so, her hand tightly held onto Brian's hand. Both of their palms were sweaty, and it was hard to tell whose sweat was whose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian had previously made a point to watch some documentary films about obstetrics, which also included scenes of women giving birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mothers giving birth have to exert all their efforts and endure immense pain in order to deliver their babies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He has also undergone psychological training, and even in movies and TV shows, many actresses have portrayed the extent of pain they experience while giving birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when he sees others doing it, he doesn't feel much. He thinks that when he accompanies his partner during childbirth, everything should be normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... it didn't work before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was so scared when he saw how much pain Valda was in while giving birth, that his whole body went cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the doctor said that her current condition is good, he is still afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if he made complete preparations, there could still be mistakes. He was afraid that she would be in so much pain that she would lose her strength, afraid that she wouldn't be able to give birth smoothly, afraid that there would be unexpected complications...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He's too scared!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, okay, we can see the end now," the doctor's voice came through. "Push harder!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And as Valda shouted with all her might, a little one covered in amniotic fluid and with a red body was finally delivered by the doctor's hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, as the doctor slapped the baby's feet, a loud cry filled the delivery room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The girl weighs 3517 grams," the nurse reported after weighing the baby, and then placed the little girl next to Valda's cheek.</p></div>
