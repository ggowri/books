        <h1>Chapter 2417</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," the little one muttered in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Philip Barlow left the room, William looked at the tiny sleeping figure next to him. He murmured, "Jasper, don't stop liking me, okay? Don't let anyone else take my place. I'll be a great person one day, I promise!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke in his childlike voice, it sounded as though he was making an oath. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla and Martin Weiss dined in the hotel restaurant with Grace and Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Mick, who was eating quietly, Kyla asked, "Where's Jasper? Didn&rsquo;t she come to Deer City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's at the Barlow family&rsquo;s house. We'll pick her up there later," said Grace. She then told Kyla about the installation of surveillance cameras and the investigation of the attending doctor she had mentioned to Philip Barlow at the Barlow family&rsquo;s house yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, Grace," Kyla said gratefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't mention it," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Halfway through their meal, Kyla wanted to go to the washroom. Grace accompanied Kyla there. After all, nothing could happen to Kyla in her current state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Martin Weiss, Jason suddenly said, "Have you really forgotten your feelings for Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what if I have?" Martin Weiss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you think it's a pity?" Jason smiled and said, "Such unforgettable feelings were gone in the blink of an eye. Don't you ever feel like some part of you is gone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's hands paused as he looked up at him. They had both gone through hypnosis, so one could say that they knew each other's feelings best.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, what are you trying to say?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said slowly, "Sometimes, the so-called hypnosis is just self-deception. You'll only forget your feelings temporarily. There&rsquo;s still a possibility that when you recall them, your yearning will be stronger. When I was hypnotized, I truly forgot some things, but it&rsquo;s different for you. You probably remember everything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason continued, "Are you sure you won't regret it when another man appears by Kyla's side after divorcing her? Are you sure you won't regret forgetting your feelings for her and giving the opportunity to someone else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry about me. I have nothing to regret since I&rsquo;ve already chosen to forget the relationship," Martin Weiss said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you accompany Kyla to Deer City, then? You don't even know how long you&rsquo;ll be staying in Deer City. Since when is the chairman of Weiss Group so free?" Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since when did Emerald City's famous Young master Reed become so free to care about other people's relationships?" Martin Weiss said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's dark eyes were filled with a touch of sympathy. "It's probably because I have something in common with you. I seem to see Grace and me in you and Kyla, so I&rsquo;d like you to have a happy ending as well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is this not a happy ending for me?" Martin Weiss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's far from the end. Do you really think you won't remember anything anymore after the hypnosis? Even if there's no &lsquo;codeword&rsquo; to lift hypnosis, it may be accidentally lifted at some point. Just like me," said Jason.</p></div>
