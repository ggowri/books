        <h1>Chapter 1786</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said nothing in the end. She just broke away from Hadwin Stephenson's grip and got out of the car to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked down at his slightly trembling hand once her figure disappeared from his sight. The touch earlier had made his body ache again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... it would not be long before the blood curse on his body would be lifted. He would then be able to be with Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Hadwin Stephenson returned to the mansion, Katherine Jackson was already waiting there for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had been coming to the mansion every few days to lift Hadwin Stephenson's blood curse. It would take a total of seven times to lift it completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the process was so painful that people had died because they could not endure the pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because you could not stop once you started the process of lifting the blood curse. Otherwise, it would only bite back harder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Let's start," Hadwin Stephenson said indifferently to Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson said sarcastically, "Is it worth it to do this for her? I heard she's still with Anthony Sherman. She doesn't seem to want to be with you. What's the matter? Haven't you told her about the blood curse?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's none of your business," Hadwin Stephenson said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why would you keep it from her? Tell her how much you&rsquo;ve suffered for her and she'll probably want to be with you again," said Katherine Jackson. She was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could not understand why Hadwin Stephenson would go through so much trouble for Lina but refused to tell her what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Just do your part, and I'll stick to the contract. But if you dare tell Lina what you shouldn't say, I can guarantee you that you won't get a single dime," Hadwin Stephenson warned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Katherine Jackson glared at him. 'Why won&rsquo;t Hadwin Stephenson tell her? What&rsquo;s there to hide? He even gave me such a serious warning. It&rsquo;s obvious he's extremely reluctant to let Lina find out about this.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">While Hadwin Stephenson was forcing himself to endure such inhuman pain to lift the blood curse, Katherine Jackson suddenly shuddered and seemed to figure out something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'No way. Is this man... worried that he won&rsquo;t be able to survive the process to lift the blood curse and Lina would be sad if he died, so he&rsquo;s choosing not to say anything?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is he... only planning to tell Lina after he succeeds?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How is that possible? How can there be such a man?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her eyes were in shock as they fell on the handsome face that was now twisted in pain. She felt even more jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was jealous that a plain woman like Lina could make Hadwin Stephenson fall so deeply in love with her. Even if he was misunderstood and suffering so much pain alone, he was still willing to do it for Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What's... so good about Lina?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina, who Katherine Jackson was jealous of, was sighing in her bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Should I... give birth to this baby?'</p></div>
