        <h1>Chapter 2975</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After returning to Brian's villa, Valda solemnly collected these two things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened to it? It's all packed up?" Brian asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This can't be put away, it's been left outside, and I don't really have a suitable occasion to wear it anyway!" She usually wears casual clothes, which are not suitable for wearing these jewelry pieces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially since these jewelry pieces are quite expensive, she would probably be nervous wearing them, afraid of damaging or losing them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well then, I'll make sure to find more opportunities for you to wear these jewelry pieces," Brian joked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda wrapped her arms around Brian's neck and said, "Brian, I suddenly feel so happy right now." But she was also afraid that this happiness was only temporary, and that their happiness together may not last forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more happy she felt, the more afraid she became deep down inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian bent down and kissed Valda on the lips, saying, "I want to make you even happier, Valda...I want you to be happy because of me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Without realizing it, his feelings for her had grown even deeper, and he wanted to give her the best of everything and make sure she never had to worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the private room of the bar, Patrick looked at his friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His usually indifferent face seemed to have softened a bit, and his sexy lips were slightly upturned with a hint of a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you in a good mood?" Patrick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mmm, not bad," Brian admitted readily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because of Valda?" Patrick asked, looking at his friend's eyes. He suddenly felt like he had asked a stupid question. Who else could it be but Valda?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Recently, due to Valda and Brian's breakup, this guy completely gave off an unwelcoming vibe and the atmosphere around him was extremely cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every time he goes to the Hart Group, a bunch of executives come to him to complain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During that time, he was afraid to get too close to Brian, in case Brian didn't like him and he would have nowhere to turn if that happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, a few days ago I tried to meet up with you but you were busy. How come you have time today?" Patrick touched his nose and changed the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda's studio has to work overtime today," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick suppressed the urge to roll his eyes and reluctantly returned to Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh my god, what kind of love potion did Valda give you?" Patrick exaggeratedly acted like he was about to faint. "Do I have to schedule our meetings around her availability now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can also understand it this way," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick was speechless for a moment, but then he said, "By the way, you guys aren't going to break up again, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," Brian said with absolute certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wouldn't let Valda break up with him again! He was determined to grow old with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he first started dating Valda, it was because of Grace's hope. Grace wanted him to let go of his hopeless feelings and start a new relationship, so he found Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But this time was different. This time, he wasn't doing it for Grace, but for himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, his phone rang and Valda's name appeared on the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian answered the phone and heard Valda's voice on the other end. "Hey, Brian? I'll be off work in about half an hour."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll come pick you up," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, see you later," Valda said.</p></div>
