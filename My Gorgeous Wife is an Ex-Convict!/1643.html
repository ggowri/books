        <h1>Chapter 1641</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed looked at the Gregory family&rsquo;s mother-and-daughter indifferently. For the first time in his life, he felt regretful. He regretted telling his father about wanting a sister and letting him adopt Oriel Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He did not like this sister. When he was in the car back then, he had felt sorry for Oriel Lynch and Aunt Lynch when he saw them being bullied and scolded. Now, they only made him feel uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jasper's my sister," said Mick Reed as though that was enough to explain everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch's little face instantly turned red. 'Does that mean Mick... doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge me as his sister? Is it just because I'm not Mr. Reed's biological daughter?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, Oriel Lynch realized that what her mother said was true. Grace was the reason why her mother could not marry Mr. Reed, so she could not be Mr. Reed's real daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In particular, she hated being called an adopted daughter. She preferred hearing people call her something like &lsquo;Little Young Lady&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mick's sister&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, no one had called her &lsquo;Little Young Lady&rsquo; ever since Jasper came to the kindergarten. When someone mentioned Mick's sister, everyone would think they were referring to Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once, another teacher came to their class and asked Mick who his sister was. She was about to stand up when Mick dragged Jasper out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But the friend of Jasper Reed's mother is a homewrecker, and her mother's a homewrecker. That means Jasper will grow up to be a homewrecker as well. Do you want a homewrecker to be your sister?" roared Oriel Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Everyone present turned pale at this remark as they did not expect it from a five-year-old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You can't say that about my mom and aunt!" Jasper wanted to pounce on Oriel Lynch and hit her again. Although she was only five years old, she knew what a homewrecker was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace sprinted into the office and grabbed her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper wanted to struggle at first, but when she saw that her mother had come, she immediately complained, "Mommy, I was a good girl today but Oriel Lynch called you and Aunt homewreckers. I told her to stop but she insisted on calling you that. She also told me to beat her up if I refuse to accept it, so I did!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one explained what had happened with great eloquence and passed the buck, stating she did not start the fight. It was Oriel Lynch who made her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace swept her gaze across her daughter. There were some bruises on her little face but it was not serious. These sorts of scratches were common when children fought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, she looked at Oriel Lynch who was beside her. She also had some scratches on her face but they were not serious. What was serious was the bald patch the teacher had mentioned. It was just above her forehead, forming a concave shape that looked really weird and ugly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At the moment, Oriel Lynch seemed a little scared because of Grace's appearance and unconsciously hugged Irene Lynch around the waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch smiled and said to Grace, "It's just child's talk. Grace, you won't mind it, would you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Of course, I won&rsquo;t mind the things children say. But I&rsquo;d like to know who told her that. It couldn't have come out of nowhere." Grace also smiled faintly but stared sharply at Irene Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There seemed to be a flash of awkwardness on Irene Lynch&rsquo;s face. "Maybe it's because information technology is too advanced now. Well... kids will think what&rsquo;s on the news is true... after seeing it."</p></div>
