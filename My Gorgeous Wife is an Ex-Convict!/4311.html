        <h1>Chapter 4309 Promise</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell didn't expect Tina to say such words directly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His lips twitched, "I do have such medicine, but are you sure you really want to use it on Chandler? If he doesn't want it and you force him to take it, aren't you afraid he will be angry afterward?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Being angry is still better than the parasite continuing to threaten his life," Tina said. As long as she could solve the hidden dangers of the parasite and prevent him from experiencing the pain she had seen before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he gets angry, she can bear it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell suddenly chuckled, "You said that really made me think you've regained your memory. It feels like you're in love with Chandler or something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do love him!" Tina confessed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's eyes flickered, "If you love him, then why do you want to divorce him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We haven't divorced yet, so I'm still his wife!" Tina corrected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell was taken aback, "Not divorced? But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We did sign a divorce agreement, but I didn't go through with the procedures, so legally, we are still husband and wife," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If that's the case, then why did you sign a divorce agreement with Chandler? Is it some kind of game for you?" Lornell said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A touch of sadness flashed in Tina's eyes, "I guess it's because I realized my true feelings too late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this point, Tina's gaze fell directly on the other person, "And what about you? Do you understand your own heart?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell raised an eyebrow slightly, "What, are you planning to meddle in my affairs?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard a rumor that you got engaged to Harley because you saw my relationship with Chandler and wanted to experience what it's like to have a fianc&eacute;."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's true," Lornell admitted openly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, do you love Harley?" Tina asked. "The relationship of being engaged isn't always permanent. It will eventually change, either by breaking up or getting married. Have you thought about where you and Harley are headed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell squinted his eyes. "You don't need to worry about that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina sighed, knowing she had no right to be concerned. "I just don't want you to end up in a situation like mine because you didn't truly understand your own feelings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell chuckled lightly, saying, "I'm not as foolish as you. The Quentin family never does anything they'll regret."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? I hope it's true," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can promise you entry into the Quentin family, and if you need it, I can provide you with the medicine you want. But after the matter is settled, the Quentin family will want your cooperation in researching curse bugs," Lornell concluded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Tina responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then three days from now, I'll take you to the Quentin family. I'll come to the Stephenson family to pick you up," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So it's settled then!" Tina stood up and left the private room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Outside the private room, Harley was waiting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This surprised Tina a bit. She thought Harley would either rest in another private room at the </span><span>club or go have some snacks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, did you talk it out?" Harley asked with concern.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, in three days, I can go to the Quentin family," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great!" Harley genuinely felt happy for Tina. "Then you can see Chandler soon. Regardless, I hope you and Chandler can reconcile and be as close as before!"</span></p></div>
