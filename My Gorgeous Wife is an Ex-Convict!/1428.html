        <h1>Chapter 1427</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mr. Daniels was shocked too. He only thought Martin Weiss looked like a ghost at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin, don't... Don't listen to those reporters' nonsense. I... I did lie to you about the bone marrow donation, but it was only because I love you. I fell in love with you before you knew me. That's... That's why I did it. Although... Although I lied to you, it's... it's not against the law!" Paisley Daniels tried to defend herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Paisley Daniels. "Fell in love with me?" His eyes were red, and his voice was hoarse as he said, "Did you fall for me or the Weiss family&rsquo;s prestige?! Paisley Daniels, do you know that you've ruined my life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How... How could I have ruined your life? I can hardly wait to love you." Paisley Daniels tried hard to look vulnerable. "Martin, I know what I did was wrong and it has upset you. If you want me to apologize to Kyla Corbyn or make amends, I can do it. I'll do whatever you want me to do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You love me? To love me is to lie to me? To love me is to let me be the executioner? To love me is to frame Kyla and make her out to be the person who pushed you down the stairs, causing you a miscarriage? Or did you do it just to get rid of Kyla and strengthen your position as the Weiss family's future mistress?" Martin Weiss suddenly grabbed her jaw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The force was so strong that Paisley Daniels felt like her jaw was going to be crushed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, what scared her more was that Martin Weiss had found out she had framed Kyla Corbyn back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'No, after all these years, how could he have found out? I've destroyed all the evidence that was supposed to be destroyed! Martin Weiss probably made a guess! He can&rsquo;t have any hard evidence!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels struggled to say, "Martin... you've misunderstood. I... I didn't frame her. Kyla Corbyn did push me down..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before she could finish her sentence, he interrupted her sharply, "The doctor you bribed is now in Emerald City's detention center. Do you have to confront him personally before you admit that you framed Kyla? Paisley Daniels, good job. You've done a really good job! I didn't think that I would be fooled by a woman like you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels's eyes almost popped out, and she looked at Martin Weiss in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, the shock turned to horror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels's face was pale, and she was shaking like a leaf. She knew nothing she said would matter now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now that Martin Weiss had found out the truth, with his guilt for Kyla Corbyn, he probably wished she was dead now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss raised his hand and slapped Paisley Daniels to the ground. "I want you and the Daniels family to have a taste of what Kyla suffered back then. I want you to stay in prison for the rest of your lives and never get out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, even this could not eliminate his hatred toward the Daniels family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Mr. Daniels and Mrs. Daniels heard this, they were instantly frightened out of their wits. They kept begging for mercy, but it was to no avail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels seemed to have caved in to despair by now. She stumbled to her feet and gave Martin Weiss a resentful look as she said, "Martin Weiss, you hypocrite! Yes, I framed Kyla Corbyn but didn't you want Kyla Corbyn to go to prison too? You wanted Kyla Corbyn to live a miserable life. That's why you believed me so easily and testified in court&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss stiffened and shouted at Paisley Daniels, "Shut up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels said with a sarcastic smile, "I won't. Martin Weiss, you and I are the same. We both hurt Kyla Corbyn. Why don't you put yourself in prison too, then? Yes, I framed Kyla Corbyn because she was my rival in love, but what about you? Haha, you loved Kyla Corbyn at the time but you could still testify against her in court. You're more ruthless than I am!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels's words were so harsh that they made him feel as if countless steel needles were piercing his eardrums.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin Weiss, you've been struggling all these years. You love Kyla Corbyn but also hate her at the same time! Martin Weiss, you pushed the person you love the most into hell. Who are you to judge me?"</p></div>
