        <h1>Chapter 1838</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Grace heard this, she instantly knew that Dr. Russell had some confidence in his treatment plan. However&hellip; Mrs. Watts&rsquo;s hamstring was cut when she was younger? It surprised Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Was it cut by accident or did someone&hellip; cut her hamstring? If someone did it, who would do such a cruel thing to a woman?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After carefully consulting Dr. Russell about the operation, Old Lawyer Watts and his wife decided to go back and talk it over before coming to a decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace took the two elderly back to Reed Residence and arranged for them to have lunch there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts looked around after entering Reed Residence. He had a good look around and could not stop tutting and praising.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the other hand, Mrs. Watts remained silent. Although she followed him and looked around, she did not make a sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When they passed Jason and Grace's master bedroom, Mrs. Watts suddenly said, "May I... enter this room and have a look?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sure," said Grace as she opened the door. "This is my and Jay's bedroom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts walked into the room, looked around, and walked to the door that was connected to the next room. She raised her hand and gently opened the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It instantly showed the other room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "The room next door is my old room. We don't use it that much anymore. We only use it to keep clothes and personal belongings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The... design is good," Mrs. Watts said somewhat emotionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After lunch, Grace accompanied her mentor and his wife to walk around Reed Residence's main house. When they passed by the mourning hall, Mrs. Watts's expression instantly changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"This is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's a mourning hall. Jay's father passed away when he was very young, so Jay's grandfather built a mourning hall here for Jay's father's memorial tablet. I think it's to hope the dead can rest in peace and give the living a place to mourn. Jay comes here to pay his respects whenever he misses his father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts trembled lightly. Only Old Lawyer Watts, who was holding her hand, could feel it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts squeezed his wife's hand and said, "We've had a busy day today. Let's go back to the hotel to rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Mrs. Watts kept her eyes on the mourning hall. Her lips quivered as she said, "Grace, can you show us inside? Since we've come to Reed Residence today, I think your mentor and I should also offer incense to Jason's... father."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace hesitated a little. "But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, I can see you're doing very well now, so I want to pay my respects to Jason's father too. After all, you know that your mentor and I have no children. I have treated you as my own child all these years. It's only right for us to pay our respects to your father-in-law!" said Mrs. Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright then," said Grace as she led them into the mourning hall. A photo of Jason's father hung on the outer wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had eyes like the calm water. He looked elegant and charming. Who would have thought that he would end up freezing to death on the roadside?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Old Lawyer Watts and Mrs. Watts entered the mourning hall, they stared blankly at the huge black and white photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a long time, Old Lawyer Watts murmured, "It's a shame he died young."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A flash of pain passed through Mrs. Watts's eyes. She eventually looked down and followed Grace into the inner hall.</p></div>
