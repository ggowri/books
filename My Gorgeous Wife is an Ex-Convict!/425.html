        <h1>Chapter 424</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other line, Kyla Corbyn&rsquo;s voice was heard, &ldquo;Grace, Nelson&rsquo;s surgery went well. The doctor said that once Nelson stabilizes in the next two days, he can start with systematic training to recognize voices.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great.&rdquo; Grace was ecstatic to hear the news. &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll come over to visit Nelson this afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Grace asked about the specific ward Nelson was in before ending the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Is it about the child who has hearing problems?&rdquo; Jason asked while looking at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yeah, Nelson&rsquo;s operation went well. I&rsquo;m free this afternoon, so I&rsquo;m planning to go to the hospital to see him,&rdquo; Grace replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You want to come with me?&rdquo; Grace was bewildered and her eyes were wide open. &ldquo;But&hellip; don&rsquo;t you still have work?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just ask the secretary to postpone this afternoon&rsquo;s affairs a little bit. Furthermore, they&rsquo;re not urgent,&rdquo; Jason said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace was well aware that as the president of such a large group, everything was exceptionally urgent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What is it? Don&rsquo;t you want me to come with you?&rdquo; Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No&hellip; that&rsquo;s not it.&rdquo; Jason&rsquo;s willingness to keep her company surprised her slightly, but it also made her heart flutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then, it&rsquo;s decided.&rdquo; Jason lowered his head and continued eating. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace saw this and lowered her head as well to continue eating. Then, just when she was about to finish her meal, his voice suddenly rang in her ears, &ldquo;Sis, can you continue to make me more meals in the future?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was taken aback for a moment. As she raised her head, her eyes met Jason&rsquo;s dark pupils.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled softly, raised his hand, and wiped the corner of her lips; only then did Grace realize that there had been rice grains around her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instantly, Grace&rsquo;s face became flushed once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she could blush easily in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Would that be okay?&rdquo; Jason asked once more, waiting to hear her answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;My cooking is too ordinary, and it&rsquo;s not as good as your chef&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Grace answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;So, what about it? I like to eat what you cook for me,&rdquo; Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Doubt flashed across her eyes. Even if he was not picky with food, there was no need for him to like her cooking so much until the point he wanted to eat ordinary dishes all the time. After all, the professional chefs in the house were much better at cooking than her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps, he was only saying such things to make her happy? Was it all hypocritical flattery? It was akin to the saying, &lsquo;beauty is in the eye of its beholder&rsquo;. After all, he had mentioned before that he would fancy anything she made. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if Jason was able to see the doubt in her eyes, he moved his thin lips and said, &ldquo;I like it when you&rsquo;re busy because of me, Sis. When you cook such dishes for me, there&rsquo;s no doubt that you&rsquo;re thinking of me in your mind, right? So, when I eat the dishes made by Sis, I feel ecstatic. It&rsquo;s because Sis made them especially for me&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The possessiveness Jason was showing Grace had begun getting deeper and deeper. It was to the extent that he was terrified of himself as well. Jason wanted to have all of her, including the food she cooked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, Jason&rsquo;s voice was like a stone that had plunged into the lake of Grace&rsquo;s heart as ripples continued to appear. His gaze, voice, and words seemed to continuously express how much he loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed like&hellip; She was the only one&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed like everything random that she offered to him, he would ecstatically accept it with open arms.</p></div>
