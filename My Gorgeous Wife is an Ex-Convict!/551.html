        <h1>Chapter 550</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if no matter how in love the two people in the photo were, it had nothing to do with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she must have already given up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she just wanted to protect her son and her family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace left the small restaurant and returned to Reed Residence with a heavy heart, Jason said, "Are you still thinking about Nelson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. "Kyla doesn't want Martin Weiss to find her. Kyla has been telling Nelson that his father&rsquo;s in heaven all this time. But Martin Weiss already has someone else. If it were me, I'd stay away and rather not see him again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she said made his brows furrow. She might not have meant what she said, but he, as a listener, took it seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it because... He sent Kyla to prison?" asked Jason. Only he knew how nervous he was when he asked this seemingly ordinary question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Grace gave a resounding answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's heart began to beat so violently that it almost seemed to stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then if it were me... Would you run away and never see me again?" Jason asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You?" Grace looked at him in confusion. "You're not Martin Weiss, how do I answer that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just making an assumption. You promised before that you&rsquo;d forgive me for whatever I did, but... Can you forgive me if I did something like what Martin Weiss did?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that he was serious, she thought about it seriously and shook her head. "Maybe not. After all, there are things in this world that can be forgiven, and there are things that cannot." Therefore, there was a big premise to &lsquo;whatever&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand, which had fallen to his side, twitched suddenly. He felt as though his heart had missed a beat and was falling until it reached a bottomless ice pool.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his hand, suddenly pulling her into his arms. He embraced her deeply. "It... Doesn't matter if you can't forgive me. As long as you promise no matter what happens, you won't stay away from me or never see me again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He held her so tightly. He could bear the fact that she hated and despised him, but he could not bear to never see her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could he bear the pain, if she ever disappeared before him? Would he go completely insane?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loved her more than he could ever have imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt as if she was about to be out of breath in Jason&rsquo;s arms. "What's the matter, Jay? You've done nothing wrong, so why are you talking about forgiving?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Promise me, will you?" He insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Um... If she did not give him an answer, she would probably suffocate in his arms! "But... Why..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because I'm afraid I'll never see you again. I'm afraid that one day I'll do something wrong and you'll make me never see you again," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those days would tantamount to some kind of despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Afraid? Was... He afraid? Grace froze, slowly lifting her hands and&hellip; Hugging Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason gave a sudden jolt, as if in disbelief that she was hugging him.</p></div>
