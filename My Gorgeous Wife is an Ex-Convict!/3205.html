        <h1>Chapter 3203</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they arrived at the main hall, Grace was already looking for her daughter. When she saw her daughter and William walking in hand in hand, she approached them and asked, "Where did you go just now? Auntie Valda and Uncle Brian will come over to this table to toast in a while. Do you remember what Mommy told you at home about what to say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Remember to congratulate Auntie Valda and Uncle Brian on their happy marriage, and also wish them to have a baby soon!" Jasper grinned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace nodded in satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, Mommy, I heard someone playing the piano in the hallway earlier. It sounded really nice! And the person playing was a little boy around my age, but I didn't catch him," Jasper mentioned the incident again. She couldn't stop thinking about the beautiful piano music she heard earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A boy around your age?" Grace was momentarily stunned. Her daughter's talent on the piano had been praised by many piano masters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And being able to play the piano to a level that even Jasper finds pleasing, at a similar age to his daughter, it is likely that the little boy also has an exceptional talent for the instrument.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm." Jasper nodded his little head heavily. "Mommy, can you help me find him? I want to hear him play the piano again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This..." Grace hadn't had a chance to answer when William spoke up beside her. "Jasper, if you want to listen to piano music, I can play for you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he has been studying various courses arranged by his father for the past few years, he has had less time to play the piano. However, he still manages to practice every day by setting aside a certain amount of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that she loved the piano and that it was the strongest bond between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, he definitely cannot give up this bond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But, William, the way you play the piano is different from that person," Jasper murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William bit his lip slightly, seeming embarrassed and unsure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William plays very well too," Grace intervened, trying to smooth things over, while secretly sighing at her daughter's obliviousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the two children are not even 10 years old yet, one is too mature for their age and the other clearly doesn't understand anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Usually, she and her husband often discuss what would happen if Jasper ends up not liking William in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If that's really the case, then even if it's painful, William can only bear it himself. My daughter cannot be wronged," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching William's current expression, Grace couldn't help but feel sorry for the boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, she has seen how William considers Jasper to be the most important person in his life. Whatever Jasper likes, William will do and give to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How many people can meet someone like that in their lifetime?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, it seems that the children are still too young, and Jasper only sees William as a very important friend.</p></div>
