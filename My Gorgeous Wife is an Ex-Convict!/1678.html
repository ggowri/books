        <h1>Chapter 1676</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," they answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It did not take long for Grace to find out about the situation with Sean's mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was suffering from kidney disease. Although she did not have to do uremia dialysis yet, it was pretty serious. She was undergoing conservative treatment before this, which cost over 2,000 dollars a month. She was hospitalized a while ago, and they needed about 100,000 dollars for the treatment plan the hospital gave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, 100,000 dollars was money the Stevens family could no longer afford.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Stevens now owed the hospital 20,000 dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at the investigation report in her hand, Grace found it a little ridiculous. 100,000 dollars. Any bag Mrs. Stevens owned would have cost more than 100,000 dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next day, Grace went to the hospital Mrs. Stevens was in. She looked at Mrs. Stevens, who looked sallow and weak as she lay in the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Stevens, the once proud woman who always liked to wear expensive jewelry, thought she was superior to others, and despised Grace&rsquo;s ordinary family background, was now a frail old woman lying in a hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace remembered trying so hard to please Mrs. Stevens when she was dating Sean, but what she got in return was... "What the hell is this? Aren't you disgracing me by letting me use this? I never use cheap stuff! I have no idea why Sean likes you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Mrs. Stevens was no longer a rich lady and had become an ordinary person! She was even at the bottom rung of this society, struggling to make a living.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The shared ward was noisy and had four beds. There were family members of the other patients here, but Mrs. Stevens's area was deserted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace went to Mrs. Stevens's bedside and looked down at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Stevens, who had her eyes closed at first, seemed to sense something and slowly opened her hazy eyes. They widened when she saw Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Long time no see. I heard you're sick," Grace spoke indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, long time... no see." With some difficulty, Mrs. Stevens sat up and sized up Grace. She smiled bitterly. "Karma... It's all karma. If the Stevens family hadn't treated you this way, we wouldn't have ended up like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Still looking indifferent, Grace said, "Sean saved my life a few days ago. I can pay for your medical expenses."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Stevens froze. Seeing that Grace was about to leave, she immediately said, "No, Miss Cummins... No, Mrs. Reed, I... I don't want you to pay for my medical expenses!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace froze. "You don't?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Stevens said imploringly, "All... All I ask is that you let the Stevens family go. It doesn't matter how long an old woman like me can live, but&hellip; Sean and Zoe are still young. Look at what the Stevens family has become. Please let them go. The... the Stevens family did you wrong, and we got what we deserved. You and Sean... used to love each other, after all. And you said Sean... saved you, so please have mercy and let them off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a touch of fear in Mrs. Stevens's expression when she said these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at Mrs. Stevens who was begging her. Finally, she left the ward without saying anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After leaving the ward, Grace went to the counter to pay for Mrs. Stevens's bills. She did not have any sympathy for Mrs. Stevens but did not want to owe Sean anything. She would just consider it payment for saving her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
