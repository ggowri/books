        <h1>Chapter 1046</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he feared the hug would crush her if it was any tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry..." She heard his voice in her ears. "Grace, can you... let me hold you like this for a while?" he murmured. There was a slight sob to his voice, and it sounded like he was begging her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, he sounded almost inferior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was the high and mighty crown prince of the entertainment industry. When had he ever begged someone like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt as though something was blocking her heart. She did not move and stayed quietly in Brian's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He held her carefully as if he was holding a beautiful dream. She could smell his scent and hear his heartbeat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After some time, he finally pulled away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian apologized for the second time and said, "Sorry, I was a little impulsive... just now and mistook you... for someone in my imagination."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright," muttered Grace, knowing who he was referring to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It won't happen again." His phoenix eyes stared at her, and his voice said firmly, "I won't mistake you for someone else again. You're Grace, the one and only Grace in this world."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'You're also the only one I love!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared blankly at him and saw her face reflected in his dark pupils!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he only had eyes for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed Brian into the charity gala. Although many of the entertainment industry's top celebrities were in attendance, there were no reporters there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Reporters from all news outlets and magazines were stopped outside the venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was brought here by Brian himself and thus, attracted a lot of attention&mdash;especially from people in the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, this was the crown prince. Many women wanted to stand by his side but could only dream of doing so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They started speculating who Grace was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked around, wanting to look for Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, it's still early. Maybe they're not here yet. They're on the guestlist today, so I expect they'll be here later." Brian saw Grace's anxiety and comforted her. "Besides, even if they don&rsquo;t come, I can take you to them tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm glad to help you out. This way, I can see you one more time and talk to you a little more. Many a little makes a mickle. Maybe one day, you'll fall in love with me too," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." She looked at him in shock. She realized for the first time that perhaps his feelings for her were deeper than she expected!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace was interrupted by a familiar voice. "Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked back and saw Lina walking her way with her hand hooked around Hadwin Stephenson's arm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, what are you doing here?" Grace looked at her best friend in surprise.</p></div>
