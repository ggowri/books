        <h1>Chapter 2071</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After ending the call, Kyla quickly got off the hospital bed and packed up her things. "I'm going home." With that, she hurried out of the emergency room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly seemed to come to his senses. He went after her and said, "I brought you out today, so I should send you home too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car drove toward the store. Both of them were silent along the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car stopped at the store&rsquo;s entrance, and Kyla opened the car door to get out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, I don't believe that having nothing to do with each other is the best for us. Since you chose to give birth to Nelson, we&rsquo;ll always be related to each other," muttered Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked and got out of the car without saying anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was not until her figure entered the store that he smiled bitterly and drove his car away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing that her daughter had returned, Mrs. Corbyn asked hastily, "Martin Weiss... didn't do anything to you, did he?" After all, her daughter had gone out with Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, he only helped me find Juliet," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At night, Kyla pulled Nelson to her and asked, "Do you want to continue learning taekwondo? Or do you want to try out the more combat-like kickboxing your daddy took you to see?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn froze. He was about to answer when Kyla said, "Answer me after you think it through. You're nine now, and you&rsquo;ll be ten in a few days. I want you to decide some things related to your future yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After a pause, she caressed her son's head. "If you want to learn how to fight like that, you can just tell me even if it&rsquo;s your daddy who arranged it for you. I know you don't like your daddy, but I don't want what happened between us to affect you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn was silent. He was precocious. Even if no one told him about what had happened between his parents, he had some idea of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He also knew that his mother was letting him decide things this time. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If I continue learning taekwondo, I would have nothing to do with my father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Otherwise, I would have to see my father again... Even if I don't want to admit that the man who hurt Mommy is my father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But I can't change blood ties by will!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Since I can't change them, then... I'll become stronger. I'll get strong enough to prevent anyone from hurting Mommy and myself. I won&rsquo;t let anyone make Mommy sad!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn took a deep breath as he thought of it. He then said to Kyla, "Mommy, I want to learn kickboxing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After Nelson Corbyn decided to learn kickboxing, Martin Weiss took Nelson Corbyn to where he had shown Nelson Corbyn the practice the last time and introduced Nelson Corbyn to a teacher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn had no idea that the teacher was a famous Sanda master in the country. There was no way ordinary people could hire him, and Martin Weiss had paid a high price to make the master willing to teach Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Similarly, Nelson Corbyn had to wear a hearing aid because of his hearing problem, so he needed to get used to fighting without a hearing aid or protecting his hearing aid when fighting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It would be much more difficult for him than ordinary people!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Nelson Corbyn was not a child who admitted defeat easily. He looked shy and obedient, but he was unyielding, which was rare among ordinary children.</p></div>
