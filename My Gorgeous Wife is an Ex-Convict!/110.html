        <h1>Chapter 109</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's nothing." Jason said faintly as if he did not feel any pain, "How long will it take for us to reach the hospital?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Fifteen minutes or so," Terrence said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In her current state, Miss Cummins definitely couldn't go to an ordinary small hospital. She had to go to one of the major hospitals in the city.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the car arrived at the hospital, Terrence finally discovered the ingredients of the drug that Grace had been fed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The doctors had been in touch with them on the way, and they were all well-respected doctors.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If anyone saw these doctors present, they would be shocked. It would have taken a big event for these doctors to gather together in such a short time.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, the doctors were looking at the prescription list of the drug and giving an urgent consultation to a woman who was wearing cheap clothes that had been torn to pieces.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's not a big deal. Give her a sedative and let her sweat until her body pushes the drug out. It should be enough. As long as this drug is not consumed in large doses for a long time, it will not have any long-term effects on the body," one of the famous medical doctors said. "In addition, she can take some medicine over the following three days to accelerate her body's metabolism."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then, give her the sedative quickly," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A sedative was injected into Grace's body soon after, and she immediately quieted down as if she had fallen asleep.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing this situation, Jason finally let out a small sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But we do not have clinical data on this type of drug, so I don't know whether we have injected enough sedatives. If she continues to have the same symptoms as before, I'm afraid that she will need to have another shot," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the doctor left the ward, Jason ordered Terrence, "Go and guard the entrance."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then what about you, Mr. Reed?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I will stay here and look after her," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence glanced at Grace, who was still unconscious. He then looked at Jason and said, "Why don't I look after her? If you suddenly leave like this, I'm afraid that Old Master will..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm afraid that my grandpa will find someone to investigate on his own. There is no need to hide this. Anyway, sooner or later he will find out about Grace." Jason said, "You can leave now, and I will accompany her."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Hearing this, Terrence didn't say anything else and left the ward.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace and Jason were the only two people left in the large VIP ward.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He walked over to the bed, lowered his head, and stared at the person lying there. "Grace..." he murmured in a low voice. He raised his hand and gently caressed her cheeks, which were burning hot. "I'll help you get vengeance for what you've suffered today. Anyone who hurts you will pay for it ten times or even a hundred times. Is that alright?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, the sleeping person did not answer his question.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason sat quietly by the bed and simply looked at her. It was as if this was the only way for him to feel at ease. He could not rest assured if there were others looking after her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a while, her body, which had been motionless, suddenly moved again, and a vague sound came out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason frowned slightly and leaned over, trying to wipe away the beads of sweat from her forehead.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But when he got close to her, her eyes suddenly opened, and then she wrapped her arms around his neck.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her cheeks were still red, and even her lips seemed to be dyed vermilion. It was like her dark almond eyes were covered with a layer of gauze, hazy yet beautiful.</p></div>
