        <h1>Chapter 3765</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She could hear her own heartbeat, would he...hear hers too?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about your compensation? When will you add more?" His voice rang out again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now." Jasper said, and once again took the initiative to kiss William, but this time, she kissed his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her kiss was filled with novelty and boldness. After their soft lips touched, she was not satisfied with just a shallow kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She actively entered his mouth and deepened the kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he only welcomed her move.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Do boys need to protect themselves outside? But how does she know how much he wishes she could do everything to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Those things that make people blush and heartbeat, she knows that he has done them </span><span>many times in his dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In his dreams, he kissed her again and again, entangled with her, and did everything that would make her blush and heartbeat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her crying, her panting, her kisses, were all so real that he almost became addicted to them. But when he woke up, he increasingly realized the difference between dreams and reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His desire for her grew deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the one who really needed to protect herself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The kiss ended with Jasper's phone ringing. Jasper took out her phone, answered it for a moment, and then said to William, "I'm going to the murder mystery game in our class. A classmate has something urgent to attend to at home."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll go with you," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to play a ghost in the murder mystery game, how are you going to keep me company?" Jasper chuckled. "You can go ahead and browse, if you see anything interesting, help me buy it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll accompany you to the entrance and then browse." William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper nodded. "Okay."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As they spoke, they walked towards the murder mystery game venue. Meanwhile, at a concealed location near the third floor window of the teaching building not far away, a figure stood watching their backs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence's hand tightly gripped the window frame. He had seen the whole scene from beginning to end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Jasper kiss William so passionately and seeing their bodies pressed together, he felt an inexplicable anger in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did it hurt so much? It felt like a part of his body was about to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He shouldn't feel hurt. He came back to seek revenge on Jasper, to make Jasper understand the betrayal and pain he had suffered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why was he the one feeling hurt now, before she was?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because of his feelings for her that still lingered?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lingering feelings...feelings that were useless!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William accompanied Jasper to the entrance before saying goodbye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper changed into her ghost costume, put on her makeup, and added a wig. She looked like a long-haired female ghost.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her task was simple: when she saw players arrive, she would chase after them and participate in the murder mystery game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As expected, not long after, she heard some noise. Jasper saw a few players walking towards her, and as planned, she suddenly jumped out from the shadows. Immediately, screams were heard and the players started to scatter.</span></p></div>
