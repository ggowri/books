        <h1>Chapter 4093</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What can you handle? You are now the only legitimate successor of the Hunter family. If you..." The old man was angry and seemed like he was about to scold, but he held back because Tina was also present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you're really afraid of not having an heir, then I can at least guarantee that Hunter won't be without one," Chandler said. Even if Tina didn't want him anymore and he couldn't live properly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So as long as he donates sperm, Hunter's bloodline can continue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But there won't be any emotional connection between him and the child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You--" Mr. Hunter was clearly more angry at Chandler's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ignoring the old man, Chandler took Tina's hand and left the scene!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was confused at the moment. What happened? What does she have to bear? And how did they get to talking about not having an heir?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Does the old man think she can't conceive?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the time Tina came to her senses, she and Chandler were in another room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This room looked like a bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was just a dark gray color scheme with some simple furniture, giving a particularly cold feeling. The whole room was too simple, as if there was no warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this... your room?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's different from your bedroom in Emerald City," Tina muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his villa bedroom in Emerald City, there were many scattered things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For example, there were teddy bears, picture frames with their photos, and various decorations that she thought were pretty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Of course, these things seemed to have been accumulated in his room by Tina over the years, like a mouse moving house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When they get married in the future, Tina also wants to add some warm things to this room so that it doesn't look so empty! Tina thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "How did you find this place?" Chandler's voice suddenly interrupted Tina's thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Uh..." Tina looked guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Seeing her like this, he knew that she probably used some unsavory means. "You know, I won't blame you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Well, you said it yourself!" Tina said as if she had caught a lifeline. "Actually... I put a doll in your car, and there's a locator inside the doll."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's eyes flickered slightly at her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He was always vigilant, but he had no guard against her at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If someone knew that she had found Hunter's location like this, he would probably be laughed at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why did you suddenly want to come here to my family's house?" Chandler asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, he had returned to his family's house many times before, but she had never secretly followed him like this before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Because..." Tina bit her lip and was a little embarrassed. "I want to know you better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Know me better?" he raised an eyebrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Like when you were soaking in the medicinal bath just now, but I had no idea you were going to take a bath, and what's with the black lines on your body?" She had seen his upper body before, but she hadn't seen those black lines on his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler remained silent. How could he explain Hunter's secrets, his regular medicinal baths, and the black lines on his body to her?</p></div>
