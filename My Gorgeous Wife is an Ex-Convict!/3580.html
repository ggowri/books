        <h1>Chapter 3578</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, judging from the previous situation, it seems that they have a deep relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until Jasper, Veronica, and William had left that the two of them seemed to come back to their senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mabel couldn't help but ask, "Who exactly is your assistant?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Angelica also wanted to ask, but in front of Mabel, she showed a smug smile and said, "It seems that Miss. Holt is in trouble. You treated my assistant that way earlier, I wonder if Miss. Reed will be angry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mabel's face changed, and she said, "Don't you use your assistant as a tool? You're not any better than me. Maybe Miss. Reed will blame you first!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two women stared at each other, and after a moment, they both turned their heads in agreement and began to calculate in their own minds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper and Veronica arrived at the lounge, which was fully equipped with washing facilities. Jasper asked Veronica to clean herself up first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll have someone bring the clothes to change into later," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, thank you," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, you're being too polite. Please go clean up first," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica nodded and walked into the restroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper then walked out of the lounge and saw William standing outside. William said, "I have already sent someone to get Veronica's change of clothes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't expect Veronica to be Angelica's assistant. She should still be in college," Jasper muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In recent years, the Barlow family and the Reed family have had very little contact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica only visits the Reed family before New Year each year, and is rarely seen at any other time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She heard from her mother that although the Reed family promised to cover all of Veronica's tuition fees, after she went to college, Veronica insisted that she didn't need the Reed family to pay for her education anymore and didn't want any assistance from them. She was very firm about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, the Reed family couldn't say much and could only express that if Veronica ever encountered any difficulties in life, she could come to them for help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later on, she found out intermittently that Veronica had been working hard to pay for her own education since she entered college.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She used to find it strange that Veronica could have lived an easier life, so why did she make it difficult for herself?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later, her father told her, "Because sometimes, in some people's eyes, maintaining dignity is more important than enduring hardship."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did she become an assistant? You can ask her and find out," William said. "But what about those two female celebrities from earlier? What do you plan to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What to do?" Jasper hesitated for a moment. If it were the old her, she would have thought about how to help her sister Veronica save face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, she knew that if she acted rashly, it might cause unnecessary trouble for Veronica. After all, she could protect Veronica for a while, but she couldn't do it all the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let's find a way to let them know that our family has a good relationship with Veronica," Jasper thought for a moment. In the eyes of outsiders, having the Reed family as a protective umbrella could also prevent some people from making trouble for Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I got it. I'll help you with that," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper smiled and said, "Thank you, William!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, someone brought in the clothes that Veronica wanted to change into, and Jasper walked back into the lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper knocked on the bathroom door and said to Veronica inside, "Veronica, I'm coming in. Please put the clothes in the changing room."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, she heard a "okay" from inside before walking in.</p></div>
