        <h1>Chapter 2253</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla chose a simple Chinese Hanfu dress, which fit right over her clothes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Martin Weiss wore a military uniform from the Second World War.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was refreshing to see him wear that. It was Kyla&rsquo;s first time seeing Martin Weiss in a military uniform too. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the first time, she learned how good he looked in a military uniform!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were already gasps from all around them. The parents reacted better. Some of the women only showed a look of amazement on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the little girls here were already nine to ten years old. Some of them usually fangirled over celebrities. As soon as they saw Martin Weiss in a military uniform, their eyes instantly lit up as they started chattering. Some even took out their phones to take photos of Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It did not bother Martin Weiss. Instead, he started serving drinks as requested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thanks to Martin Weiss, their business was booming. Many people from other classes ran over to have Martin Weiss &lsquo;serve&rsquo; them. Even Nelson's class teacher could not help taking a photo of Martin Weiss serving customers their drinks and then posting it on social media along with the caption&mdash;&rsquo;The waiter today is so handsome! He's a gentle and handsome father!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, someone replied in the comments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Friend: [What's this? Is the waiter's name Martin Weiss?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The class teacher only knew Kyla's name but not Martin Weiss's, so she replied to the comment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Class teacher: [What's the matter? Do you know him? Is he a celebrity?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Friend: [A celebrity? That's the president of Weiss Group!]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The friend replied with a photo of Martin Weiss they found online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The class teacher knew about Weiss Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing the photo, the class teacher widened her eyes at the sight of it. Then, she turned her head to look at Martin Weiss standing there &lsquo;serving&rsquo; customers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He... looks just like the person in the photo!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he really the president of Weiss Group? Is the president of a large corporation working as a waiter... in my classroom?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss's 30-minute shift was over, the class teacher was still in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little girls sighed in pity for quite some time after Martin Weiss took off the military uniform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla removed the costume, her hair was accidentally caught in the hidden clasp on her dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She let out a low cry. She tried to undo it, but the more she fumbled with it, the worse the tangle became. After all, she could not see. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss, who was the first to notice that something was wrong with Kyla, walked to her side. He saw at a glance that her hair was caught in the inner clasp of her dress. "Don't move. I'll help you out," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and began fumbling, trying to detangle her hair from the clasp. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stiffened instantly. Their bodies were so close at this moment. He was tall, so the proximity made it seem like he was embracing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His scent almost enveloped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All her blood seemed to rush to her face.</p></div>
