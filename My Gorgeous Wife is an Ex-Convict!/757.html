        <h1>Chapter 756</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get the car ready. I'll go over now," Jason said in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure!" replied Terrence. He took a glance at the expression on his boss' face and felt as if there was some sort of oppressive taboo in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like there were things that could not be touched and prodded at the moment. Once that taboo was broken, then maybe it would change everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was probably because of Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence thought to himself that Young Master Reed cared far more about Grace than anyone else could imagine. Perhaps even beyond Young Master Reed's own imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Terrence was still a little unclear why Young Master Reed was paying so much attention to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's as if he's afraid that something might happen between Grace and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What exactly is Young Master Reed afraid of?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Terrence suddenly laughed at himself. 'Would Young Master Reed be afraid? I'm probably thinking too much!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sat on a small mound in front of her grandmother's grave, talking about her life now, everything between her and Jason, and her hopes for the future&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were not as many people here as there were at the Lu family's house because it was not tomb-sweeping day or winter solstice, so there were no other people around who came to visit the graves. As such, she could tell Grandma everything. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted her grandmother to hear her from the next world and be happy for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the time, Jason would have been halfway here if he was coming, so Grace spilled wine in front of the grave and cleared away the offerings of food, incense sticks, and candles. She prepared to walk down the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was halfway down the road when she came upon a forked path and stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As far as she could remember, the path led to the next hill, where she had often liked to play on. Then one day, when she came across the path, she was shocked to see graves all over the place!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she got home, Grandma even made her some soothing tea and hugged her to sleep for two nights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, seeing the path, Grace hesitated and checked the time on her phone. It was still early, and Jason would probably need more than an hour to get to the town.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace changed direction and moved toward the path.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not know why. Maybe it had been too long since she went to the hill where she used to play or she wanted to match the landscape in reality with the landscape in her dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe she was giving up for real.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like a ritual&ndash;Going there and letting go of everything in the dream. Ignoring the so-called truth and memory, she and Brian were just strangers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What really mattered to her was Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath and followed the path to the nearby hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more she walked, the more familiar she felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was a child, she used to think of the hill as a place for treasure hunts and adventure games. Now that she was here, the familiar feeling seemed to return. It was as if time had not gone by on this hill. It was still the same as back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even found a big tree that she had liked to mark, and the marks were still on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This place seemed to have too many of her memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Grace froze and stopped in her tracks. Not far ahead was the cliff in her dream.</p></div>
