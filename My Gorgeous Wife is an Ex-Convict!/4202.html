        <h1>Chapter 4200</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit's body tensed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of his claustrophobia, at this moment, the fear caused by the darkness spread through his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he kept telling himself to be strong, and not to be afraid, he still needed to protect Tina and the baby in Tina's belly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his body was trembling badly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you afraid of the dark?" Tina's voice came from beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." he struggled to speak, but his voice was trembling with just this one word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if he was silently admitting to this answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't be afraid." Tina gently said, reaching out her hand and tightly holding Kit's hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was startled, feeling the warmth transmitted from her palm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Someone will come to repair the elevator, it will be fine soon, don't worry, I'm here with you..." her voice continued to come steadily and powerfully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart gradually calmed down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if no matter what happened, she would be by his side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the lights in the elevator came back on, the elevator started moving again. Kit looked up and looked at the person standing beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On that handsome face, there was a gentle smile, and in her eyes, there was still concern for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, he couldn't help but be stunned, his gaze unable to move away from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It had always been her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the past, she had helped him overcome this fear in a pitch-black store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, it was still her who helped him drive away all his fears in that pitch-black environment just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he not love her, with her being like this?</span></p></div>
