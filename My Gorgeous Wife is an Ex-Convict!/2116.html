        <h1>Chapter 2114</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Maybe this was what happened when you loved someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">You would just fall in deeper and deeper. If that person did not love you, it felt like the end of the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss came to the Reed family&rsquo;s house at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked surprised when she heard what the butler informed her. "Martin Weiss is here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, he said he wants to meet Young master Reed. Besides, he seems to have had some drinks. He reeks of alcohol," the butler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason pondered for a moment and said, "Let him in." Then, he showed up in front of Grace. "I'm going to see what's up with him for coming over so late."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay." Grace nodded. After all, she was curious about Martin Weiss's sudden arrival.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Could something have happened between him and Kyla again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss walked into the Reed family's living room with a bottle of wine. Watching Jason walk down the stairs, Martin Weiss raised the bottle of wine in his hand and said, "How about having a drink with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly. "Did you come here for a drink?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, I came here for a drink. I can't even find someone to drink with in Emerald City. Come to think of it, I'm more familiar with you." Martin Weiss had come across Jason before when Kyla was hospitalized. It was also because of her that they met again several times after Grace returned to the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't you still have your men? Ask them to have a drink with you. They&rsquo;ll be happy to do it," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's different." Martin Weiss smiled sadly and said, "They can follow my orders, but they might not be able to really listen. Besides, it's inappropriate to confide in them these trivial matters."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So you came tonight to confide in me?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, what do you think? Do you want some?" Martin Weiss raised the bottle of wine again,</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason smirked. "Okay, I'll drink with you." Therefore, he ordered the maid to bring the wine glasses and began drinking with Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Speaking of which, I made Kyla suffer so much for Paisley Daniels. You warned me back then, saying I would regret it someday. I scoffed at the time, but now it's like a hard slap in the face," said Martin Weiss. Then, he threw his head back as he took a swig of wine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did things not go well between you and Kyla?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We've registered and received our marriage license. The baby will be born in 8 months. It's going well, isn't it? But... she still won't love me. Tell me... What's it gonna take to get her to take me back? Why is it so hard..." he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason looked at Martin Weiss quietly. He once thought that the man was similar to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss had put Kyla in prison while he had coldly watched Grace get imprisoned. Besides, Grace had also suffered a lot in prison because of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he was luckier than Martin Weiss. He was less ruthless than Martin Weiss, and Grace had forgiven him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Martin Weiss was much too ruthless to Kyla back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Regardless, you're married to Kyla now. Since you're married, you don't have to be so desperate," said Jason.</p></div>
