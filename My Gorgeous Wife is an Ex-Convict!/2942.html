        <h1>Chapter 2940</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pursed her lips and set aside her sketchbook, silently watching him on the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would she miss him like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And what about him? How long would it take for him to find someone he could love?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was afraid of her future jealousy, which could ruin their present happiness. She was afraid that he loved Grace too much and would never love her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Actually...she was really afraid of a lot of things in this relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But...was it really going to end like this? Valda Theller's hand couldn't help but stroke Brian Hart's cheek, feeling his warmth in her palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian Hart, can I really do this?" She murmured, asking him and herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Brian Hart's brow furrowed and he shook his head from side to side, looking uneasy. "Valda Theller...don't..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was taken aback. Was he having a nightmare? And he dreamed of her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then she saw his forehead break out in a thin layer of sweat, and the temperature of his skin in her palm seemed to be rising.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian Hart!" she shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But he remained asleep, murmuring, "Don't...don't...Valda Theller...you can't, absolutely can't..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller frowned. What did he dream of? What did she do in his dream that made him say "absolutely can't"?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But in his current condition, he might have a fever. The doctor had warned her to be especially careful about whether he had a fever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of this, Valda Theller quickly pressed the nurse button next to the bed and waited for the nurse to come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But just as Valda Theller pressed the button, Brian Hart, who had been closing his eyes, suddenly opened them and looked at her with his dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You...you're awake?" Valda Theller was stunned. "You seem to have a fever. I've pressed the nurse button and the nurse will be here soon..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish her sentence, he sat up suddenly and hugged her tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"...Brian Hart?" Valda Theller was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller!" he urgently called her name. "You can't...you can't jump down...absolutely can't!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was confused. What was he talking about? Jump where?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You...you let go first, I...I'm not going to jump anywhere," she shouted, but didn't dare to struggle easily, afraid of hurting his wound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But his arms tightened around her, making it harder for her to breathe, and his urgent voice kept calling her name, as if he was afraid of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even this embrace was trembling, because his body was shaking.</p></div>
