        <h1>Chapter 2868</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "I'll stop loving you, Brian. I don't regret loving you, but I'll slowly forget my feelings. Perhaps we'll run into each other on the streets someday. Then we can have a cup of tea and chat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe that possibility would be good too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the more she spoke, the ghastlier his expression grew. "Forget? Do you really think you'll ever forget?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... think I can," she said as she met his eyes, not wanting him to know how scared she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could someone easily forget falling for a man like him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "What if I want you to keep loving me? I'll treat you better than before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, treating her &lsquo;well&rsquo; was not love after all. Valda Theller's eyes dimmed. "Brian, you&rsquo;ve been very kind to me, but I love you, so... I&rsquo;ll greedily want to be the person who matters the most to you. I want you to rush to protect me without hesitation when I'm in danger. I want you to love me the most."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, she said, "Unfortunately, I know it's impossible. I know how important Grace is to you, and I know nothing will happen between you two, but... I'm afraid I&rsquo;ll become increasingly jealous of Grace if I continue to love you. Then maybe I&rsquo;ll do something even I'll be disgusted at."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mouth was full of bitterness, and she confessed what was on her mind to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want to be someone like that, so I might as well end this relationship before I get more jealous," Valda Theller said with a bitter chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You said you would try to make me fall for you. Now that I'm starting to like you, you want to break up with me. Valda Theller, I won't allow it! Do you hear me? I won't allow it!" He pulled her into his arms and held her tightly, afraid that the person in his arms would disappear if he let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She nestled quietly in his arms, considering it a final perk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This chest would no longer be hers to embrace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller murmured, "I'm sorry. I thought I could work on it slowly and wait, but I then realized... I need more than affection. It's a pity... I can't make you fall in love with me, but I think you'll find someone whom you can fall in love with."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He trembled as every word she said stabbed his heart like a sharp sword.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you're still going to break up with me no matter what I do, right?" After an unknown amount of time, his voice rang out suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," she replied softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When his arms loosened, she knew it was time to say goodbye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you want to break up, I'll give you what you want, but you must think it through. Once we break up, I won't protect you anymore, let alone do anything for you. Do you... still want to break up?" He looked at her with what seemed to be the last hope in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart ached. 'What am I expecting?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I expecting him to get rid of his feelings for Grace? But he can't do it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had overestimated herself in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's break up." She heard her voice saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller had no idea how she got out of the hospital or returned to her apartment. When she woke up, she was in her living room with a sketchbook in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sketches in it were... all him! They were all sketches of Brian!</p></div>
