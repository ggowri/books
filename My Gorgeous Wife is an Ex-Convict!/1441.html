        <h1>Chapter 1440</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's not up to you to decide whether or not my son can stay," said Kyla Corbyn. She was holding her son's hand and planning to leave to calm him down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, there were a lot of parents here. She did not want a conflict like this to embarrass Nelson further.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the parent suddenly shouted, "Why should we let our children attend the same kindergarten as the child of an ex-convict? A convict's child may grow up to be a convict too. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It runs in their blood!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The volume was loud enough to be heard by everyone around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All the parents around them looked over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn stopped in her tracks and turned around to glare at that parent coldly. "What do you have against me to say such malicious things? You&rsquo;re even saying these things in front of the children. Please apologize to my son. He has never broken the law. You have no right to speculate his future so maliciously!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The parent was startled by Kyla Corbyn's imposing manner but still spoke like a shrew, "Apologize? Why should I apologize? Just because you've been to prison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Kyla Corbyn glared at them. Having been imprisoned was the deepest pain in her heart and also the beginning of all her sufferings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even so, she would not allow anyone to criticize her son like that, or it would traumatize him forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She held his son's hand firmly as she glared at the woman in front of her. "I'll sue you if you don't apologize. No matter how much time and energy I have to spend, I'll make sure you'll apologize to my son!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had to do it before she died. Perhaps it was one of the few things she could do for Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Haha. Sue? That's funny. How dare an ex-convict sue someone else?" the woman sneered, ignoring what Kyla Corbyn said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, a male voice rang out suddenly, "If you don't apologize, be prepared to receive a summons from the court. You'll have to pay more than just an apology by then. I swear I'll sue you till you go bankrupt and have no recourse!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That cold voice and malicious tone seemed to silence the arrogant woman immediately. She stared at the person before her in confusion. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The woman had read about Kyla Corbyn from the internet, so she had naturally seen photos of Martin Weiss online as well and knew what he looked like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She thought Martin Weiss must have disliked such a disabled child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Martin Weiss was now right in front of her, looking like he was standing up for Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Someone had explained Martin Weiss's background online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Someone had dubbed Martin Weiss the &lsquo;cuckold king&rsquo; because of Paisley Daniels's incident, but who would dare to say that to his face?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, in recent news, Martin Weiss had personally reported to the police saying that the Daniels family had committed a series of crimes including fraud. With the hard evidence, the police immediately detained the three members of the Daniels family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, people were also calling Martin Weiss ruthless online!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was even so ruthless to his ex-fianc&eacute;e, what more if it were a stranger?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The woman's face turned extremely pale, and there was a trace of fear in her eyes.</p></div>
