        <h1>Chapter 2797</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have a cramp... in my leg. Ouch!" Grace said in pain. She had been getting more leg cramps as she was further along in her pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially when lying down. Grace would easily have a cramp whenever she tried rolling over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason bent over and gently lifted her nightdress. His eyes fell on her two legs. "Left leg or right leg?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Right leg," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His long fingers began massaging her right calf, relieving her pain with moderate force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you feel better now?" he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I feel a little better," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He then continued massaging softly. She looked at him in silence as if she could do so until the end of time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla returned to the store, she was surprised to see a black Maybach parked just outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stopped as her heart sank slightly with a certain bad feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, when she walked into the store, her mother told her, "Martin Weiss's here. He's inside. He said he has something to say to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla nodded and replied in acknowledgment. She was preparing to walk in when Mrs. Corbyn said worriedly, "You and him..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Everything's going to be okay. We have nothing to do with each other except this marriage. Martin Weiss must have come to talk with me about the press conference. It was the last thing I could do for him. I&rsquo;ll just think of it as paying him back for donating me his liver again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn sighed and said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stepped into the room at the back of the store. Sure enough, she saw Martin Weiss sitting in the cramped living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, Mr. Weiss," Kyla said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's dark eyes looked up at her. "Did you call me Mr. Weiss? Didn't you just call us a loving couple at the press conference?" His voice sounded sarcastic but also seemed to contain something else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, I won't call you Mr. Weiss in public, but I think it's better to be polite when there's only the two of us." In case she forgot her goal and thought they were in love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You didn&rsquo;t have to agree to such a thing. Even if Weiss Group does lose some money, the company won't collapse," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "But the press conference proved that it worked. The share price has started to recover. I'm going to L City in a few days. You don't need to come."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her and said, "Are you really going to pretend we're a loving couple in public? It's not too late for you to back out. I can make up some other excuses."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only smiled faintly. "There's nothing to regret. You haven't filed the divorce papers yet, so we're still married. I did what I thought I should do. You can make an excuse to end our marriage when this is over."</p></div>
