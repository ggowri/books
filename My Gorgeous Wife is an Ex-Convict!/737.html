        <h1>Chapter 736</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, Grace stopped struggling and calmed down. "It was Stella who saved you, wasn't it? Mr. Hart, you found this out yourself, I suppose. Don't you find it amusing to ask me that now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words were like a basin of cold water, pouring down on him and turning him pale in an instant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, don't you find your speculation absurd? How do you think Stella would feel if she was here and heard what you just asked me?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His reddened eyes were still fixed on her, and indeed, all the clues in his investigation pointed to Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those clues were telling him that Stella Lindsay was the one he was looking for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But why do I think the woman in front of me is the one? Is it because of her looks? Or is it because of the look in her eyes that she sometimes showed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The look where she retains a trace of pride even though she was trampled on, and the yearning for and pursuit of the so-called justice... It's so similar!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you&hellip; Really not her?" He spat these simple words out of his mouth with such difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly chuckled. "That's right. You're not. You're not..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this fact made him feel as if he was immersed in ice water. He was cold to the bone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why did he feel so bad when she said that she was not her? It was as if his heart was being ripped out of his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Little by little, he unclenched the fingers that held her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was finally free and hurried out of the exit passageway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian seemed to have lost all his strength. He leaned dejectedly against the wall beside him and laughed bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She's not her after all. It was all wishful thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stella is the one who saved me when I was little. I shouldn't have any more doubts, right?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hurried out of the hospital, still having a heavy heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that she had made up her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she said to Brian that she was not her, she had already decided never to find the truth about the dreams and verify whether she had ever lost her memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back at Reed Residence, Grace learned from the servant that Jason was in the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This surprised her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Usually... There seemed to be nothing that required him in the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she got to the kitchen, she found that other than him, there was a chef who was teaching him how to... Pipe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, pipe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only saw Jason holding a piping bag, a common tool used by bakers, while he piped buttercream flowers on top of a baked cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Holding the tool with his long fingers, he moved around the cake smoothly. He could have been a walking advertisement for the cake shop!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a strange feeling for Grace to see rose after rose appear under his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not even know he had it in him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not until Jason stopped what he was doing that Grace walked into the kitchen.</p></div>
