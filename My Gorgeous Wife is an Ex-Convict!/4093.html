        <h1>Chapter 4091</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is...a kiss?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He's kissing her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was a bit slow to react for a moment. After all, Chandler's situation just now seemed very wrong. How did it suddenly...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, the door of the room was suddenly pushed open, and a group of people rushed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Young Master, you..." The rest of the words were stuck in their throats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyone could see that the person who was half-soaked in the medicinal pool at the moment was in the middle of a kiss, and the initiator was their Young Master.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The passive party was obviously struggling to breathe from the kiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina felt like she was being devoured. She was being kissed by her brother Chandler, which made her feel strange.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if she wanted to push him away and find out what was going on with him first, her strength was useless in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed that no matter what he did, she could only passively endure it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After what felt like a long time, the kiss finally ended. Tina gasped for air, then turned her head and was stunned!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was already a row of people standing around them, but she didn't know when they had arrived!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Those people are staring at them in shock right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So... everything was seen by those people just now?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Especially now that she and Chandler are still in the medicinal bath, with her soaking wet and Chandler not wearing anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina can already guess what those people are thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even though she's usually carefree, her face is now red with embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler, on the other hand, faces those who barged in with a stern expression and says, "Everyone, get out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Those people quickly file out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Suddenly, the room is left with only Chandler and Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Are you... okay?" Tina looks at him with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although he looks like his usual self now, with no signs of the pain he showed earlier, there was a hint of agony on his face just a moment ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But now, he seems fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm fine," Chandler says, using both hands to lift Tina under her arms and placing her on the edge of the bath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You should go out first. I want to continue soaking in this medicinal bath," he says.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But I want to stay here with you," Tina says, still feeling uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need!" Chandler refused, "You better clean yourself first. This medicinal bath may be useful for me, but for ordinary people, it may not only be useless, but also harmful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You go clean up first. When I finish soaking in the medicinal bath, I will come find you!" Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina could only leave the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the room, only Chandler was left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Until now, he felt somewhat powerless as he fully immersed his body in the medicinal bath!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clearly, soaking in the medicinal bath would make his whole body ache before, but strangely, that feeling of pain disappeared now. Even the medicinal bath gave him a comfortable feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And this change... was all because of Tina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because Tina's proximity earlier had made him impulsively kiss her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even at the moment of kissing her, his mind was blank, and it was purely instinct driving his body to make that kind of action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for those servants barging in, he might have really...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking of this, his body seemed to be filled with some kind of heat, making his skin gradually hot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tina..." Chandler called out this name in a low, hoarse voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The voice was hoarse... but also emotional!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p></div>
