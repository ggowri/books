        <h1>Chapter 983</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the diner, several women looked sideways at Brian. Grace now regretted bringing him there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe they should have gone to a restaurant with a private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ordering a few dishes, Grace looked at Brian. "I heard you helped search for me after I disappeared yesterday. Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, I didn't help much, did I?" Brian smiled faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you anyway. However..." Grace paused and looked at the person in front of her seriously. "Yesterday, you said you would wait for my answer. I can give you an answer now. I don't love you, so you don't need to waste your time on me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his eyebrows slightly. Speaking of which, this was the first time he had been rejected by a woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whether he had mistaken her for someone else in the past, or now when he had fallen in love with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you rejecting me because of Jason?" he asked nonchalantly, looking as if her refusal had not affected him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," she said as she shook her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Jason had said nothing, she would still have rejected him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she was already emotionally drained. She was too drained to love again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I can't commit to a relationship because I've had too many girlfriends before?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Like you said, you've had a lot of girlfriends. All of them were pretty, talented, and special. Why me?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Evelyn had good looks. Otherwise, she would not have been offered minor roles one after another over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian laughed at himself. "Then you should know they were just substitutes for my longing. I wanted to find that person so much that I would let these women be my girlfriends as long as they looked similar to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark phoenix eyes stared at her as he spoke. "However, maybe it&rsquo;s just like what you said. If I really missed the person, it doesn't matter how many substitutes I find. I've been looking for a replacement, but this only made the longing stronger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The look in his eyes made her guilty suddenly. It was as if he had seen through something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No. No way!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would not know that she was the little girl from his childhood. Knowing Stella, she would never tell him. She would only wish she could keep it a secret forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pursed her lips together. "Haven't you found the one you&rsquo;re looking for?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Yes, I have. It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve found her that I&rsquo;m even more sure that I love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he found the one he had been persistently looking for, he realized that his obsession was only what he thought it was. He never felt any butterflies in his stomach when he looked at Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could think of her as his savior, but he would never fall in love with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was the only one who could give him that feeling...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over the years, no matter how many beautiful and talented women there were, no matter how many girlfriends he had over the years, and no matter how stunning the women were, they would not make him feel that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace&rsquo;s smile, no matter cold or indifferent, was always stuck in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip uncomfortably for a moment before she said, "Could it be your imagination? Just like how you thought... I was the one you were looking for, and now you think you love me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly chuckled. "Grace, does the fact that I'm in love with you strike you as so inconceivable as to warrant suspicion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She choked.</p></div>
