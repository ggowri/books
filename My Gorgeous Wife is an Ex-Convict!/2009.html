        <h1>Chapter 2007</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Nelson kept his head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was Grace who suddenly noticed that the hearing aid Nelson was supposed to be wearing was missing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace frowned. She stepped forward, gently cupped Nelson Corbyn's cheeks, and asked, "Where's your hearing aid? Why is it gone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew Nelson could read lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson turned pale. Kyla and Lina had also noticed that the hearing aid was missing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What happened? Why is his hearing aid gone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The class teacher nearby said, "Here's what happened. Nelson Corbyn got into a fight with his classmates and his hearing aid accidentally fell into the drain. It'll be a miracle to find it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What on earth happened? What were they fighting about?" Grace asked as she looked at the class teacher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nelson Corbyn's hearing aid fell to the ground by accident. A student picked it up to return it to Nelson Corbyn, but he beat them up. Several other students got involved and the hearing aid eventually fell down the drain during the scuffle," the class teacher explained what had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace frowned. Nelson was not someone who would pick a fight with others for no reason. The truth was probably not as what the teacher said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sure enough, when she looked at Nelson, she saw an aggrieved expression on Nelson's face. Grace knew that Nelson knew what the teacher was saying even though he could not hear. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Have you investigated the cause of Nelson's fight? And Nelson is here. What about the classmate he fought with? Where are they?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The children are in the infirmary, having their wounds tended to. They&rsquo;ll be here soon. I&rsquo;ve also informed their parents. Nelson Corbyn and Nelson Corbyn&rsquo;s mother, apologize to them. You should pay them if they ask for compensation for medical expenses. I think they're reasonable people and the matter will end here,&rdquo; the class teacher said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace asked, "Can we also ask them to compensate for the hearing aid and apologize to Nelson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The class teacher seemed displeased. "Who are you? I'm talking to Nelson Corbyn and Nelson Corbyn's mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm Nelson Corbyn's godmother as well as a friend of Nelson Corbyn's mother. Of course, I need to find out why Nelson Corbyn should apologize and pay their medical bills when they don't have to do the same," Grace said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's because Nelson Corbyn started the fight in the first place. Of course, he should apologize and his parents should compensate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How did you draw that conclusion?? Witnesses? Material evidence? Or just based on what the others in the fight said?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That person is the vice class monitor. Several other students who were involved also said Nelson Corbyn started it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But they're already in conflict with Nelson Corbyn. Even if they go to court, the judge might not believe them. But you&rsquo;re believing them without a doubt!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..." The class teacher froze, and the displeasure on their face grew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Did my son and the others lie, then? It seems that you want to go to court. Alright, I'll see what the judge has to say about this!" A voice suddenly rang at the office door.</p></div>
