        <h1>Chapter 2733</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Outsiders would only think that the couple was loving and happy, but... how would Brian feel when he saw that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't we leave earlier? We've met... so many people anyway. Everyone in your circle probably knows I'm your girlfriend now," said Valda Theller. However, her intuition told her that maybe the biggest reason he brought her to the banquet was to meet Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is our fake relationship just to show Grace?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian shook his head and said, "There's no need to leave early. I have to introduce some more friends to you. But... lend me your shoulder for a moment, will you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, okay," she replied in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian bent over and laid his head on her shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was instantly a heavy feeling on her shoulders, and she could feel his warm breath on her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller suddenly felt that the man in front of her looked exhausted, and she seemed to have become his only support at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised her hand slowly to his back and patted him gently as if she was soothing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For some reason, she wanted to do that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stiffened slightly before relaxing. He did not like women touching him too intimately, but he did not want to stop her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps he needed her to soothe him like that right now, or perhaps... it was because she was his girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, thank you," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Valda Theller's face turned red again. "You... You don't need to thank me. It's what I'm supposed to do," she stammered without thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled. She always seemed to lighten his mood. "You're right. We're currently a couple. Let me lean on you a little longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He continued to lean quietly on her shoulder. Time seemed to have stood still.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like that, in one corner of the banquet hall, a man quietly leaned on a woman's shoulder. The woman patted his back with one hand. It was sweet, serene, and as beautiful as a painting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the banquet ended, Valda Theller had lost track of how much Brian had drunk. Brian even helped her drink the wine they offered her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller wanted to say she could drink a little bit of alcohol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian did not sway like those drunkards even after drinking so much wine. He was still sober and could chat with others. Even so, Valda Theller could see the intoxicated look in Brian's eyes when she looked at them carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver was already waiting outside when they left the banquet. The two got into the car, and Brian told the driver to drive to Valda Theller's place first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the car slowly drove away from the venue, Brian leaned heavily on the back seat and closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only now could he allow himself to be numbed by alcohol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at Brian beside her. There was no light in the car. The only light source was the street lamps and moonlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could see his face clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had exquisite features and a defined face. He was the crown prince of the entertainment industry. Many people who dreamed of stardom hoped he could fall for them. That way, they could rise to the top. Many popular celebrities also hoped they could get better resources from him.</p></div>
