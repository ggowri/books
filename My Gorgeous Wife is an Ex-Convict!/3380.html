        <h1>Chapter 3378</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, after his eyes adjusted to the current lighting, he finally saw clearly that above them, there was a stone pillar supporting another pillar, creating a triangular space that allowed him and her to survive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, at the same time, they were also unable to move due to the small space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, even if the space is large enough, he doesn't know if he can move because every bone in his body is in excruciating pain right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It is unclear whether the rescue team will find them first and save them, or if the pillar will collapse due to instability or other vibrations, and no one knows which will happen first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When will someone come to rescue us?" the little one asked. "I'm in pain right now, but I can't get up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although it hurt, Harley tried hard to hold back her tears and didn't cry anymore. Her mom had told her that when facing difficulties, she should be a brave little kid. So...um, she wanted to be brave!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know, maybe soon... Maybe... We might die before anyone comes to rescue us," said Lornell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, the meaning of death is actually very clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley is only 3 years old and doesn't fully understand death. She knows that when someone dies, they are gone and can no longer see their parents or play with their favorite toys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We won't die! Not a chance!" Harley immediately retorted. She still had so many toys to play with, and her daddy even said that when she starts kindergarten, he'll buy her a pretty little backpack!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And, most importantly, she doesn't want to be separated from her mommy and daddy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell remained silent because whether he would live or die was not something they could decide!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My mommy and daddy will definitely come to save us!" the little one said with unwavering conviction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Perhaps they are all in danger themselves," said Lornell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little one didn't understand the meaning of this four-character idiom at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your parents may have been hit by the explosion and could be trapped like us, waiting for someone to rescue them." He had originally wanted to say that her parents might not have survived the explosion, but when the words reached his lips, he changed them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My parents will be fine!" The little one's voice, with a hint of crying, "They are definitely safe and sound now, and they will come to rescue us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, Lornell felt a damp sensation around his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this... her tears?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't cry," said Lornell. Although he didn't mind her crying, her tears somehow fell on his neck, making him feel a burning sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I-I didn't cry, I'm a brave baby," Harley choked out, refusing to admit that she had cried. "Anyway, my mommy and daddy won't... won't let anything happen to themselves, let alone us. They will definitely come find us and rescue us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She firmly believes in this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time is passing slowly, and the sounds that Lornell was hearing in his ears seem to be getting quieter and quieter, until they eventually fade away completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Around here, it seems to be getting more and more quiet.</p></div>
