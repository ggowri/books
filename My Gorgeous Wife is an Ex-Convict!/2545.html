        <h1>Chapter 2543</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, his wealth and background were too attractive to women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who is this woman? Did she recognize me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the woman said nothing after finishing her words. She just quietly stayed by his side while holding the umbrella. She did not make others find her annoying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not take another step and just stood where he was, glancing into the distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The heavy rain washed away everything on earth as if to wash away all the filth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you ever loved anyone?" The words slipped out of his mouth, and he wondered why he was talking to an unfamiliar woman about this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze. Her hand clenched the umbrella slightly before answering, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But my love was only a joke. He never loved me. I was only a bet he made with others. How cliche, right?" Valda Theller laughed at herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though it had been a long time ago, it was still a wound in her heart. She always acted as if she had forgotten about it in front of people she knew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she spoke about it so naturally in front of this stranger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, I'm trying my best to forget him and withdraw all my feelings for him. The biggest waste of one&rsquo;s feelings is falling in love with someone who isn't worth loving," she let out a breath and said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian murmured, "Withdraw? If you can withdraw your affection, that only means your love isn't deep at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him with some surprise after hearing him say that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you ever been deeply in love?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not answer her but looked up at the sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The rain had begun to taper off, and the sky was clearing up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The rain ended as quickly as it came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before they knew it, the rain had stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his hand and hailed a passing taxi. He got in and left, leaving Valda Theller to stand blankly in the same place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only felt like it was a dream. The man left so quickly that he did not even say goodbye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This guy wasn&rsquo;t hurt by love, was he? Is that why he drenched himself in the rain and showed such a sad expression!' Valda Theller thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what kind of person could hurt this man's feelings?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, when they were conversing earlier, she had gotten close enough to see his face. Even though his hair was wet, his face was bruised, and he looked messy, she could still see that his facial features were exquisite&mdash;especially those phoenix eyes. If the indifference in his eyes turned into tenderness, it could easily charm people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man like that should be able to attract women easily, but he looked like he had been dumped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was curious, but she then chuckled. It was none of her business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if the man earlier were dumped by someone, he would probably have a new woman around him soon.</p></div>
