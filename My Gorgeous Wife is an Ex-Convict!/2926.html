        <h1>Chapter 2924</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller immediately dialed her friend's phone number, but the prompt tone from the phone indicated that the other party's phone was turned off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller shuddered. Was it turned off because Camille's phone ran out of battery? Or...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A bad premonition inexplicably surged within her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stood up and began to search the bar. However, the bar was so noisy, with so many people, and the light kept flickering, she couldn't see clearly at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She finally found the bar manager, "My friend is missing. Can your bar help me broadcast a search for her?" Valda Theller said anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other party seemed to have heard a big joke, "Miss, your friend is also an adult, maybe she has already left. What do you think this place is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But my friend's phone suddenly turned off, and she's not in her seat. If she really had to leave suddenly, she could have waited for me for a while, or she could have left a note on the table." Instead of disappearing for no reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it possible that someone deliberately stood you up?" the other party said, looking at Valda Theller with a little sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, my friend is not that kind of person," Valda Theller replied confidently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter what she said, the bar manager said he was powerless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could only call 110, but from the moment she found out that Camille was missing until now, not even half an hour had passed. The police's suggestion to her was to continue searching, and there was no intention to send anyone to look for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller understood that in the eyes of the police, Camille was an adult, and it had only been half an hour since she disappeared. There was nothing to worry about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But her anxiety grew stronger and stronger. After all, this matter was too unusual. She had even checked the restroom and the entrance, but she did not see Camille. She had also asked the people around their table, but the people at the next table did not notice Camille and naturally did not know when she left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The feeling of fear became stronger and stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was full of anxiety. What should she do? Would something happen to Camille? If Camille really had an accident, every minute that passed would increase her danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who else could she turn to for help? Who could help her find Camille?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller tightly held her phone, her fingers trembling as she scrolled through her contacts. Suddenly, the name Brian Hart caught her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body trembled as if she had caught a life-saving straw, and she dialed the number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was Brian Hart, he would definitely have a way, right? If it was him...</p></div>
