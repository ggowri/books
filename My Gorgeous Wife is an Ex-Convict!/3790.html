        <h1>Chapter 3788</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your phone was off, and I couldn't find you, so I came here to try my luck and see if you were here." Veronica's voice trembled slightly as she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she had mentally prepared herself for his anger and perhaps even fury, when she actually saw him, the look in his eyes that kept people at a distance still made her heart feel like it was being stabbed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want from me?" Mason's voice sounded again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I... I don't want there to be any misunderstandings between us, so I wanted to find you and explain what happened at the hospital today." She steadied herself and spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's there to explain about the hospital?" He said nonchalantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's plenty!" She said urgently, "I really don't care about Daniel, I don't have any feelings for him anymore. I just don't want you to get into unnecessary trouble because of beating him up. The person I'm worried about is you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're really worried about me, then you could have left with me when I did. Why did you stay in the hospital with Daniel?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well...there was no one else around at the time, and I needed to find doctors and nurses to treat his injuries," she quickly replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And after that? After the doctors and nurses came, you still stayed with him? You waited until his injuries were treated and talked to him for a while before leaving the hospital?" Mason continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How did Mason know that she only left the hospital after Daniel's injuries were treated and she talked to him? Did he see everything?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." she opened her mouth, but didn't know how to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you wondering how I knew? Do you know how long I waited for you at the hospital entrance?" he said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He waited for her at the hospital entrance, hoping she would come out and tell him that he was the most important person to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But time passed by and she didn't show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He told himself that she would come out when he counted to 100.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even after counting to 10,000, she still didn't come out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he closed his phone, drove his car aimlessly on the streets of Emerald City, not knowing where to go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His emotions were once again in turmoil.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like the feeling he had when they first separated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought he would never experience that feeling again, but he did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought that by hypnotizing his memories, he could avoid feeling the pain of that emotion again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But reality made him feel it again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this punishment for him? Punishing him for not learning his lesson, even though he </span><span>had been hurt by Veronica before, he still rushed to her to get hurt again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I'm sorry..." She stammered, "I waited in the hospital until it was confirmed that Daniel's injury was not serious before leaving. I was afraid that he would really have a serious problem and you would get into trouble. I didn't mean to..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could finish her words, he suddenly interrupted her, "You don't need to explain anything to me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm telling you this because I don't want you to misunderstand. Daniel and I really don't have anything..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you really have something with him, it has nothing to do with me." He said coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of unease surged in Veronica's heart, "What do you mean by that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It means we're breaking up." He said these words in a cold tone, and there was no expression on his handsome face, only indifference.</span></p></div>
