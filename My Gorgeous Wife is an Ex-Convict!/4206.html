        <h1>Chapter 4204</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was a video, captured by a passerby. After the video was released, someone recognized the man being carried out of the car by medical staff, suspecting it was the former idol star Kit, who had previously announced his withdrawal from the public eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The news of Kit's absence from public events had also become widely known, and there had been no news about him since then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now suddenly appearing in a small town far from Emerald City naturally made people very curious about this news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially since a pregnant woman was being carried out of the car with Kit. However, her face was covered by her disheveled hair, and due to the angle, people couldn't see her clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, there were rumors online that Kit had suddenly decided to quit being a star because he had a child and wanted to get married early.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, some people thought otherwise. After all, Kit had withdrawn from the public eye after Tina's disappearance. Therefore, many people believed that Kit quit the entertainment industry because he loved Tina deeply and was too heartbroken by her disappearance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In short, there were all kinds of discussions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Emerald City, Chandler's secretary rushed into the CEO's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Hunter," the secretary called.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's cold gaze made the secretary shiver involuntarily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been working by Chandler's side for many years, but ever since Miss Stephenson disappeared, Mr. Hunter had changed completely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he used to exude composure and restraint, giving people the impression of a towering mountain, now he seemed like a sharp sword. Just getting close to him felt like being harmed by the sword's light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Hunter had changed too much in the past six months!</span></p></div>
