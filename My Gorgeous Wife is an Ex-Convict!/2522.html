        <h1>Chapter 2520</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the court session approached, Deer City's media outlets also reported the relevant content. The news went viral, becoming the talk of tMason Swansonty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Amber Mitchell's history with Herman Moss and George Gregory was brought up again. There were all sorts of comments online, including those who felt sorry for Herman Moss and those who thought George Gregory was unlucky for having his former girlfriend and his current wife in a lawsuit. To make matters worse, both were half-sisters. How complicated! Others sympathized with Amber Mitchell and hoped she could get justice for herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, some netizens said Amber Mitchell deserved it. She was George Gregory's fianc&eacute;e but seduced Herman Moss and was sent to the mental hospital. They found it exhilarating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell brushed off such comments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After experiencing so many things, she no longer cared about the opinions of people who did not matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she could think about was making Louise Mitchell pay&mdash;not only for sending her to a mental hospital but also for killing Herman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Herman&hellip; Herman was so nice, but Louise Mitchell killed him!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Herman, I&rsquo;ll get justice for you!" Amber Mitchell murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the day of the trial, reporters swarmed outside the courthouse. Amber Mitchell and the Moss family were all present. When Amber Mitchell got out of the car, the reporters swarmed at her, almost surrounding her and leaving her immobilized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, security guards at the courthouse helped block the reporters away, and she was able to enter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the courtroom, Amber Mitchell saw George Gregory in the gallery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory was dressed in a black suit today, and his handsome face was expressionless. When his eyes saw her, he only gave her a faint glance before he shifted his gaze away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell recalled what he had said that day in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had made an enemy out of him, and she would accept whatever the consequences were!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the trial started, Amber Mitchell saw her father, stepmother, and... Louise Mitchell at the plaintiff's table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Louise Mitchell looked well compared to her father and stepmother. She seemed confident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell stared at Louise Mitchell. Louise Mitchell must believe that George Gregory would save her this time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she would not give them what they wanted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The trial began. Lawyer Gan represented Amber Mitchell, and famous lawyers in Deer City helped the three members of the Mitchell family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Three lawyers represented each of the three defendants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the courtroom, the witnesses' testimonies steered clear of Louise Mitchell and established that Louise Mitchell was innocent. In the end, all the blame was directed at Mr. Mitchell and her stepmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two had been talked into protecting their youngest daughter, so they &lsquo;voluntarily&rsquo; confessed in court.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, their confession only stated that they &lsquo;mistakenly believed&rsquo; that their daughter was mentally ill and they wanted her to be treated in the hospital. They only transferred the money to the doctors and the nurses who took care of Amber Mitchell so that they could provide their daughter with better treatment. </p></div>
