        <h1>Chapter 291</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins took on a ghastly expression and angrily said, "This unfilial daughter was put in prison and ruined our family. Now she's going to ruin us again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he had gone through many connections and spent a lot of money to get to his position as a supervisor!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could he accept the fact that he was now back to being a regular employee?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Melinda Riley was furious too. She looked as if she was going to rush out and tear Grace into pieces after finding her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom and Dad, don't act on impulse. Sis has Jason behind her now. We should think about what we're going to do to her." Evelyn advised. After all, she had suffered a lot from Grace before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins and Melinda Riley thought about it and agreed. They then said, "What should we do now? Just suffer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll think it over," Evelyn said. She needed to think hard about how to deal with Grace and not let Grace play an increasingly important role in Brian's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, even if Jason got rid of Grace, Grace would probably take her place and become Brian's new girlfriend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must not let this happen!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina asked Grace out again and gave Grace the information she had obtained from her colleague, including the witness's full name, current address, occupation, and even his family members' names.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, there was information on how the witness had changed his name. It was still the surname &lsquo;You&rsquo;, but he changed his first name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, when your case happened, he was just a regular employee and had a girlfriend, but they broke up because he couldn't afford a house. Not long after the end of your case, he changed his name, left Emerald City, and bought a commercial-residential building in S City. He paid it off in full, which is a total of five million dollars!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina told her what she found, then hummed coldly before saying, "Unless he won the lottery, he wouldn&rsquo;t have so much money to buy a house and pay for it in full!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you get all this information? Just by asking your colleagues?" Grace asked, a little confused. After all, judging from the material, some things could not be asked just by making small talk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of the information was very private.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I asked my colleague for a general idea. Then, I gave the basic information to a private detective and asked the private detective to check it for me," Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Private detective?" Grace was shocked. Lina always seemed to take her case to heart. "Then the expenses..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're asking me about the expenses at a time like this?" Lina glared at her best friend. "The most important thing now is to get to the bottom of your case. Don't ask about the expenses."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, the expenses..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You weren't such a fussy person back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina said this, Grace smiled bitterly. Yes. Back in those days, she did not care much about money. Sometimes, when she and Lina were out having fun together, it did not matter who would spend more money, but now...</p></div>
