        <h1>Chapter 3274</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian furrowed his brow and glared at Jason. This was a matter from many years ago when he had been searching for the little girl who had saved him when he was a child. He had been relying on his memory to constantly search for a replacement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He will engage with someone as long as they have some features that resemble the appearance of a little girl he remembers from his memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the more he engaged in such relationships, the more it intensified his emptiness. Until one day, he met Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems so, you've had quite a few ex-girlfriends," Hadwin said, as if recalling the past. "Back then, I was the only one, but Lina was poisoned during childbirth. If you had that many, maybe you should start investigating and taking precautions now, so you don't end up being targeted again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's thin lips were tightly pursed. These ex-girlfriends were from so many years ago that he had almost forgotten what they looked like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, with Jason bringing it up like this, his heart began to feel uneasy again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the evening, after everyone had left, Valda looked at Brian's silent face and asked, "What did you guys talk about? You look so serious now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked at Valda and pursed his lips before speaking after a while. "They asked me to pay attention to certain things to prevent any accidents from happening in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Unexpected?" Valda paused for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm afraid you might encounter some danger when giving birth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda just realized that, come to think of it, it seems like Grace, Lina, and Kyla all had difficult childbirths.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm fine," Valda said. "The doctor said my test results were all good, and the baby's measurements are also good. Anyway, if the baby's position is really bad or if it's too big, we can always have a C-section."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her opinion, the risk of giving birth to this child was actually quite small. Furthermore, he had arranged for an experienced medical team, so even if there were some dangerous situations, she believed that those experienced medical professionals would be able to save her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not just that," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda blinked her eyes, "So what now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hesitated, with a hint of struggle in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? If you have something to say, just say it. Is there anything we can't talk about between us?" Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian said, "So... after you hear this, please don't get angry, okay? You're pregnant now, so even if you want to be angry or scold me, please wait until the child is born to do so, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he spoke, Valda's expression became serious and focused. Could it be that there was really something important going on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," she responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian took hold of Valda's hand and held it in his palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at the other person with a slight surprise, and only then did she realize that he was holding her hand and that his hand was actually quite cold at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After thinking for a moment, Valda raised her other hand and reached back to grab Brian's hand. "Go ahead and tell me, I'm listening. No matter what it is, I won't get angry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... when I was a child, I met Grace. Grace saved my life. As I grew up, I have been searching for Grace," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's eyes flickered, she already knew all of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Does what he's about to say next have to do with Grace?</p></div>
