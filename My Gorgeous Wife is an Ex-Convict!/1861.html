        <h1>Chapter 1859</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That&rsquo;s all the more reason why I want to go look for him!&rdquo; She wanted to find him as soon as possible and apologize to him. Otherwise, the misunderstanding would only deepen and they would become irreconcilable. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll get the driver for you," said Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace nodded. Though she had retaken her driver's license and could drive a car, she was not calm right now. It was indeed safer to let the driver drive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The driver drove Grace to Reed group's building first, but Jason was not inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace then told the driver to head to one of the mansions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she saw the driver taking a different route on their way there, so she could not help asking, "Why aren&rsquo;t you driving straight ahead?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The GPS says the road ahead is closed, so we have to take a detour," the driver replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's closed?" Grace shuddered. The road ahead... was where Jay's father died and where she first met Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The night she met Jay, he was standing by the roadside, blocking off the whole street!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Could Jay...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Drive toward the closed street!" ordered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The driver did what he was told. He turned around and headed to the closed street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Barricades had indeed been set up on this side of the street. Grace got out of the car, only to see a familiar car... It was Jay's car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Someone got down from the car, but it was not the person she wanted to see. It was Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence walked up to Grace and respectfully said, "Young Madam."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is Jay here?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, Young master Reed is right in front," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace took a deep breath and started to walk toward the closed street, but Terrence stretched out his hand to stop her. He said, "Young master Reed said he doesn't want anyone to disturb him tonight, so please go home, Young Madam."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace stretched out her hand and pushed Terrence's hand away. "I won't go back. Since he's up ahead, I'll go look for him. You can try stopping me if you want!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She spoke so imposingly. From the look on her face and the aura she exuded, Terrence knew that she was determined to go in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I can only stop her by force, but... this is Grace&mdash;the apple of Young master Reed's eye. No one would dare to use force against her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence could only watch Grace walk past the barricade and onto the empty street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Terrence, are you sure about letting her through?" a bodyguard asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We're dead meat whether we stop her or not. Since we're dead meat anyway, maybe Young Madam can turn things around if we let her through," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, Grace was probably the only one who could recover Young master Reed's mood and change his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace walked step by step toward the place where they first met. She gradually caught sight of a figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This time, he was not wearing shabby clothes like in the past. He was still wearing the black suit he wore during the day. It was almost as if he was about to melt into the night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She walked up to him and muttered, "Jay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It made him stiffen slightly. Moments later, he slowly looked up, and his cold yet gorgeous eyes instantly met her almond-shaped eyes.</p></div>
