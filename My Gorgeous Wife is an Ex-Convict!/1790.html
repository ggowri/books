        <h1>Chapter 1788</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace found it funny that both Jay and Brian asked her the same question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I won&rsquo;t ever regret it. If you hadn't pushed me away and thrown Mason to me, I would&rsquo;ve fallen. You saved Mason and me, so of course, I&rsquo;d save you. Even if it were someone else, I would&rsquo;ve done the same thing," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian smiled wryly. "You're still the same as when you were little. You had grasped my hand desperately back then too. I really miss that time..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But we have to grow up someday. People will always grow up," said Grace, also hinting that he should let go of the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">How could he not understand her hint?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian muttered, "Yeah, people will always grow up. Grace, you once said that even if I had found you sooner, you still wouldn&rsquo;t have fallen in love with me, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace froze. She met Brian's eyes, and her heart quivered slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes seemed to know what she was going to say, but he still wanted to hear her say it herself. It was as if he was begging for a reason to give up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe it was a good thing for him to give up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace nodded and said, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You still love him even though he ignored your case for the sake of Reed group back then?&rdquo; Brian asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm willing to forgive him because he loves me the most, and I love him the most too," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Forgive?" Brian smiled bitterly. "But I'll... never forgive him. Not just for standing on the sidelines and putting you in jail, but also..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His voice trailed off and he did not continue. There was no point in telling her now that Jason had meddled in their affairs, causing him to mistake Hua Stella as her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was Jason's fault at the beginning, but it was his own fault afterward!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, let's stop talking about that. You have an operation tomorrow. I got this from the temple. I hope it'll make your operation go smoothly," said Brian as he took out an amulet from his pocket and handed it to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at the amulet. She hesitated and said, "You didn&rsquo;t have to get me an amulet. I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian said, "Consider it as easing my guilt. You aggravated the condition of your hands when you saved me. I'll feel better if you have this amulet with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian said as he stepped forward and put the amulet in the pocket of Grace's hospital gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, I'll pray for your operation to go smoothly. After this, I'll be leaving Emerald City. I have a project overseas, and I probably won't be back for a few years. But... I'll also wish you health and happiness," muttered Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps after experiencing life and death, he was finally willing to bury some of the obsession at the bottom of his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No matter how unwilling he was, what he wanted most was for her to be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had saved him twice in his life, so... it was enough. It was really enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He slowly raised his hands and cupped Grace's bandaged hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace subconsciously tried to pull her hands back, but Brian said, "I won't do anything to you. I just want to... have a good look at your hands. Grace, think of it as fulfilling my wish, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His usually indifferent voice was now full of pleading. He sounded as though there was a lump in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was silent. She knew Brian was saying goodbye to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not pull her hands back. Brian held her hands, quietly looking at them. He would always remember these hands. No matter how many years would pass, even to the end of his life, he would never forget that they... had once grabbed him so tightly.</p></div>
