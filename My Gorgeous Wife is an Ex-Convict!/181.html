        <h1>Chapter 180</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Until I&rsquo;m satisfied,&rdquo; he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit on her lip as she lowered her eyelids. She stared at the glass of wine in his hand. The lights in the room reflected on her face, and her lightly fluttering lashes made her look indescribably pleasant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if he could read her mind, he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid that I&rsquo;ll take advantage of you once you&rsquo;re drunk? There are plenty of ways for me to get women. I don&rsquo;t need to use this sort of method. Besides, even if I were to do anything to you right here and now, nobody will bat an eyelid.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Fair enough.&rsquo; Grace mocked herself for overanalyzing things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took the wine glass and gulped it down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Bitterness and dry sweetness filled her throat as the wine flowed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not used to drinking wine. Back then, she would only drink champagne whenever she needed to socialize for work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, she was still Sean Stevens&rsquo;s girlfriend, thus nobody would force her to drink too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason refilled Grace&rsquo;s glass with more wine. She raised her head backward and downed the glass of wine again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like that, she drank glass after glass as if the wine was medicine. She was just hoping that he would be satisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for him, a smile was plastered on his face as if watching her drink was such a joyful thing to watch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Toward the end, Grace felt that her mind was in mess. She was having difficulty controlling her hands and feet. Even her voice began to stutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Join me for a drink...&rdquo; When her glass was once again filled to the brim with wine, she shakily presented the glass of wine in front of him with a bright smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her, he knew that she was now drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had seen her drunk once in the past. However, it was not the same as this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, he did not like anyone else touching the object of his game.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, his gaze was fully focused on her every smile and movement of her brows. He knew that she was drunk and that her behavior now did not carry any meaning, but he still asked, &ldquo;You want me to drink?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yup.&rdquo; She nodded her head firmly. &ldquo;Drinking alone... is so boring. Drink with me, please.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His brows lifted. Such a cutesy voice would never be heard when she was sober.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Say it again. Repeat what you said just now.&rdquo; He lifted his hand and brushed her lips with the tip of his finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Drink with me...&rdquo; she mumbled. Her almond eyes looked at him with a scarlet gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Okay...&rdquo; he softly replied. He used a pampering tone that he had never noticed before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took the glass from Grace and drank from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her smile shone brighter as she reached for the wine bottle to pour herself another glass. She was about to down that as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, he raised his hand to stop her. &ldquo;Sis, you&rsquo;re drunk. You don&rsquo;t need to drink anymore.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t need... to drink anymore?&rdquo; she mumbled, looking drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, you don&rsquo;t need to drink anymore.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But...&rdquo; She cocked her head to the side, trying to figure out what she missed out. After some time, she suddenly recalled. &ldquo;Then... Jason, will you release my... uncle and the rest?&rdquo;</p></div>
