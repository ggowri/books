        <h1>Chapter 1276</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, she looked around the room that was full of paintings. "I'm only an obsession for you. It was because of an agreement we had when we were little. That's why you've been looking for me all these years. That's how people are sometimes. The more they can't get it, the more they want it. They&rsquo;ll even begin to see everything through rose-colored lenses. But I'm nothing but ordinary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace spoke, she turned her head and looked at Jason who stood beside her. She lifted her free hand and placed it around his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face grew solemn. Those peach blossom eyes just watched as Grace stood on her tiptoes as she kissed him on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was taking the initiative to kiss him, and he accepted the kiss passively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes grew darker and darker. Then, he slowly closed his eyes and went along with her kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After an unknown amount of time, she finally finished the kiss and looked at Brian as she panted slightly. "Jay&rsquo;s the one in my heart. Brian, you've found me, so we've fulfilled our promise!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those dark phoenix eyes were gradually shrouded in despair. 'We've fulfilled... the promise... so... we have nothing to do with each other now...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he and she had all these years was only a promise...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was immediately shocked when she walked out of the main house of Brian's mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only see several rows of people standing around. They were obviously Jason's men. They all shouted &ldquo;Master Reed" when they saw Jason come out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The maids and security guards at Brian's mansion were being suppressed by these men, and they dared not move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's... a little too much.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you... bring so many people?" muttered Grace. 'No wonder he could barge into Brian's mansion like that.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason dragged Grace into the car without saying a word. Then, he said sternly to his men, "No one is allowed to come over!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car door closed with a bang, Grace and Jason were the only ones in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The backseat of the car was more spacious than regular cars, and Grace sat on her side with her back pressed against the side door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his hands on both sides of Grace's body, and his face was full of gloom. "You're so worried about Brian that you said those words on purpose for fear that he would still set his heart on you. You even made me put on a show in front of him with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since when was he reduced to putting on a show with someone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip slightly. She knew she could not hide her intentions from Jason and said, "Sorry." She apologized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sneered. "Sorry? Grace, aren't you a lawyer? Don't you hate lies the most? But you keep lying. Do you know how I felt when you kissed me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The first time she kissed him after they got married was because of Brian. How... ridiculous and pathetic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cold, angry look on his face made her shudder slightly. He had always been calm to her in the following days after their marriage. Never had he been so furious!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm so sorry. I just wanted Brian to stop being in love with me. I hope he'll let go of this obsession," said Grace. Her almond-shaped eyes looked up and did not avoid Jason's gaze. "But I didn't lie."</p></div>
