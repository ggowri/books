        <h1>Chapter 4072</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, what did Chandler say to you alone back then, and did Hunter sign the agreement in the end?" Tina was curious now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let Chandler tell you later," Hadwin obviously had no intention of telling his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can't you just tell me?" Tina looked at her father with wide eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Back then, I just believed what he said, so there are some things that he should tell you," Hadwin insisted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina looked disappointed, but she also understood that once her father made a decision, she wouldn't get any answers by asking more questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, today's conversation with her mother did give her some insight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least one thing is certain, Hunter's family doesn't plan on keeping her out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She will be Chandler's wife in the future, so she can enter Hunter's family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After her mother's words today, Hunter's mystery became even more apparent to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even though she had known Chandler for so many years, he rarely talked about their family matters. Even when he did mention them occasionally, it was always about something trivial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Does she really have to wait until she marries Chandler before she can go to their family's place?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Will there be any problems if we go there early?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several days passed, but Tina still hadn't come to a conclusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she casually mentioned to Chandler, "Chandler, can I go with you to your family's home this time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!" He refused without even considering it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why not? Didn't you say that I can enter your family's home after we get married? It's just going there early."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at her and said, "No means no. Absolutely not before we get married!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's in your family's home that I can't enter?" She was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he didn't seem to want to explain and just patted her head in a soothing manner, like he was calming down an angry kitten. "Be good. I'll bring you a gift later. Besides, there's nothing interesting in my family's home. There are a lot of rules, and it's very boring."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina pursed her lips. Did he really see her as a child?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Didn't he say he loved her? But at this moment, she felt like she would always be a child in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is an eight-year age difference really that big?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After leaving Chandler, Tina suddenly received a call from photographer Zabulon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina thought Zabulon was going to talk to her about the COS photos they took last time, but he called for something else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tina, do you want to collaborate with Kit?" Zabulon asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Collaborate?" Tina was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, last time you and Kit took some photos on the fly. Although they weren't selected in the end, they were highly regarded over there. They want to invite you and Kit to take a set of photos separately, which will be published in the magazine. You can consider it, but the time is tight. You need to give me an answer tomorrow," Zabulon said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "When will the shoot be? How long will it take?" Tina asked. She needed to make sure the shooting time wouldn't conflict with her classes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "The shoot will be next weekend, for about 8 hours a day," Zabulon replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Okay," Tina replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> There was nothing to consider. She was already a fan of Kit, and taking photos with her idol... well, that was something many fans would want to do.</p></div>
