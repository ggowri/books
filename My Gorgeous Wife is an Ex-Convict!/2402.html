        <h1>Chapter 2400</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was a bastard child for many years until Amber Mitchell's mother passed away. It was only then her mother succeeded in taking Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s place, which officially made her the second heiress of the Mitchell family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, she had always been ridiculed in high society.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not until Amber Mitchell was admitted to a mental hospital that she could hold her head high.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's face reddened, but she had no idea what to say all of a sudden. Whitney Herrera frowned a little after hearing &lsquo;the eldest heiress of the Mitchell family&rsquo;. After all, the person represented the Moss family's past scandal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that you know things, Mrs. Potter. How about I invite you and Mr. Zhang to come to my house sometime and help me see if the porcelain I bought some time ago is real?" George Gregory's voice suddenly rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expression of Mrs. Potter, who had mentioned the words just now, changed slightly before she said weakly, "I was just casually speaking. Don't mind it, Mr. Gregory."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Some things are better left unsaid," George Gregory said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, another voice rang out. "You're right. There are things you shouldn't say casually. Please tell that to your wife." Brian was the one who spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory looked up coldly to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled lightly and met his eyes. The two men confronted each other, and the tension seemed ready to explode.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although George Gregory had never talked to Brian, it did not mean that he did not know Brian. There was no need to make an enemy of Brian because of this remark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory was the first to stop being so cold and said calmly, "I do need to talk to my wife, lest she says anything she shouldn't and causes unnecessary misunderstandings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, George Gregory looked at Grace. "Since my wife misspoke today, I'll apologize to you, Miss Cummins. I&rsquo;ll you and Mr. Hart to dinner sometime."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said that out of politeness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace said, "Okay, I'll be waiting for the meal, Mr. Gregory."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Surprise flickered in Brian's eyes. After all, Grace had never liked such meals, unless she had other reasons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Brian said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory replied in acknowledgment before turning around and leaving with Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell gave Grace a resentful glare before she left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Brian and said, "Thank you for earlier, but why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled indifferently. "You could have handled it without me just now. I have a project in Deer City, so I flew here from abroad. I&rsquo;m at this party because there are some people I need to get to know here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you should go back to work. I won't keep you," said Grace. She was about to walk away from Brian when his hand suddenly grabbed her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't..." he cried out subconsciously with a hint of imploration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps he had not seen her for too long, so he longed for every minute he could have with her. He did not even want her to walk out of his sight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's footsteps paused while Whitney Herrera watched with a thoughtful look in her eyes. </p></div>
