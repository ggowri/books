        <h1>Chapter 3212</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lina, you're overthinking it. They're only a few years old," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't think too much," said Lina. "The Barlow family's child and Jasper have been childhood friends. He looks at Jasper with such a focused gaze that when they get a few years older, they'll probably start dating. Nowadays, kids start dating earlier and earlier every year."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Indeed, children nowadays mature early. I also think that William must really like Jasper," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah, if we find that little boy, it might turn into a love triangle in the future," Lina imagined various scenarios. "Grace, are you really planning to find that little boy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jason has promised the child, so he naturally has to find them. It's estimated that it will be within the next two days, and we can arrange for Jasper to meet the child," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Brian emerged from the bathroom wearing a bathrobe and walked over to Valda. "Are you still chatting?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without waiting for Valda's response, Lina's scream came through the phone, "Ah, the temptation of a bathrobe! I actually saw Brian in his bathrobe, oh my god..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, the tone of the conversation changed drastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, on Lina's screen, a hand covered her eyes and Hadwin's voice came through, "Sorry about that, my wife just lost her cool. I have some things to discuss with her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing, Lina disconnected from the video call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The others looked at each other in confusion. Grace smiled and said, "Alright, we won't disturb your honeymoon any longer. Let's end our conversation here for today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the video call ended, Valda turned to Brian and said, "I wonder how Lina is doing now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I reckon Hadwin will make sure she understands not to scream at other men." Brian bent down and lifted Valda horizontally, taking big steps towards the bed before setting her down. "What about you? Would you scream if you saw someone else's husband in a bathrobe?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda really started to think about it seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Think about Grace, Kyla, and Lina's husbands, they are all incredibly handsome. If they were in the entertainment industry, they would be top-notch. If they really appeared in bathrobes, then she...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He saw her serious expression and furrowed his brows. He leaned down and kissed her cheek, "Okay, stop thinking about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I have to think about it. How do I know if I will scream if they really wear bathrobes? I have to imagine it!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was at a loss and realized he had dug himself a hole.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop thinking about it. Just scream when you look at me in the future," he whispered, showering her with more kisses on her face, lips, and neck, causing her thoughts to shut down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All she could see was his face, and his breath surrounded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, are you jealous?" she finally blurted out after a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mm, I am jealous, and very jealous," he murmured, holding her hand tightly and bringing his lips close to her ear, "So, you must not scream at other men, don't make me look like a jealous husband, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His seductive voice was tempting her willpower!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay...I understand," she said, blushing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One night, she finally realized that men can be quite stingy sometimes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">***</p></div>
