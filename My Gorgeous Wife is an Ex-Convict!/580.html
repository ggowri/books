        <h1>Chapter 579</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were probably many people who wanted to throw stones at the person who had fallen down a well. Nevertheless, Grace did not sympathize with Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not the Holy Mother who would sympathize with someone who was bent on causing her trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why won't you let me announce that you're my girlfriend?" asked Jason; he had planned to go public about their relationship as a couple. He did not like people mistaking that she had something going on with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, Grace stopped him. "I don't want to make a big deal out of it, and I don't want to be on the news." She was not trying to hide the fact that they were dating anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, in the circle in which they lived, many people already knew about their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, once it was announced online, she would be in the news. A bunch of people would probably come to the small restaurant to see her then. Additionally, she would be surrounded by people whenever she delivered food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, because of her imprisonment, she would suffer even more criticism, especially since the victim was Jennifer Atkinson, Jason&rsquo;s ex fiancee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could be indifferent to the criticism against her, but she could not be indifferent to the criticism against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she had reversed the case, people would probably harbor all kinds of malicious speculations about their relationship. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said thoughtfully, "I'll protect you. If you don't want to be on the news, then I'll ask all the media groups in Emerald City not to bother you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not afraid, Jay. I know that since we're dating, the public will come to find out about us one day," said Grace. After all, he was Jason, he was the famous Young Master Reed of Emerald City. "My case can't be hidden. They can find out about it through the court, the police, and the prison system. If it is made public, it will not only impact us but also the Reed family. After all... In terms of the judge's ruling, the person I 'killed' was Jennifer Atkinson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't care," Jason said. Gossip was a fearful thing, but it would not affect people like him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was even strong enough to control the so-called "gossip".</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I do," said Grace. Before this, she had wanted to reverse the case to clear her name and find the real culprit who had the intention of harming her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, more than anything else, she now wanted to reverse the case in hopes that there were no misunderstandings, sore points, and nothing to be maliciously speculated about between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to be with him in a clean way, untainted by her criminal record.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyelashes quivered a little as he lowered his eyes slightly and hugged Grace. "I'll reverse the case for you. You don't have to worry about anything. It won't be long before no one will be able to use the case to criticize you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would clear her name for her, even if... it was more than 3 years too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. "It won't be too long? Is there something new to the case?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, there is something but more evidence needs to be gathered. Don't worry, it'll be settled soon," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face lit up. "Thank you, Jay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if his heart had been stung by her thanks. Did she know that he was one of the worst people she could thank?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only hoped that she would never know about it. The reason being, if she knew, the price would probably be too great for him!</p></div>
