        <h1>Chapter 2631</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian came to Valda Theller's studio on the weekend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The studio was not large, only about one hundred square meters in total. However, the furnishing was simple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were some comic posters on the walls. Judging by the style, she must have been the creator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The shelves against the wall were filled with comic books, including hers. However, most of them seemed to be short comics. The one he had seen that day was a short comic book as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've been drawing comics since high school," he said. At least that was what was written in her profile when he investigated her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not exactly since high school. I enjoyed drawing comics since I was young. I was a Year 3 senior in high school when I submitted my manuscript. I didn't expect my first submission to be successful. I continued in this line of work until now.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Year 3? You must&rsquo;ve sat for your National College Entrance Examination at the time. You would&rsquo;ve had a lot of homework," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I tried to draw in my spare time. Sometimes I drew into the wee hours. But there's no substitute for the satisfaction of seeing your comics in magazines," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you find it hard? And comics aren't a popular industry in China. You can't make much money from it," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Although I won't become very rich, at least I can earn a living. Besides, my life has been getting better over the years. I used to do it all by myself, but then I opened a studio and now I have two assistants. It's still a small studio, and I'm not that famous, but I think it's good to be able to do what I love and still make a living. Contentment is bliss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she spoke, she was smiling, and stars seemed to be shining in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Contentment is bliss?' Brian's eyes glimmered slightly. Not many people could fulfill those simple three words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Most people wanted more and more and could never be satisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't you going to draw me today? Are we going to start now?" Brian asked as he changed the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah, let's start now," Valda Theller said quickly before asking Brian to sit on the couch while she set up the easel and drawing board. She then took out the pencil for sketching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sit as you please. It'll take more than an hour. Is that okay?" Valda Theller asked after estimating the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he said before sitting in what he thought was a comfortable sitting position.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared at Brian and suddenly said, "Can you loosen your tie a little? It&rsquo;ll look better that way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was sitting a little languidly now, but his crisp suit and tie made him look slightly more serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His slender fingers tugged at the neat tie, and Valda Theller instantly felt like she was watching a big-budget film.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was too bad that this guy was not a celebrity. If he were in a commercial, he would be popular.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tie was tugged a little looser, making him look slightly more casual. "Will this do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes!" She nodded immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's fingers unbuttoned the top button of his shirt. One instantly got a better view of his neckline, and one could see part of his collarbone. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller felt that her eyes seemed to be glued to the man in front of her. 'Is this considered a bonus?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The urge to draw him grew stronger.</p></div>
