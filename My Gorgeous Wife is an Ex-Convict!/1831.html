        <h1>Chapter 1829</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He suddenly staggered and put one hand on the edge of her bed as if he had no energy left to remain standing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Am I so unworthy of your trust?" he murmured. He looked at her with eyes that seemed to be filled with great pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The pain was so overwhelming that Lina's heart instantly clenched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though she had planned to cut ties with this man in front of him, there was no way to stop the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Ignore it. It&rsquo;s just my illusion. Even if he does have a bit of love for me, it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore. It's the end of him and me. Everything ends here. I don't want to be fooled by him again and again!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I won't believe a word you say." She heard her own voice say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really?" His lashes quivered slightly as his cold fingertips slid gently across her lips. "Are you sure you won't regret getting rid of our baby and having nothing to do with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She felt as if her lips had gone cold. His cool fingertips seemed to freeze her blood. "I won't regret it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Yeah, I won't regret it.' She had already made up her mind when she was in the emergency room being examined by the doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The baby seemed to be cooperating with her since their heartbeat was too faint, as if they wanted to leave as well. Even if she did not have an abortion, the baby would probably leave her in a few days anyway!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stared at Lina. Then, he slowly withdrew her hand and closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, since you won't regret it, then... I won't regret it either," he muttered, slowly straightening up as he finished his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He moved slowly as if he was using all his strength to try and stand upright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He slowly opened his eyes and looked condescendingly at the woman on the hospital bed. The overwhelming pain in his dark eyes had disappeared and turned into indifference. "Well then, do as you wish, Lina. It's okay if you don't want this baby. From now on, I have nothing to do with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Hadwin Stephenson turned and left the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina stared blankly at Hadwin Stephenson's leaving figure. Her tears finally fell from her eyes when she could no longer see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Why... did her heart hurt? This was what she wanted! He really had nothing to do with her now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The final look he gave her showed her that he meant what he said, and he would keep his word!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she was not happy at all. She felt as if a piece of her heart had been taken away. It made her so upset that she could not stop her tears no matter what...</p></div>
