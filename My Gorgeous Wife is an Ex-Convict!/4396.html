        <h1>Chapter 4394: The Possibility of Being Abandoned</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, does this mean that he and she can't even be friends?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he had known this would be the outcome, he wouldn't have told the truth earlier. He could have made up an excuse and denied it outright. With his acting skills, he should have been able to put on a convincing performance without her suspecting a thing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... can I really lie to her?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he heard her say that she wanted the truth, he realized he hadn't even thought about lying!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvert, how can you be so delusional!" He mocked himself, his words filled with bitterness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the following days, Calvert didn't see Harley again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's as if she suddenly vanished from his world.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's up, glued to your phone?" The voice of his agent echoed in his ear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing." Calvert put away his phone. At this moment, he didn't even have the courage to dial Harley's number, fearing that after dialing, all he would hear is a notification that he's been </span><span>blocked</span><span> and the call can't get through.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Also afraid to hear Harley's cold voice.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway, even though she said she needed to think about whether we could still be friends, the fact that she hasn't given any answer these days probably means she's made her decision, right?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as expected, she doesn't even want to be friends with him anymore!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps for her, his affection for her was nothing more than a deception and a desecration!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, you have a fashion show tomorrow. Do you want to send an invitation to Miss Hart?" the agent asked. She was </span><span>well aware</span><span> of the friendly relations between Harley and Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, as an agent, I'd want to leverage this relationship. After all, if Harley makes an appearance at Calvert's fashion show, it </span><span>would</span><span> create more buzz and bring in better resources.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need!" Calvert said, "From now on, don't involve Miss Hart in everything. She and I... we're not related in any way."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Did something happen between you and her?" the agent asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing happened," Calvert said, "I just don't want you to take advantage of my past relationship with Miss Hart."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you say I'm taking advantage? It should be you who's using me, after all, you're the one who wants to climb up the ladder, right? Only then can you be worthy of the Hart family's eldest princess, isn't it?" the agent said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was taken aback for a moment, looking at his agent in disbelief, "How could you..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm your agent, do you really think I wouldn't notice?" The agent teased, squinting his eyes, "But these past few days, you seem to have lost touch with Miss Hart. Don't tell me you've been dumped."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A look of embarrassment and awkwardness flashed across Calvert's face.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The agent's face changed, it seemed that it was really the case.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Calvert really gets dumped by Harley, then he probably won't be able to use Harley's name to find better resources in the future!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Calvert is doing well in the industry now, some even predict that if he continues to hone his acting skills, he might have a shot at becoming a leading actor in the future.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for her, the most important thing is figuring out how to make more money off Calvert!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that Calvert has lost Harley as a backer, he needs to find another one!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, all you need to do is behave yourself, and I'll naturally find a way!" The agent patted Calvert's shoulder and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days later, Calvert could sense a change in the way some people looked at him. He even overheard some whispers about him behind his back.</span></p></div>
