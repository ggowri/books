        <h1>Chapter 809</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"An outsider. A... former friend, but we're not in touch anymore," Grace said with a wry smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter said thoughtfully, "You'll have to thank your friend. Without this person, you wouldn't be able to go back to working as a lawyer now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was relieved when she got out of Lawyer Carter's office. To be honest, she was worried that her new boss would insist on finding out who had helped her to reverse the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back at her desk, Grace started getting used to the task at hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had also worked as an assistant for half a year when she first joined the industry. She could adapt to the job quickly now that she was back at it. It may be a bit trivial, but it was not difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz sauntered up to her desk to say hello and beat around the bush about Jason, which Grace ignored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the end of the day, Grace was about to leave when Andrea Schwartz said, "Hey, Grace has just joined us today. How about we hold a welcoming party for our new colleague?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone chimed in at once, "Yeah, yeah! Let's welcome our new colleague!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's rare to have a woman join us. We must welcome her well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was too embarrassed to refuse. After all, she was a newcomer, and some socializing was necessary. If she did not fit in on her first day, she would find it hard to stay in this job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, networking mattered for lawyers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, even though it was Andrea Schwartz who suggested it, which was clearly a hostile move, Grace had no choice but to agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, she was also guessing what Andrea Schwartz was trying to do. Surely, she did not genuinely mean to throw her a welcoming party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only applied for the position of an assistant, so the so-called welcome party was only attended by the inexperienced lawyers of the firm and staff members who were in the same assistant position as Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there were a dozen of them as well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only when they reached their destination that Grace realized they had come to Drunken Days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Drunken Days was one of Emerald City's better-known high-end entertainment venues and was usually a place for the wealthy. Although lawyers had a pretty good income, those who could afford this place were the firm's several bosses and best lawyers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, under Andrea Schwartz's leadership, the crowd got into the private room and started ordering all sorts of things that were on the menu.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace narrowed her eyes slightly, and a vague unease rose in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the dishes arrived, Grace estimated that it would cost at least tens of thousands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if everyone went dutch, each of them would probably have to pay 6,000 or 7,000 dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although this figure was bearable for these colleagues, it was too much for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this what Andrea Schwartz is planning to do?' Grace thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now that the food was served, there was no point for her to say or do anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had 6,000 to 7,000 thousand dollars on hand, but after she paid for this meal, she would have to tighten her belt and pinch her pennies.</p></div>
