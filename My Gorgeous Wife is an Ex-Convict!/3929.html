        <h1>Chapter 3927</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This slap made her stagger back two steps before she barely regained her balance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her cheek was burning with pain. Nancy looked up at Clarissa, who was standing in front of her. This woman was still the same, always slapping her when they met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If before, she had been accommodating to Clarissa in order to make her mother's life easier, now she had no such concerns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Clarissa was the one who killed her mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You bitch, are you spreading rumors everywhere..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's words were cut off by a crisp slap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, it was Nancy who slapped Clarissa directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa was shocked, holding her slapped cheek. "You...how dare you hit me?!" Her expression was as if she never expected Nancy to fight back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy spoke coldly, "Why wouldn't I hit you? Since you slapped me first, it's only fair that I hit you back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, who do you think you are? I hit you because I wanted to. You're just a lowly servant who wouldn't be eating anything but rotten food in the slums if it weren't for the Schultz family!" Clarissa cursed loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, the Schultz family raised me, so I endured all the mistreatment from you. I served you like a servant, enduring your insults and criticisms. But Clarissa, my mother married into the Schultz family with dignity. My mother raised me in the Schultz family, so I don't owe you anything!" Nancy's eyes were incredibly cold as she looked at Clarissa. "It's you who killed my mother. Why are you here causing trouble again today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her words seemed to remind Clarissa, who immediately glared at Nancy with hatred. "Your mother fell on her own. What does that have to do with me? You slut, if it weren't for you spreading rumors outside, Mick wouldn't have mentioned your mother's death in front of my dad and warned me about it. What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was taken aback. Mick had mentioned that he would help her talk to the Schultz family, but she thought he was just saying it casually. She didn't expect him to actually do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, you came to pick a fight with me?" Nancy asked. "If I told Mick that you were the one who killed my mother, and I wanted him to help me make you pay, make you go to jail, and make you pay for my mother's life, would you believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing Clarissa's face turn pale after hearing her words, Nancy felt a sense of pleasure that she had never felt before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She could feel Clarissa's fear, but it wasn't fear of her, it was fear of Mick that she was using to intimidate Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, how pathetic was it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had always resented the unfairness of the world, resented those wealthy people who were high and mighty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the end, she was using Mick, who was richer and more powerful than the Schultz family, to scare Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you really tell Mick?" Clarissa's face turned white.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Guess." Nancy gave an ambiguous answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You slut, do you think Mick will help you? Who do you think you are? You want Mick to help you deal with the Schultz family!" Clarissa raised her hand again, wanting to hit Nancy's face.</p></div>
