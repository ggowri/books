        <h1>Chapter 2663</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had previously told Camille that she was not a celebrity and was unlikely to be recognized in such a remote place even if a post about her had gone viral.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not help worrying when Brian asked her to dine with him. She was worried that someone would recognize her when she dined with him. He would suffer if it caused a ruckus. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller bought some vegetables, seasonings, and rice in the supermarket. She would be spending the next few days in the apartment anyway. She could have enough to last her a few days if she bought more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting back to the apartment, she washed the rice and cooked it with a rice cooker. Then, she washed and cut the vegetables and meat she bought and began to cook.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was still cooking when Brian arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Give me a second. I have one more soup to prepare. Dinner will be ready once it's done," said Valda Theller as she asked Brian to sit down first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could see the entire 400-square-feet apartment unit in one glance. Brian sat at the dining table and watched Valda Theller cook in the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She skillfully put the ingredients and seasoning into the pot. One could tell that she usually cooked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were already four dishes on the table right now. They were only regular home-cooked dishes, but they looked good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once the soup was ready, Valda Theller served the soup at the dining table. "How much rice do you want? I'll go get it for you," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just one regular bowl," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not need to come. They did not plan to go out on a date today. However, when they talked on the phone, he was worried she would overthink if she was left alone. Therefore, he decided to take her to dinner. He even agreed to come here for dinner in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even if she does overthink, it shouldn't concern me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or is it because we're dating? She's my girlfriend right now. Even if I don't love her, I should do what a normal boyfriend would do at the very least, right?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller soon served the hot rice to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go ahead. I wonder if these dishes are to your taste," Valda Theller said sheepishly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian picked a dish and took two bites. It did not taste very good to him. After all, he frequented fancy restaurants, and the Hart family had superb chefs. Valda Theller's cooking was no match for them, of course.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, looking at the sparkle in her round eyes, he said, "Pretty good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She instantly smiled, and the sparkle in her eyes became brighter. It was as if his simple remark had given her great satisfaction. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How... easily satisfied!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian sighed to himself. &lsquo;Would my life be easier if I were as easily satisfied as she is?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller also du into the food she prepared. Suddenly, she seemed to think of something and asked, "By the way, did I do anything I shouldn't have done after falling asleep when you sent me home that day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should be asking if I did something that I shouldn't have to you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked and looked blankly at him. "Even if you did do something to me, you got the short end of the stick." She only realized what she had said after speaking. She then blushed immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh, what did I just say?'</p></div>
