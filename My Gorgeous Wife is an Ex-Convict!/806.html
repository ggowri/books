        <h1>Chapter 805</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's because she was only imprisoned for three and a half years. It was too light a sentence! Too light!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, why did I stop her when I saw her hurting herself? Why did I call an ambulance?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;m supposed to get back at her, but in the end, I feel like she&rsquo;s the one taking her revenge on me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His phone rang particularly loudly in this quiet space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at the caller ID and saw that it was Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin." When he answered, Paisley Daniels's soft voice came from the other end of the call. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" asked Martin Weiss, but there was exhaustion in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you tired?" Paisley Daniels asked quickly, recognizing the difference in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine. I'm just busy with some small matters," he said. 'Yes, Kyla is just a small matter to me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then&hellip; Then I won't bother you anymore. I just want to know when you'll be back. If you need to stay in Emerald City a little longer, then I'll come and accompany you," said Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Knowing that he had been staying in Emerald City and that every time she called, he would only say a few words to her made her feel uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if something would happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he was nice to her all these years and they were planning to get married... The fact that she could not conceive and bear a child remained a thorn in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides... What concerned her most was that she knew he had been looking for her all year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does Kyla hold some importance&hellip;' Paisley Daniels did not dare to think of it any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that what she had to do now was to hold on to Martin and marry into the Weiss family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, you needn't come. I'll be back in a couple of days," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Martin Weiss finished the call, his eyes fell on the closed door of the operating room again. His expression looked conflicted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What should I do with Kyla?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Should I continue with my revenge?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I don't even know what the answer is!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla woke up, she caught sight of her mother's worried face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was startled immediately. "Mom!" As soon as she opened her mouth, her throat was dry and she felt a pain in her stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't move. Just lie down," Mrs. Corbyn said quickly, her eyes showing deep sadness. "How can you be so cruel? You stabbed yourself with a broken glass. Have you ever thought about how Nelson and I would go on with our lives if something happened to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she heard Nelson's name, Kyla tensed immediately and turned her head as if she was afraid that Martin Weiss would suddenly appear and hear this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn patted her daughter's shoulder in comfort. "Don't worry, Martin Weiss has left. He's the one who called me to come to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He... left?" Kyla was stunned for a moment. Then, the strained nerves in her body seemed to relax, and she just lay on the hospital bed like she had melted into a puddle of mud.</p></div>
