        <h1>Chapter 3260</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda spent a while vomiting in the bathroom, but finally stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a deep breath and came to the sink to rinse her mouth and wipe her lips. Then she looked at herself in the mirror, her face pale and unattractive. If Brian saw her like this, he would worry again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, she didn't have any makeup tools with her to touch up her appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda touched her face and then walked out of the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as she stepped out of the restroom, Valda saw Brian rushing towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian..." she started, but the next moment, he had already pulled her into a tight embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He held her so tightly that she could feel his body trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was taken aback and heard whispers and gasps from the people around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong, Brian? Did something happen?" Valda asked, wondering why he was shaking like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm just glad you're okay and you're here," Brian gasped in relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...of course I'm here. Where else would I go?" Valda was confused, but then she realized something and asked, "Did you think something happened to me when you saw my seat was empty?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian remained silent, feeling a bit ridiculous that he panicked when he saw her seat was empty. He even considered closing down the whole restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, he regained his senses and remembered that Valda had a bodyguard who was responsible for her safety. He called the bodyguard to find out where Valda was and rushed towards the restroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His silence now seemed to be telling her the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda also fell silent, feeling more heartache than surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did her past incident leave too much of a shadow on him? So much so that when she just went to the bathroom to vomit and left for a while, he would worry and become afraid like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry..." Valda raised her hand and hugged Brian back. "Next time, if I have to leave for a while, I'll call you so you won't worry so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He paused for a moment and murmured, "Don't you think I'm overreacting?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can only feel that you love me too much," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His trembling finally subsided.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, let's go eat porridge. I'm so hungry," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Brian responded and then released the embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even now, Valda realized that many customers around the restroom were watching them!</p></div>
