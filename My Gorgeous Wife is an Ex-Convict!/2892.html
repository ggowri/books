        <h1>Chapter 2890</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He clenched his jaw and felt his teeth ache. 'Yeah, she&rsquo;s broken up with me. She has every right to find a new boyfriend, but... the thought of her smiling at another man, and kissing and hugging him makes me uncomfortable.&rsquo; Brian could not help feeling irritated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't find one! Do you think you can find another man like me to love when you love me so much?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller retorted with a slightly red face, "You... You're too confident. Who are you to say I can't find one? I love you now, but I can slowly get over you. Besides, I don't need to find a man like you in the future. I just need to find an ordinary man with a good personality who treats me well! I&rsquo;ll give him all my heart, and he&rsquo;ll do the same!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was more like she was telling herself that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, I can move on from him. I can do it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her words seemed to have provoked him as he turned the steering wheel sharply, slammed on the brakes, and pulled over at the roadside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was thrown forward and would have hit her head on the windshield if she had not worn a seat belt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she knew it, he had unbuckled his seatbelt and leaned toward her. His fingers grabbed her jaw as his lips pressed heavily on hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Umm..." She pressed her lips together tightly and tried to push him away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was so firm that she could not move him at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They kissed, and the two seemed to be competing on who was more patient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The familiar scent and temperature seemed to bewitch her. Her willpower and resistance seemed to soften gradually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His kiss continued to deepen. After a long time, he finally stopped the kiss. "Can you really fall for someone because he has a good character and treats you well? Valda, you love me. There's no way you'll fall for anyone else!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared at the handsome face in front of her. He was elegant and mature. He was also a rich heir. Few women could resist him when his phoenix eyes gazed at them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... "Everyone loves differently. Some people might only love one person in their life and can't change it, just like how you love Grace. No matter how hard you try to change, it&rsquo;ll end up in vain. Some people might love like me, and they can move on with time. Just like how I liked Raymond Bowman back in university, but I don't have any feelings for him now," she said bitterly. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian&rsquo;s expression began to turn ghastly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath. "So I can get over you, Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You could get over Raymond Bowman because you didn&rsquo;t have deep feelings for him! Valda, you can't let go of your feelings for me!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze. She felt embarrassed for a moment as if Brian was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you? Your feelings for Grace are deep. Can you get over her?" Valda Theller asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together for a long while before saying, "I'll get over her if you give me enough time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said, "But I can't afford it. You can say that I'm afraid of giving all the time I have and finding out ultimately that it's all for nothing. I&rsquo;ll really be devastated if that happens!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gazed deeply at him. "Brian, maybe what you need is someone else to fall in love with, but it won't be me."</p></div>
