        <h1>Chapter 631</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Jason and the rest entered the meeting room, someone from the front desk walked up to Andrea Schwartz. "Give me your phone, Andrea. I'll copy the recording."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why should I?" Andrea Schwartz clutched her phone tightly. She was not a fool. How could she give such evidence against herself to others?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he looked at her as if he was looking at a fool. "Because that person is Jason. Count yourself lucky that you only have to hand in the recording on your phone. As long as you keep your mouth shut, Grace probably won't do anything, but if you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man had not finished his sentence when he was interrupted by Andrea Schwartz's cry. "What did you say? That man is Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Jason is here today with Grace to reverse her case!" the man said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz looked shocked, her eyes almost bulging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason... How is it possible that Grace's boyfriend is Jason? It was Jason's fianc&eacute;e that Grace ran over and killed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He even wants to reverse her case?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does that mean Grace isn&rsquo;t the perpetrator?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Andrea Schwartz felt her mind go blank. The pain in her swollen cheeks, which had been burning, now turned into bitter coldness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Jason came to the meeting room. The meeting was attended by people Grace knew, including the boss of the firm and the lawyer she worked under when she first joined the firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only now they were looking at her with curiosity and caution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew it was because of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not say anything nor did she talk to them about the old days. She merely looked at the appeal statement that was filed by the firm, which contained descriptions of all the new evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Among the new evidence were several witnesses from that year. Grace had no idea that Jason managed to track down all of them. They pointed out that they had received money from one person to give false testimonies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the physical evidence, someone had bribed someone in the police station to tamper with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All the leads pointed out by the new evidence fell on one person&mdash;A man called Dexter Rios.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who&rsquo;s Dexter Rios?" she could not help but ask. She did not know this person! Why would this person go out of his way to put her in prison for such a crime?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's the former vice president of Atkinson Group and was close to Jennifer Atkinson. On the day of the incident, he and Jennifer Atkinson had a drink together. Jennifer Atkinson then left in her car, but she crashed into your car and had an accident. He was afraid that things would be traced to him and he would have to take responsibility for it, so he put all the blame on you. After you were put to prison, he quit his job as vice president and went abroad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason explained to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if he did have a drink with Jennifer Atkinson, it was Jennifer Atkinson who drove under the influence. Even if he was somewhat responsible for it, it wouldn&rsquo;t be that big of a deal." There was no need to go to the trouble to frame her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, it's nothing if the accident happened to ordinary people. Too bad it happened to Jennifer Atkinson," said Jason.</p></div>
