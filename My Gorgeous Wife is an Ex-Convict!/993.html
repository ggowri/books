        <h1>Chapter 992</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then just pretend I don't care about you," she said, lifting him from the tile floor with all her might. She half-dragged him to the bed and lay him down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was obviously uncomfortable as he immediately curled up like a shrimp on the bed. His handsome face twisted slightly with pain while his teeth were chattering. He was pressing his hands against his stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly realized that she had seen him having stomach cramps in front of her before. 'Is it possible that he&rsquo;s having a severe stomach ache?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Come to think of it, it's possible. After all, he seems to have drunk a lot today, especially when he drank with Brian. He must have been drinking... on an empty stomach. I didn't see them eating anything earlier.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is your stomach hurting?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together and made no reply. However, those bright peach blossom eyes of his kept looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I call Terrence to take you to the hospital?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He spoke with some difficulty, "No thanks. Don't you have no feelings for me and don't want me? Don't you... hate me? Then you ought to be... glad that I'm in such pain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Glad?' Grace looked at the man in front of her. He looked pale and fragile, and there was a lingering hint of despair on his handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not feel any pleasure in seeing him like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I'm not you. Even if I don't love, don't want, or even hate someone, I wouldn't want to take pleasure in someone else's pain! If you don't want me to call Terrence, then wait for me here. I'll go to the nearby pharmacy to get you some medicine!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She then took her keys and phone before hurrying out of the rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was alone again in the tiny rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason closed his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why am I not happy at all even after what she said? She&rsquo;s gone out to get some medicine for me, but that's only because she pities me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The stomach ache was getting more and more uncomfortable for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It hurt more than before, and when combined with the discomfort of being drunk, he felt empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who in the world would really want me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His mother had not wanted him as he was only a tool to bring her honor and wealth. Once the tool failed to do its job, then it could be discarded easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His father had not wanted him as well. Even though his father loved him, his love for him was nothing compared to his love for his mother. Therefore, his father was so disheartened that he killed himself and forgot that he had a child left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His grandfather did not want him for he was just a &lsquo;b*stard&rsquo; who carried half of the Reed family's bloodline. He had never accepted his mother to this day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was just a tool to carry on the Reed family's bloodline, but this tool was somewhat useful, so he ended up inheriting the Reed family's business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now... Grace... Grace doesn't want me either!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he was keeping her beside him as his sister, she still did not want him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't love me anymore... so you don't want me..." he murmured. The pain in his body was becoming more and more intense. Not only his stomach, but his heart and bones were also hurting... Even every breath he took hurt...</p></div>
