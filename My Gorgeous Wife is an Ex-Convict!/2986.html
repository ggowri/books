        <h1>Chapter 2984</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I value my girlfriend very much and don't want her to worry too much. So today, by accepting this interview, I also want to tell everyone that I hope this matter will end here." Brian's dark eyes looked at the camera. "As for how many people want to offer me an umbrella, I will only accept hers. For me, she is the one I want to spend my life with."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When these words were spoken, not only the host, but also the people on the scene and many others watching outside the screen were all stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This statement is like a marriage proposal!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Oh my goodness, really? A woman dressed in the most ordinary clothes has become the woman that the prince wants to spend his life with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This makes it unbearable for those female celebrities in the entertainment industry who are desperately trying to climb up the social ladder by getting close to the prince.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In front of the screen, Valda's eyes became moist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He still remembers, remembers tMason Swansonrcumstances of their first meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And the things he said... So, the reason he agreed to this interview today was also for her, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid that she would get hurt, so he used this method to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This man didn't say anything to her, but silently did everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said he would shield her from all the storms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And he really did!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The interview program had ended, but Valda seemed to still be immersed in it, unable to snap out of it for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It wasn't until the sound of the door being pushed open that Brian walked into the room, and she suddenly woke up and stood up as if startled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, you're not asleep yet? Were you waiting for me?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda stared at him blankly, then suddenly ran over and hugged him tightly, burying her face deeply in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong?" he asked, lowering his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I just watched your interview program," she said, her voice choking up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He immediately understood, "I'm sorry, I should have told you before that I accepted this interview program, but...I also had a bit of selfishness. I wanted to use this program to tell the public about us dating. Will you be mad at me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," she said, "Didn't you also ask me if I minded telling others that I'm your girlfriend? I said I didn't mind, didn't I? I just...just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice was hesitant, and the sound of her choking was even more apparent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just what?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just feel like you've done so much for me, and I... don't know how to repay you." It seemed like he was always protecting her, always sacrificing for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You already are repaying me," Brian said softly, holding Valda's face and looking at her red eyes. He felt a pang of heartache. "If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be who I am now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps he would still be stuck in the despair of his feelings for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Valda had given him happiness and helped him let go of his past burdens.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you've done so much, and I..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've done even more than I have," Brian said, lowering his head and kissing her red eyes. "Valda, I want to see you happy. I want you to be happy when you're with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's lips curved into a smile. "I'm happy, Brian. I'm very happy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She leaned up and kissed his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With him around, she will always be happy!</p></div>
