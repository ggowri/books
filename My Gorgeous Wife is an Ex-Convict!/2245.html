        <h1>Chapter 2243</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss was now donating 400ml of blood every month!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you realize that your body won&rsquo;t be able to take it if you keep doing this?!" She glared at him, feeling a surge of anger rising from her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not even know what she was angry about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she mad that he was donating blood to her without telling her? Was she mad that he did not cherish his own body? Perhaps it was something else...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what?" he asked indifferently as he looked at her gently. "Kyla, this is all I can do for you. I know it's hard for you to trust me right now, but... more than anyone else, I want this baby to be safe. And I want to make sure you have everything you need."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He paused again. "It's just 400ml each month. It's not a big deal. I&rsquo;ll take good care of my body and cherish it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides his blood, he also had his liver... His liver was important as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If her condition worsened, he could give her back her liver and let the doctors give her a second liver transplant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he would take better care of his health during this period than anyone else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Kyla's nose suddenly turned sore, and the soreness spread from the tip of her nose to her chest, then to her limbs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even her eyes turned red. She felt like she was about to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I've given you all the answers you wanted. Is that all?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lip slightly. "No matter what, I don't want you to get your blood drawn every month. It's too dangerous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "I&rsquo;m aware of the risks. Don't worry, I won't do anything harmful to my health."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." She wanted to add something else, but he cut her short.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you try to stop me again, I'll think that you care and are concerned about me." Martin Weiss's eyes darkened. "Kyla, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The words &lsquo;do you?&rsquo; made Kyla's heart tremble!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Do I? Do I care about him? Am I concerned about him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla subconsciously wanted to deny it. "I just don't want you to be in any danger because of me. And I've made it very clear that we don't owe each other anything. You don't have to prepare everything for me in such a way just because you feel bad for me," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, she told herself that this must be it. She did not want him to get his blood drawn for her because she did not want to owe him any favors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss smiled but tasted bitterness in his mouth. "Don't worry. You won't owe me anything. I'm the one who owes you, and I'm not doing it out of guilt!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would not let himself die if it was just guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was only willing to do this because he loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You still can't get your blood drawn once a month. I don't need you to donate blood to me! Where's the doctor who agreed to let you get your blood drawn once a month? I'll go look for them!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was about to question the nurse in charge of the blood bags, Martin Weiss tugged her arm. "Don't go!"</p></div>
