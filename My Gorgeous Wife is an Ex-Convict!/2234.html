        <h1>Chapter 2232</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina hugged Hadwin Stephenson back as she gently patted his back and comforted him softly. "Alright, there, there. I&rsquo;ll always be here for you. You know me. I always keep my promises!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How long are you two planning on hugging?" A teasing voice rang in Lina's ears, and she finally seemed to realize it. She stopped hugging him and turned to look at Grace, who had walked over. Then, she realized many people around them were looking at them. She instantly blushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace noticed her best friend's slightly reddened eyes and froze, but she smiled and held her best friend's hand. "Come, let me show you what I got for Tina's full moon party." With that said, she pulled her best friend toward the lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason did not follow them but went up to Hadwin Stephenson. "Everyone here will probably discuss how you two have a great relationship right now. It can end some rumors without much effort."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson did not explain the hug earlier. He did not do it for the rumors. He just could not help himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was scared when Lina said she wanted more children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What would you do if Grace got pregnant again?" Hadwin Stephenson asked suddenly. As far as he knew, Grace almost died when she gave birth to the triplets. If she got pregnant again, it would cause great damage to her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's not going to get pregnant again. I'm not going to let her get pregnant again," Jason said confidently. Then, he raised his eyebrows and looked at Hadwin Stephenson. "What's the matter? Are you afraid of Lina getting pregnant again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I am," said Hadwin Stephenson after smiling bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he would go mad if he had to go through that again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are many things a man can do to prevent a woman from getting pregnant. It depends on how much you're willing to sacrifice for them," said Jason. He had also gone through what Hadwin Stephenson was going through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Something flashed across Hadwin Stephenson's eyes when he heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the lounge, Grace asked Lina what had happened and why her eyes were red. Lina said, "Hadwin was scared when I said I wanted more children. He said he didn't want any more kids. I... never knew he was that scared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina sobbed a little when she said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had witnessed for herself how Hadwin Stephenson went through the days when her best friend was in a coma, so she could understand Hadwin Stephenson's fear. "Men might look strong sometimes. It's as if they can handle the sky if it falls and take care of anything. But sometimes, they can be very fragile too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the same for both Hadwin Stephenson and Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just think that I didn't care enough about him, especially after I woke up. I focused most of my attention on my daughter. Otherwise, it wouldn&rsquo;t have taken me this long to find out how scared he was,&rdquo; said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And what about you? Are you planning on having another baby?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina hesitated for a moment, but she eventually shook her head. "I don't want him to be that scared anymore. If I do get pregnant, perhaps he&rsquo;ll be in fear from the moment I find out I'm pregnant until I give birth to the baby." If that was the case, her pregnancy would be almost a year of mental torture for him.</p></div>
