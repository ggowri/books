        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was startled, and the next moment, she met his deep eyes that were as calm as an ancient well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... are you awake?" She was stunned. "Did I wake you up?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have a light sleep." He said that he had already woken up when she entered the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did you come?" She asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the evening." He replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Evening? She was surprised. That meant he had been here for several hours already. "Did you have dinner when you arrived?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not yet." He said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let me quickly make you something to eat. What do you want to eat?" She hurriedly asked, after all, it was already 10 o'clock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Anything is fine." He said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't help but think that he was still the same as before, always indifferent to food. It seemed like no matter what kind of food was given to him, whether it was simple or exquisite, he would eat it all the same. It was even difficult to know what he liked to eat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let me prepare something for you." She said, her gaze falling on the hand that he was still holding onto.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't seem to want to let go of her hand, so she had to remind him, "Could you please loosen your grip a bit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He finally let go of her hand, and she walked over to the fridge, took out a bag of frozen food, and started cooking in the kitchen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, frozen food was the quickest option at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason sat on the sofa, watching the busy figure in the kitchen, then lowered his head and looked at his right hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That empty feeling swept over him again, and every time he touched her, that feeling became even stronger. It was like something was slipping away from his hand, and the harder he tried to hold on, the more he lost it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was this feeling caused by her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would this feeling disappear after they "tried"?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Veronica had been busy in the kitchen for more than ten minutes, a bowl of frozen dumplings was finally ready.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She carried the dumplings to the table and placed the bowl and spoon in front of him. "Um...the dumplings are faster to cook."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh." He responded lightly, lowered his head, and started eating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat beside him, watching him eat the dumplings with his head down, feeling that this moment of peace and tranquility was so beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene was like a dream to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of his lowered head, a few strands of his hair playfully fell over his forehead, partially blocking his vision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand gently lifted and flicked one of the strands away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body suddenly stiffened, his hand stopped moving, and his head lifted slightly, turning towards her. His dark eyes stared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica suddenly realized what she had done and felt a bit flustered. "Um... your bangs were blocking your vision, so I'm sorry I did that without asking!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she tried to retract her hand, but he held onto her wrist again. "Why apologize?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" She blinked, confused. "I... I did something without your permission, so I should apologize."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her hand was still in the same position as before, and she felt even more embarrassed now. Her voice stuttered as she spoke.</span></p></div>
