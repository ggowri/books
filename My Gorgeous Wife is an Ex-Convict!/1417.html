        <h1>Chapter 1416</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn tried to pull the hem of her hospital gown back from Martin Weiss's hand as she spoke. However, how could Martin Weiss let go?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was afraid he would not know when he would see her again if he let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn frowned, and one of the two men guarding the ward said, "Mr. Weiss, please let go, or you'll only embarrass everyone." With that, the man grabbed Martin Weiss's hand which held the hem of Kyla Corbyn&rsquo;s hospital gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Martin Weiss seemed not to have heard that and just looked straight at Kyla Corbyn. "I know you hate me. Yes, I deserve it, but I beg you, let me talk to you alone, okay? There are so many things I want to tell you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But I have nothing to say to you," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Nothing to say?' Martin Weiss smiled wryly. He was still tugging at the hem of her hospital gown even though the bodyguards were trying to pry his hand away. A burst of pain came from his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His whole hand felt like it was going to break. His fingers were already contorted, but he kept on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He just did not want to let go. He was afraid he would not be able to grab her anymore once he did! He would even lose this little connection with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at him coldly and said suddenly, "Martin Weiss, you're still as selfish as ever. You're always forcing others to do what you want. If you want others to grovel and admit their mistakes, then they have to grovel and admit their mistakes. If you want people to listen to you, then they must stay and listen to you. People like you never know what respect is!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss instantly stiffened, and his lips trembled. He looked like he was defeated. He gave off a sense of dejection, and little by little, his fingers loosened on the hem he had been gripping tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn pulled back the hem of her hospital gown and turned around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He suddenly shouted, "I know Paisley Daniels framed you for her abortion! Also, you were the one who donated me the bone marrow! You were the one who saved me, weren&rsquo;t you? Kyla, I'll make it up to you. I'll do whatever you want!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She stopped in her tracks, turned her head slowly, and looked at the man in front of her. She suddenly found it ridiculous and pathetic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This man had viciously made her kneel and grovel a few days before, but now he was saying that he wanted to make it up to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin Weiss, not everything in this world can be compensated," she whispered. As she looked at the person in front of her, she seemed to be getting lost in past memories. "I did donate my bone marrow to save a young man. I had hoped that the person I would save was honest and kind. If we were lucky, perhaps we could smile at each other when we met in the vast crowd."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss looked at her intently. It felt like his heart was weightless as it kept falling. In his ears, her voice kept hitting his eardrums word by word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But I don't want the person I saved to use the life I gave him to hurt me again and again. So Martin Weiss, I don&rsquo;t want you to be the person I saved!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that, Kyla Corbyn turned and walked into the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As the door closed, it was as if it had set two worlds apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss stared at the door and stood still like a sculpture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After an unknown amount of time, he suddenly bent over while gasping for breath. His face had turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Can't I make things up to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She even hopes she never saved me? Because... if it&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;d be too cruel to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why did I find out the truth after hurting her again and again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why did he give her such a cruel truth?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He recalled how she had reverently asked for a sign through lottery poetry in the temple back when they were dating. She was overjoyed when she got a great sign.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Back then, he had asked her curiously, "What did you wish for? Why are you so happy after getting a good sign?"</p></div>
