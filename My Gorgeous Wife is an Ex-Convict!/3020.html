        <h1>Chapter 3018</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There are many social events, and they are even more unavoidable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now that he said such words, it meant that he intended to bear the burden of these social events in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, you're so good to me," Valda couldn't help but say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" he said, but he actually felt that he hadn't done enough, otherwise how could he still make her sad and upset from time to time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's really good, Brian. I'm glad to have met you, fallen in love with you, and be liked by you," she murmured. Maybe it was because she had drunk a little at the banquet, so she was a bit drunk now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, she gently closed her eyes and leaned her head on his shoulder. "Although I feel sad and upset when I'm with you, the happiness is actually far greater than these sad and upset feelings. So, it's good to be with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice tapped on his eardrums, and shook his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, from now on, I will be very good to you, I will use all my strength... to protect you, to prevent you from being sad and unhappy, I want you... to be happy with me in the future..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In the future, shall I draw a comic book about our daily life? Let's call it 'Mr. Hart and Miss Valda's Daily Life'. I want to draw every bit of our ordinary life into the comic book... so that in the future, when we have children, we can pass the comic book down to them, and let them envy me... for finding such a good man..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, her voice became more and more unclear, and suddenly, she began to take off her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's hot..." she muttered, quickly taking off her coat, and then turning around to start taking off his clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, don't move," he stopped her actions, "you're drunk, I'll take you to bed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." She immediately stopped moving, like an obedient child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He carried her horizontally and brought her to the bed in the bedroom. Just as he was about to get up, her hand suddenly grabbed his hand and pulled it hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Caught off guard, he fell onto the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took advantage of the situation and pressed him down, and their lips met in a kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her kiss was so intoxicating that he was immediately lost in it, until her hands began tugging at his clothes and he suddenly snapped out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't, Valda..." Brian quickly stopped her. "You're drunk. Lie down first, I'll have someone make you a bowl of sobering soup and you can drink it later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I don't want to drink... What sobering soup? I just want you..." Valda slurred her words, but her hands kept moving and wouldn't stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian felt like this was a huge test of his self-control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the two have been intimate in recent days, it was only when she was sober. He didn't want to take advantage of her when she was drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When you're sober, you can ask me for anything you want, but for now, just lie down and don't move," he said, trying to get her off of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But she instead clung tightly to him, as if afraid of being pulled away.</p></div>
