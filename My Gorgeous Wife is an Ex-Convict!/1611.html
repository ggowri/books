        <h1>Chapter 1609</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Lynch, I&rsquo;ve looked into Grace&rsquo;s time in L City during the past five years. I have information on what you want to hear, but you need to pay extra,&rdquo; a man said to Irene Lynch on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What? Pay extra?" Irene Lynch's good mood only lasted a few seconds before it turned sour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"When you asked me to help you investigate, you didn't say she was the mistress of the Reed family as well as Jason's wife! I'm taking a huge risk by giving you this information! That small fee you paid before isn&rsquo;t enough," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Small... fee? It was 300,000 dollars!' Irene Lynch hated it but asked, "How much do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Five million," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch almost crushed her teeth from gritting them too hard. 'Five million? That's blackmail!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you think the information you&rsquo;re giving me will be worth five million dollars?" snapped Irene Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They said, "It&rsquo;s worth the money. Miss Lynch, isn&rsquo;t the thing you want most getting rid of Grace and becoming the mistress of the Reed family? The information I have is enough for you to succeed! Miss Lynch, you should know what's more important. The mistress of the Reed family, or five million dollars?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch pursed her red lips. She had five million dollars, of course. In the past two years, her status had risen since her daughter became the adopted daughter of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Reed family only gave her a residence and 200,000 dollars a month. However, she made use of her connections with the Reed family to create a livestream channel. She would find socialites to help her sell goods and started a resale business through those people. One could say that she had made a lot of money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the Reed family used to turn a blind eye and did not pay much attention to these things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... Jason had announced Grace's identity to the upper class. The socialites naturally shunned her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Terrence warned her in the boutique, some of the business deals she had gotten through her connections with the Reed family fell through and she was forced to terminate her contract with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Reed family had not told her anything, but Irene Lynch knew that the Reed family must have done something for these business deals to fall through. They did not want her to continue using her connections with the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If this was the case, her way of earning money was hindered. The money she had would probably dwindle as time passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She must turn the tables around with one move. Otherwise, 200,000 dollars a month would not be enough for her to spend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch was not thinking about how she used to live her life back then. She was only thinking about arming herself with luxury items and making those who previously looked down on her kneel before her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, I'll give you five million dollars. I hope the information you're giving me is worth the money!" said Irene Lynch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It is!" they replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch could not help trembling a little after seeing the information they sent over. A hint of surprise flashed across her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was better than she had expected! If she made good use of this information, then Grace... would be ruined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang was put into the detention center. The Reed family would sue him for the matters regarding the child.</p></div>
