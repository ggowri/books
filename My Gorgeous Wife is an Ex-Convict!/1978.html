        <h1>Chapter 1976</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the mourning hall of Reed Residence, Jason looked at his father's memorial tablet in front of him with a touch of bitterness at the corner of his lips. "Dad, I'm sorry. I thought I would never forgive that woman and have her die to atone for her sins, but I love Grace so much that I don't want her to suffer. So forgive me, Dad!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Holding the lit incense sticks, he respectfully bowed three times to his father's memorial tablet before inserting them in the burner and turning around to leave the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he got back to the main house, Uncle Kwan said, "Young master Reed, Young Madam brought Young Master Mo, Second Young Master, and Young Lady out on a trip."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, I got it," Jason said without further questioning. They had agreed at the beginning to never let him know if she was taking the children to see that woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That was exactly what she did. She just told him they were going on a trip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Maybe this is for the best,' Jason thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Outside a kindergarten, it was the children's outdoor playtime. Many were gathered around to play games, but William was the only one looking at a piano score as he sat on a small stool outside. He seemed a little out of place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked at the piano score carefully. aunt Cummins said she was taking Jasper and the rest to L City, so he would be attending kindergarten alone in the next few days. Although no one in the kindergarten knew that his mother was a convict and discriminated against him, he did not want to play with the others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He just wanted to be with Jasper, and he knew that Jasper loved his piano skills. She always liked to play with him, and they would practice difficult piano scores together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He never found it difficult to play the piano before. The teachers who gave him piano lessons had always said he was a genius.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, playing the piano with Jasper made him feel scared. Jasper could read music scores as well as he could. She could even understand music and interpret it better than him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">During the time he had spent with Jasper, he could feel that Jasper was improving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If he fell behind on his piano skills one day, would he lose his value as a toy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William did not notice that someone was secretly taking photos of him with a camera in a corner not far away...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace came to L City with her three children to visit her mentor and his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts had already prepared guest rooms for them to stay in during their stay in L City so that his wife and her three grandchildren could spend more time together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts had recovered now. Her eyes were full of gratefulness when she saw Grace. "Grace, thank you. Thank you for doing this for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mrs. Watts, I can bring the three kids to see you and Mentor whenever you miss them, but Jay won't..."</p></div>
