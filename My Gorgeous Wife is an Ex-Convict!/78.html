        <h1>Chapter 77</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why should I apologize?" Zoe said angrily. She rubbed her face and stepped near her brother as if intending to shove him down the escalator next.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, people came over one after another. One of them recognized Lily. After all, she was a popular star. Although she was wearing sunglasses and a hat that covered most of her face, she was still spotted. A crowd began to form.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's Lily. Is that her fianc&eacute; next to her?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What are they doing here?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's wrong with the escalator? Did something happen just now?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Voices sounded around them. Lina helped Grace walk down the escalator. Seeing this, Sean hurriedly caught up with them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily's eyes flashed with surprise. She hadn't expected Sean to leave her behind and run after Grace! And the people around her began to spread gossip.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Lily's fianc&eacute; went to chase after another woman."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh my god, is this a bloody love triangle?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily's face flushed with embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She watched Sean reach Grace and Lina at the bottom of the escalator and she weighed whether to follow. Grace Cummins had killed her sister. No, she would not be checking to ensure that Grace was okay.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Lily,&rdquo; Zoe whispered. &ldquo;We should go.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Dozens of people had their phones out and were closing in on them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily managed a coy smile as she and Zoe held onto each other and hurried away. She covered her face with her hands and tried her best to avoid the cameras on the phones as they cut through the crowd.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean caught up to Grace. &ldquo;H-how much were your medical expenses? I&rsquo;ll cover it. Zoe didn&rsquo;t mean it. Let&rsquo;s just keep this between ourselves. We can talk&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Talk about what?" Lina asked indignantly. "Sean, how dare you say that your sister didn't do it on purpose? You Stevens Family people are truly one of a kind."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she spoke, she opened the door, let her friend sit in the front passenger seat, and then sat in the driver's seat herself. Sean had still been knocking on the door, and his face was pale. When he spoke, his voice was trembling.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this time, even Lina could feel that Sean was scared. However, what was he afraid of? Was he afraid that Grace would sue Zoe?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if they were to take the case to court, Zoe would only have to pay some compensation. The Stevens Family wouldn't care about much money.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Lina drove away with Grace, Sean stood rooted to the spot with only the words "I'm done for" repeating over and over in his mind.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">No matter what the relationship between Jason and Grace was, at least for the moment, Jason seemed to have a special connection to Grace. Since Grace had been injured, and it was because of Zoe, then the Stevens Family was responsible &hellip;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And Jason Reed had the power, wealth and connections to bury them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Damn it!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe couldn&rsquo;t refrain from being a bitch for a few minutes?! Was it really that hard to take the high road? Sean calculated scenarios. How far would Jason Reed go? Would he really extend himself in such a way? Sean didn&rsquo;t know.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And he didn&rsquo;t want to find out&hellip;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina drove Grace to the hospital, registered at the front desk, and then waited in line.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although Grace didn't say anything, Lina could tell from her expression that she was in great pain.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, she didn't know when her good friend had stopped crying out in pain in front of others.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was it because of those days in prison? Had she already suffered so much that she would no longer cry out in pain?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking of the strange accident, Lina felt that things were not so simple, but she had no evidence to support her postulation.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing her good friend take out her phone, Lina asked, "Who are you calling?"</p></div>
