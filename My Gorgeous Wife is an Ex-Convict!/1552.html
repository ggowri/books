        <h1>Chapter 1550</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss probably knew he had to pay such a price, but he still reversed the case for Kyla anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Martin Weiss's really atoning for his sins. Has he come to see you these years?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, but he knows I don't want to see him so he won't show up in front of me most of the time," said Kyla. Then, she said in the direction of her son who was playing with Jasper," The Weiss family has come for Nelson many times, hoping that Nelson will acknowledge his paternal family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Did you reject them?" asked Grace. After all, Nelson still had the surname Corbyn and not Ye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla said, "It was Nelson who didn't want to do it. Martin Weiss previously said some things to Nelson that he shouldn't have said. He thought the kid wouldn't care and he could coax Nelson afterward, but... once some damage is done, even a child won't forget it easily."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Will you forgive Martin Weiss?" asked Grace. She had specifically sought out Martin Weiss's news and knew that in these five years, Martin Weiss had not married. He never had any girlfriends or got into scandals. She speculated that Martin Weiss was probably waiting for Kyla to change her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I made peace with him five years ago. I've already forgiven him because it takes emotions to hate someone. But nothing more is ever going to happen between us," Kyla said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if those unforgettable feelings were now as transient as fleeting clouds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had no idea if it was a good thing or a pity that Kyla had moved on from Martin Weiss. Someone she used to love so much had now become someone she would never be with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace left with her daughter, she saw a black Maybach parked quietly in the shadows near the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could faintly see someone in the backseat through the car window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It's rare to see such a car in a place like this... Is it Martin Weiss?' The thought appeared in Grace&rsquo;s mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though Martin Weiss ruined Paisley Daniels's reputation, made her get the punishment she deserved, and helped Kyla reverse the case, the pain Kyla and Nelson suffered could never disappear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, her daughter's cute childlike voice rang out. "Mommy, it's time to get off!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace suddenly snapped back to reality and realized that the subway they were on had arrived at the stop they were supposed to get off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had been preoccupied thinking about Kyla and Martin Weiss's affairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, let's go home." She took her daughter by the hand and headed for the subway exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Home... For her and Jasper, Reed Residence was home!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She took her daughter back to Reed Residence on foot, which was also a way for her daughter to be more familiar with the routes around the area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Grace did not expect to see a tall figure standing not far ahead as she approached Reed Residence's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Wearing a beige casual outfit, the delicate but indifferent face was full of anxiety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'That's... Brian!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If Jason was the man she loved most, then Brian was the man she had no idea how to face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was her childhood friend who had gone through thick and thin with her. Brian had also helped her and saved her after they grew up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew about Brian's feelings for her but could not reciprocate. All she could do was reject him.</p></div>
