        <h1>Chapter 3620</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Roger is not Lawrence! The DNA has already confirmed it, there's nothing to doubt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So why did he come to her today to say these things? Jasper didn't understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shaking her head, she brushed away the doubts in her mind and picked up her phone again, dialing her father's number...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Roger arrived at the school's music room and rented one of the rooms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he sat in front of the piano, he pressed the keys forcefully, producing a thunderous sound.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But instead of continuing to play, he stared intently at the distinct black and white keys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper...she could trust William like this. He only said a few words and she felt like he was disparaging William!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what about back then? She always claimed they were friends, but when the Abbott family had trouble, when his parents were scolded by Grace, when she heard his mother telling him to please her, she didn't even want to hear his explanation. She just assumed he was guilty, assumed he had ulterior motives for getting close to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why didn't she trust him even a little back then?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A wave of pain emanated from his heart, causing Roger's fingers, which were originally placed on the piano keys, to continuously tighten until they became tightly clenched fists.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Roger, when you say things like this, does it mean you have never sincerely treated anyone?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice kept echoing in her ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she know how ridiculous he felt when he heard those words?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had treated her so sincerely back then, regarding her as a benefactor, as redemption, as everything!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, she was like his faith. At that time, he even felt that he could give everything for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would strive to learn any piece of music she liked, even if it meant playing until his </span><span>fingers turned red and painfully swollen. As long as she smiled and said, "It sounds good," it would be the greatest happiness for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she made him fall from the pinnacle of happiness straight into hell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She easily let go of his hand, even ignoring him when he begged for help!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only she had believed in him a little at that time, if only the Reed family hadn't treated their family like garbage... then maybe his parents would still be alive...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, so it seems that your choices can vary when it comes to different people. And for me, I'm just a toy that has become useless once you lost interest, is that right?" His voice floated softly in the music room, but there was no one to answer...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...Although Jasper had already asked his father to help suppress any news related to William, and the Barlow family was doing the same.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While mainstream media didn't cover the story, there were still several reports circulating online.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even directly accused William of being a gold digger and tied the label of "loving the rich and despising the poor" to him. There was a viewpoint online that William is now the young master of the Barlow family, while Harold and Camelia are in decline, so William has no intention of acknowledging them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some even said that William truly has Lily's blood running through his veins! After all, wasn't it Lily who caused the death of her own sister for the sake of wealth?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, William is someone who is willing to return to the Barlow family for the sake of wealth, but refuses to acknowledge his own biological grandparents!</span></p></div>
