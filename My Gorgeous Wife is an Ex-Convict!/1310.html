        <h1>Chapter 1309</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? Grace married Jason?" In the Stevens family's living room, Zoe's face was full of disbelief!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could it be? Many socialites want to marry Jason but they don&rsquo;t even have the chance. How could a woman like Grace have the right to do so?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brother, could you be mistaken?" asked Zoe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could I be mistaken? Jason called himself Grace's husband in front of her! And Jason's subordinate called Grace &lsquo;Young Madam&rsquo;," said Sean, still shuddering at the thought of the scene in the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately... he was pinned down by her bodyguard before it was too late. If his hand had touched Grace, it would probably be a question of... whether he still had his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Sean could not help but feel a pang of fear in his heart when he remembered that he had watched as Lily got someone to pull out Grace's fingernails and cripple her hands in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that Jason and Grace were married, Jason would probably punish the Stevens family and the Atkinson family as a warning to others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoe looked begrudging. "Grace has such dumb luck, and Jason is blind! Women like Grace are only fit to sweep the streets."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't say things like that outside. Do you think having one crippled leg isn't enough?" snapped Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hatred flashed across Zoe's eyes. If it had not been for Grace, would she have a crippled leg now? She had thought of looking for a chance to punish Grace and cripple her leg since Jason had dumped her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her plans are long gone now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So the Atkinson family..." said Mr. Stevens.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean said, "The Atkinson family is now in trouble too. The Atkinson family did a lot to Grace back then. If Jason really wants to get justice for Grace, the Atkinson family will probably be worse off than the Stevens family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could it be?" Mrs. Stevens was perplexed. If Jason was going to stand up for Grace, then the Atkinson family meant the same to the Stevens family as Grace meant to them back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were pawns they were trying to get rid of! Being involved with them would only cause more trouble to the Stevens family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It had been easy to get rid of Grace, but the Stevens family dared not get rid of the Atkinson family! If they did, the Stevens family could forget about staying in high society!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Stevens family was now in a complete dilemma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't we just beg Grace to write things off?" Mrs. Stevens asked with a hint of hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean chuckled bitterly. "Beg? Did we write it off when Grace begged us?" Having reached this stage, Sean did not think he would get anywhere by begging Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Stevens family's living room fell into silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, the Atkinson family had also fallen silent. After a long while, Harold Atkinson looked at his daughter and asked, "Are Jason and Grace really married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," said Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that Jason may punish the Atkinson family as a warning to others," Harold Atkinson said sternly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Darling, what should we do? We can't just sit back and wait," said Camelia Meyer who was nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold Atkinson looked coldly at his second daughter. "Since it was you who caused all this trouble, solve it yourself. Don't bring the family into this mess. The Atkinson family has borne enough for you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Dad!" Lily glared at her father. "Dad, do you think I can solve this alone? Didn't you help me with everything Grace suffered in prison? Jason will retaliate against the entire Atkinson family if he wants to avenge Grace!"</p></div>
