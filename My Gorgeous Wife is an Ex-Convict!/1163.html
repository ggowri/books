        <h1>Chapter 1162</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss now announced that she did not even have the chance to gamble!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, must you take Nelson away from me?" Kyla Corbyn looked up and stared intently at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked somewhat flustered at her gaze!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why am I flustered? It's only natural for me to take back my son's custody!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Kyla Corbyn. I won't let Nelson stay with you. He'll only suffer if he&rsquo;s with you. What can you give him? Do you think setting up a food stall and feeding him is enough?" Martin Weiss snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla Corbyn nodded unnaturally. "Okay, I see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unusually calm, she took a step back and looked down at her hands that were still in his grip. "Mr. Weiss, can you let go? I'm not going to try and poke myself blind again. After all, it wouldn't do me any good if I were blind, would it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face darkened, and he loosened his grip. Only then did he find that his palms and back were covered with cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman had forced him into a cold sweat again, just like the time she stabbed herself in the stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn retreated one step, two steps... until they were several steps away from each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, sorry for bothering you today," she murmured the words softly and turned toward the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thin figure looked as if she would fall once the wind blew. Martin Weiss's eyes could not help darkening. 'When did she become so thin?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even... when he held her wrist earlier, it was evident that she was thinner than when he had last held her hand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was almost like holding a bone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so calm as if nothing had happened! It was as if she was running away after messing with his mind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could she be so calm when he was so uncomfortable? There was even a stabbing pain in his chest!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Kyla Corbyn's hand was about to open the door, there was the sound of footsteps behind her. The next moment, she was grabbed by the wrist again by Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could react, his lips were pressed hard against hers. He was kissing her on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to break her calm expression, freak her out, scare her, and prove that he was not the passive one!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She struggled fiercely to resist him, but he pushed her against the wall, subduing all her struggles. He continued to kiss her domineeringly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kissing her seemed to feel the same. The only difference was that she used to accept his kiss sweetly, and now, she was resisting his kiss so strongly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... even though she was resisting him strongly, he could not help himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss ended, Martin Weiss felt like he had fallen into a trance. He should hate and disdain this woman, but his body seemed to long for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't go..." The words escaped his mouth almost involuntarily, and he regretted it as soon as he said them! 'What am I talking about? Am I trying to make this woman stay?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn shivered and looked at Martin Weiss. Suddenly, she said, "If I don't leave tonight, can you give up Nelson's custody?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words pierced his heart like a sharp sword.</p></div>
