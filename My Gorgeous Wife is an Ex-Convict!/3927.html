        <h1>Chapter 3925</h1>
        <div>.<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... even if he really was annoyed by her crying, there are many ways to stop it. Why resort to this method?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, she had heard rumors about this Reed family young master before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They say that he is difficult to approach and has never been in a relationship with any woman, nor has he had any ambiguous relationships with anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some even suspect that he might be gay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So what just happened...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems like you've regained your senses now." Mick's voice interrupted her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy blinked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, can you tell me why you came to my room?" Mick asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was only then that she realized that she was in his room and that she had come here herself. She only remembered having a nightmare about her mother's fall and death... and then everything went blank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... had a nightmare, so my emotions got out of control... and I came to your room without thinking. I'm sorry." Nancy apologized, looking embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She instinctively wanted to lower her head, but his fingers were still holding her chin, making it impossible for her to even make that movement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A nightmare?" He raised an eyebrow slightly, which could explain why she had tears all over her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you dream about my mother?" His fingers lightly brushed away the tears on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mm-hmm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The deceased have passed away, and you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What does 'the departed have passed' mean? Is it like my mother, who once she's gone, no one in this world will remember her except for me?" Nancy suddenly became emotional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's words were like a thorn, pricking her nerves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your mother was the wife of the Schultz family. Besides you, there will naturally be others who remember her, and the Schultz family will also remember her," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy laughed, but tears were rolling in her eyes. "The Schultz family...she's no longer the wife of the Schultz family. After my mother fell into a coma and was hospitalized, the Schultz family kicked her out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He frowned, not liking her shattered laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if she was a fragile vase that could shatter at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mick...as the high and mighty young master of the Reed family, do you think that the lives of poor people are really that worthless? Even if they try their best to please the rich, once something happens, the poor will be easily kicked away by the rich?" Nancy asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Rely on oneself rather than others," Mick said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy let out a hoarse laugh. "As expected of a young master. Only those who have never experienced the hardships of life and have a smooth sailing life can say such things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this moment, her courage seemed to have grown, daring to say things she wouldn't normally say in front of him. "But young master, do you know? In this world, many poor people can't just rely on themselves. Even if they are already working hard to survive, the rich can easily negate everything with a wave of their hand!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Mick was aware of this kind of thing, after all, there are many injustices in this world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Nancy was the first person to say it to his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you have a conflict with the Schultz family?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think I have the qualifications to have a conflict with them?" Nancy self-mockingly said, "Someone like me, the Schultz family can easily crush me with a single blow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Schultz family can't crush you," Mick said, "If you're afraid of what the Schultz family might do to you, I can talk to them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was taken aback, and that strange feeling in her chest resurfaced once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick towards her...</p></div>
