        <h1>Chapter 2415</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mick Reed listened with a hazy notion. "So, what about your affection for Daddy, Mommy?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Jason beside her, and her red lips gently said, "I'll always like him. I'll like him very much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those bright almond-shaped eyes made Jason feel touched. If his son were not with them, he would have hugged the woman in front of him and kissed her hard to tell her his joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the third wheel in a daze, Jason said, "You'll meet someone you'll always like someday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I think I've already met that person. I&rsquo;ll always like Mommy," said Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was instantly speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately said, "It&rsquo;s a different affection from the affection you have for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mick Reed suddenly showed a look as if it was troublesome. 'Are there so many types of affections? Maybe I should talk about this later.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After returning to the hotel, Grace put her son to bed after he washed up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Technically speaking, she did not even have to coax him. He climbed into bed, lay down in the perfect sleeping position... and fell asleep right away! He never needed her to worry about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was unlike her troublesome daughter. She needed to chat with someone before going to bed. When William was around, her daughter would chat with William. Now that William no longer stayed with the Reed family, she had to find someone else to chat with. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you been coaxing Jasper to sleep during my absence?" Grace asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else can I do? I can't ask Mick to coax Jasper to sleep, can I?" Asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did she ask you to tell her a story?" She speculated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, she asked me to sing her nursery rhymes." Jason felt a throbbing headache at the thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nursery rhymes... He had not sung those for years, yet now he had to sing what he thought were childish nursery rhymes for his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew only a few nursery rhymes, so Terrence had to look for nursery rhymes for him to learn. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze at that. It seemed that he had improved his ways of coaxing their daughter to sleep. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you sing, then?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he said in resignation. Their daughter looked so much like Grace. As long as that little face looked at him and sweetly called him &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo;, he would give her everything she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Speaking of which, I've never heard you sing nursery rhymes before. Why don't you sing one for me?" Grace said excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was speechless. There was a touch of embarrassment on his handsome face. "What's so good about them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Please sing. I want to hear you sing," her gentle voice said coquettishly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason instantly gave in. Her coquettish behavior was more fatal than their daughter's pampered acts!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He always seemed to give in when he was in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay... I'll sing if you want to hear it," he murmured as he parted his thin lips and started singing lively nursery rhymes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace held her cheek with one hand and listened to Jason sing nursery rhymes. His cold voice was unspeakably beautiful as it sang these nursery rhymes. </p></div>
