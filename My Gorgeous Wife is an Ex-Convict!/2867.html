        <h1>Chapter 2865</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would Grace be pregnant if it weren&rsquo;t for you? Didn't you say you value her more than your own life? Is putting her through all this pain how you value her?" snapped Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face darkened. "Brian, what's the matter? Haven't you given up on Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly sneered. "Give up? Jason, if you hadn't interfered, how could I have mistaken someone else for Grace and recognized her so late? If I had recognized her sooner and if she had fallen for me, I would never have let her suffer what she suffered today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller never expected that the first thing she heard was Brian's speech when she arrived at the hospital and passed the place guarded by the Reed family's bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe everything was meant to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She heard those words because the Reed family's bodyguards recognized her and let her in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, Brian loved Grace. He loved her before and still did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Losing Grace was the biggest regret of his life. Who was she for him to transfer such deep feelings to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She laughed at what she had said about trying hard to make him love her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, what are you doing here?" The first person to notice Valda Theller was Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla said that, the two men still in dispute froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's expression instantly changed, and he stiffened. He turned slowly and looked at Valda Theller not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She no longer looked as distraught as she was at the comic fiesta venue. She had probably cleaned up as she had even changed her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her expression was calm. She looked at him quietly but not with the usual smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian only felt guilty when he met Valda Theller's gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He saw her being mobbed at the comic fiesta. He wanted to help her but suddenly received a call from his staff. He was told on the phone that Grace was urgently rushed to the hospital, and her situation looked critical.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His mind went blank at that moment. When he realized it, he turned and ran out of the place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing here? I... I asked my staff to help you at the venue. Did you meet them?" Brian asked. Even he did not notice his voice was unnatural as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was on the phone with Kyla earlier and knew Grace was sent to the hospital, so I came to take a look," said Valda Theller as she looked past Brian and saw the baby Jason was holding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She walked up to Jason. "Is this Grace's baby? It's great that the baby was born safely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But she still has to go to the NICU for observation," Jason said as he handed the baby to a nurse next to him. The nurse took the baby and left, followed by Jason's bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At 37 weeks, the baby's organs were fully developed, but it was important to keep an eye on her for a few days to be safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about Grace? Is she okay?" Valda Theller asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not sure. We'll see how Grace recovers after giving birth," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller nodded. "I'll wait for Grace to come out first. I'll leave after checking on her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stood at the side, looking at Valda Theller. He wanted to speak but hesitated.</p></div>
