        <h1>Chapter 2664</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... That's not what I meant... Oh, no. That's exactly what I meant. No, what I meant is that you would&rsquo;ve gotten the short end of the stick even if anything happened. But you wouldn&rsquo;t do anything to me..." she stammered as she explained, her face blushing even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haha!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not help bursting out into a chuckle. The woman's red cheeks, round eyes, and hands that were flopping around somehow reminded him of a squirrel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was adorable and funny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was stunned as she looked at the smile on Brian's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If his smiles earlier had only been faint ones, this smile was more jubilant than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" he asked when he saw her looking at him blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You look good when you smile," she said as she could not help raising her hand and stretching it toward his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His smile gave her the urge to draw it. She wanted to record the way he smiled with her eyes. It was just like the snow slowly melting in early spring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at the fingers coming closer and closer to his cheek. She would have missed as long as he turned his face slightly to the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Other than Grace, he disliked other women's touch, but Valda Theller... was gradually becoming an exception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe because they were in a relationship, touching seemed to become natural for them. If he resisted her touch, he might expose himself in front of Grace in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, maybe it was better for them to get familiar with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not avoid Valda Theller's hand. Her warm fingers pressed against his cheek and put him in a trance. It felt like Grace was caressing his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With his eyelashes quivering slightly, Brian gently looked down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had touched his face in the same way and told him she was not the one he was looking for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace must have made her choice at the time. She chose Jason, while he was just someone who was abandoned in the course of time and could not get out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never regretted falling in love with Grace, and he had no intention of falling in love with anyone else in his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if Grace hoped he could get over her and fall for someone else, then... he would do it. He would do anything to make her happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a cry of surprise. Then, the warmth disappeared from his cheeks. Brian looked up at the blushing face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter even if you meant it. We're a couple. It's natural for us to touch each other," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Huh? Natural?' Her heart seemed to suddenly skip a beat when he said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A couple... We're only a fake couple, but he said that so naturally.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Also, don't think I'm not gonna do anything to you. Don't think too highly of me, and don't think too lightly of yourself. Even if I tell you that I won&rsquo;t do anything to you, don't let your guard down," he said.</p></div>
