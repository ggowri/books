        <h1>Chapter 1630</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Do you think going into a hotel means doing something dirty? Sure enough, people with dirty minds always think dirty things about other people," Lina snapped back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Holly Greer's expression changed. "Lina, are you scolding me? How dare you scold others when you did such a shameful thing yourself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do I have to be timid when people want to hurl dirt at me?" Lina asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If nothing's going on between you and Hadwin Stephenson, why did you get a hotel room? Why did you stay in the room for so long? You even changed your clothes before leaving! You became a homewrecker but won't admit it!" said Holly Greer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Due to the disturbance she caused, many colleagues had gathered around. Although they said nothing, some of their eyes were full of disapproval of Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Because my clothes were dirty. Even the blind could see I was covered in filth in the photo of me walking into the hotel. Is there a problem with me going in to get changed? Besides, Hadwin Stephenson was in the hotel lobby the whole time. He didn't go upstairs. Or you can go to the hotel and check the surveillance," said Lina, looking confident. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're lying!" Holly Greer immediately denied it and said, "He got into the elevator with you and went to your room. He didn't stay in the lobby at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina sneered as she looked at Holly Greer. "You know it as well as though you saw it with your own eyes. Were you the one who took these photos and then deliberately posted them on the forum?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Holly Greer's expression instantly changed as soon as they said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I just... think that's what happened," stammered Holly Greer as she glared at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oh, you think? I also think you took those photos of me and posted them on the forum. Maybe you owe me an apology too," said Lina. The colleagues around them also looked at Holly Greer suspiciously, speculating something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Holly Greer said indignantly, "Anyway, it wasn&rsquo;t me. Lina, you lie with a straight face and are a homewrecker. What right do you have? Just wait and see!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina shrugged, not wanting to bother with petty people like Holly Greer. Judging by her reaction, she was probably the one who took the photos and posted them on the forum.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Lina did not expect the matter to go viral online by noon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Someone in the office leaked the news to a verified account online that later shared it online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, netizens found out all about Lina's personal information and called her a homewrecker. Someone even got their hands on the hotel&rsquo;s surveillance footage that showed her and Hadwin Stephenson entering the same hotel room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, Holly Greer looked at Lina triumphantly and spoke like a victor, "Look, I didn&rsquo;t even have to expose you. The netizens already uncovered your lies!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked at the overwhelming criticisms online with a cold face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Those keyboard warriors called her a heinous homewrecker who got between another couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not mind the criticisms. After all, after a life and death experience, none of this mattered to her. She was just worried that her parents would be affected by the negative news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she left work in the evening, a large group of reporters surrounded her as soon as she walked out of the design office. They surrounded her and constantly asked all kinds of tough questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Sweeney, are you a homewrecker?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you know that Hadwin Stephenson and Katherine Jackson are getting married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What exactly did you do with Mr. Hadwin Stephenson in the hotel room that day?" Even if Lina had prepared for the worst, she still felt lonely and helpless when facing such a situation.</p></div>
