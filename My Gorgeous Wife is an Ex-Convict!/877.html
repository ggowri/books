        <h1>Chapter 876</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He narrowed his eyes. "Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because that was the only dignity she had left! Though her dignity had been trampled to pieces now and it was only a patchwork of those crushed pieces, but&hellip; She did not want to be trampled on again. "Because you're not the kind of family I want. You can be a creditor, a stranger, or my immediate boss, but there's no way you can be my family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word &lsquo;family&rsquo; was special to her. It was what she had longed for all her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, there was no way she was going to let that word get trampled on here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her with his sharp gaze that looked like a cold blade, seemingly cutting her raw. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not hide from his eyes but looked at him calmly as if she was silently telling him that he would never be her family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he laughed out of anger. A beautiful smile appeared on the corners of his lips. "Why don't we make a bet? I bet you'll one day ask me to be your family and ask me to call you 'Sis' again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help trembling. He said it with so much certainty as if there would be such a day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's not going to happen." This was the answer she gave him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the rental house, Jason walked out of the building. Terrence was already waiting nearby. As soon as he saw his boss coming out, he quickly stepped forward and asked, "Master Reed, are we going back to Reed Residence now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. What did you find out from those two?" Jason replied faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We only found out that they were hired to attack Miss Cummins. They were told to keep her hospitalized for at least a while. However, they've only contacted the payer through phone and the money was paid directly into their account. They&rsquo;ve never met." Terrence told him about his findings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, if they wanted to find out who was behind this, they would probably need more time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Keep looking," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Terrence. Then, he and Jason got into the car together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Send someone to keep an eye on her so that she doesn&rsquo;t find herself in danger again like what happened today. Also, check if she's gotten into conflict with anyone lately," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence quickly responded again. Looking at his boss' perfect profile as he looked out the car window, he could not help but sigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Master Reed can't get over Grace after all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I wonder what kind of magic Grace has. Master Reed can't even get over her or let her go after the breakup!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a sleepless night, Grace went to work the next day with two dark circles around her eyes. She told Lawyer Carter about the results of her interview with Elise Dean and Pansy Dittman yesterday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter agreed with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, because of the lack of key evidence, they could mention it in court but whether it would be accepted was up to the judge.</p></div>
