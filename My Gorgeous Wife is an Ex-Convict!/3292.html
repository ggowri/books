        <h1>Chapter 3290</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, really?" Brian raised his eyebrows, clearly understanding. "Did you and Lina talk about hugging Kering when you meet him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, when you meet an actor you usually only see on TV or in movies, especially one you like, you naturally want to get closer to them," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about you? You seemed to like Kering before. You even watched his recent TV drama multiple times on your iPad, didn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I really thought that drama was good, and Kering played his character well," Valda said matter-of-factly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean by 'played his character well'?" Brian leaned in, his voice becoming lower.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda suddenly realized something was off when she met Brian's intense gaze. "I...I was just speaking as a regular audience member."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, just a regular audience member..." he drawled, almost smiling. "So, as a regular audience member, are you planning to hug him too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course not," she said. "I'm not even a fan of Kering."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't you feel regretful?" he asked, moving his face closer to hers, his lips almost touching her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why would I regret not hugging a celebrity when I have such a handsome husband who I can't even hug enough?" Valda tried to move her head back, but his hand was holding onto the back of her head, preventing her from creating more distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He gave a slight smile and pecked her lips, "Since that's the case, why don't you hug me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Huh?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She paused, "Now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, now," he said. "I just want my dear wife to hug me more, is that too much to ask?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, it's not too much to say." She had a big belly and couldn't really knock him down. Holding him would feel like having a delicious food in front of her, but she could only look and touch, but not eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This feeling of helplessness is also very uncomfortable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda opened her arms and hugged Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian also opened his arms and hugged Valda, being careful not to hold her too tightly and avoid putting pressure on her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then he leaned in close to her ear and whispered, "It's really a test of self-control, isn't it? In the future, you'll have to make it up to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda understood immediately, because for her, it was also a test!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," she blushed and took the initiative to kiss him on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although I can't actually taste it, hmm... I think I can still give it a try and have a little taste.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the day of the premiere, Valda brought not only a group of close girlfriends but also Brian to attend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In addition, Hadwin also showed up, which was a bit unexpected for Valda. However, Hadwin got his ticket from Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda whispered to Lina, "Didn't you say your husband wasn't coming?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, we had agreed that he wouldn't come, but who knew he suddenly cancelled his previously scheduled work and decided to come here," Lina said with a frustrated expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Didn't you say he wasn't interested in art films?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina said helplessly, "He's not interested in art films, but he's afraid I'll be too interested."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda understood, "Are they afraid you are too enthusiastic about Kering?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hehe." Lina chuckled awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the movie started, the women sat in a row with Valda and Lina on either side, while their respective husbands sat next to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda whispered to Brian, "Did you prepare a ticket for Hadwin too? Why didn't you say so beforehand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was going to say it that day, but then...I forgot because I helped you change clothes," Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face turned red instantly, and she couldn't help but recall the scene from earlier. If it weren't for her stomach ache, they would have...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stop, stop! Don't think about it anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She reminded herself in her mind, then focused her attention and started watching the movie.</p></div>
