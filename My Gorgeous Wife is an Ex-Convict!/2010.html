        <h1>Chapter 2008</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked up and saw a man and a woman walking in with a little boy about the same height as Nelson. The child's exposed wounds seemed much less severe than Nelson's. In comparison, Nelson should be the one who should have gone to the infirmary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The man who spoke up before looked at Grace and the others with haughtiness and disdain, while the woman next to him said, "You want to use the law against us? Okay, I'll send our lawyer over and see who's in the right."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The class teacher hurried forward to flatter them with compliments. They looked obsequious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy even made faces at Nelson Corbyn, behaving arrogantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn's drooping hands at his sides clenched tighter, and his little face flushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's anger rose, and she immediately said, "Okay, let's go to court and see who's right. Nelson lost his hearing aid. We're not going to let this go so easily!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said, "What's the matter? Do you want to blame the issue of the hearing aid on us? He lost his hearing aid himself, yet you want us to take the fall for it? It was Nelson Corbyn who deliberately beat up my son. My son kindly helped him pick up his hearing aid and was beaten. Now, instead of getting an apology, he&rsquo;s being criticized. Hmph, I heard Nelson Corbyn's mom has been to prison. They probably think they're all that. Like mother like son!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla turned ghastly pale as soon as she heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson could not hear anything, but he could read lips. He instantly got furious and wanted to rush forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson would have rushed up had it not been for Kyla holding her son back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace turned to Nelson and said, "Nelson, what happened? If you're the one who started the fight, I'll apologize to them with you. If you didn't do it and are being wronged, I&rsquo;ll get you justice!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn stared blankly at Grace in front of him, who had been helping him since he met Grace at a very young age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'My dream is to become a lawyer like aunt Cummins, who can help people who were wronged like Mommy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Now, I'm being wronged by my teacher, my classmates, and my classmates&rsquo; parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But aunt Cummins is... willing to trust me. aunt Cummins's eyes are telling me that she will believe whatever I say as long as I tell the truth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'aunt Cummins's a lawyer. aunt Cummins can get me... justice! But won&rsquo;t Mommy be sadder if she finds out about the truth?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His classmate&rsquo;s parents sneered. "Do you expect a deaf person to speak to you when he has lost his hearing aid? How good can the son of an ex-convict be?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What did you say? What do you mean by an ex-convict? It was a court misjudgment. I can sue you for slander for talking like that!" scolded Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What slander? Has she never been in prison? Even if the court misjudged, it was her own fault. She was too suspicious that the court made a misjudgment. Otherwise, why would the court misjudge her but not others?" They started victim-blaming.</p></div>
