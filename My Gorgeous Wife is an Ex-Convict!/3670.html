        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What a coincidence, didn't expect to run into you here." William spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger looked at William, "It's still early, why don't we hang out here together for a bit?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No thanks, we have some things to take care of and need to leave." William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Roger's gaze shifted to Jasper's face, "Don't forget about the thing you promised me today, I'll be waiting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pursed her lips, "I know." Then she pulled William's hand and walked out of the bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The group of people surrounding Roger said, "Roger, what's your relationship with Miss. Reed? She came to the bar to find you last time too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We don't have much of a relationship, just acquaintances from before." Roger said </span><span>indifferently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Acquaintances from before? Well, you're both from the overseas elite Elliott family, so it's normal to know Miss. Reed. But it's a shame, this princess already has a boyfriend, and the Barlow family that William is from is not ordinary in Deer Capital!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When this was said, the beautiful girl next to Roger showed a suspicious expression, "She already has a boyfriend, what's the shame?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why isn't it a shame? Last time Roger even got Miss. Reed to dump William and be with him. If this Grand Princess didn't have a boyfriend, who knows, she might agree, you never know!" One of the guys said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl's face turned slightly unpleasant upon hearing this, and the boy seemed to realize he had said something wrong and stopped talking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl turned to Roger and asked, "Do you want to date Miss. Reed?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I wouldn't mind giving it a try," Roger replied with a slight smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl was clearly taken aback by Roger's frank answer and felt embarrassed. "If you want to date other women, why did you bring me here to play?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You asked me to bring you along, didn't you?" Roger replied casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you take me for? A spare tire?" the girl asked, feeling even more embarrassed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're not a spare tire," Roger said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl's face brightened, but the next thing he said made her blush with anger. "I never intended to find a spare tire. Between us, it's just a casual fling," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl was furious and raised her hand to slap Roger's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next moment, her hand was intercepted by him in mid-air. His once delicate eyes were now icy cold as he stared at her. "You don't have the right to slap me!" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl felt a chill run down her spine and was suddenly filled with terror.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving the bar, Jasper and William walked out. William asked, "What did Roger ask you to do earlier?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's an invitation to Jasmine's birthday party," Jasper replied. "He wants to come to the party too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, William seemed to be pondering something. "So, are you planning to forgive him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm," she nodded. "If he's willing to let go of his hatred, then that would be the best outcome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But what if he can't let go?" William asked. "Aren't you afraid he might do something at Jasmine's birthday party?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment of silence, Jasper spoke up. "There will be Reed family bodyguards and surveillance at the party. If he tries anything, he'll be caught. Besides..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper paused. "He should hate me, not Jasmine. She has nothing to do with it."</span></p></div>
