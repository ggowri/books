        <h1>Chapter 3013</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The staff cleverly noticed Valda's gaze and immediately brought over the purple dress. They then said to Valda, "Miss Theller, do you like this dress? It's our latest style, designed by a new and innovative French designer who won a design award earlier this year..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at this dress, with its simple design, carrying a French-style elegance and romance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The staff placed the dress in front of Valda and checked it in the mirror. Then they asked, "Miss Theller, would you like to try it on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked over at Brian and asked, "What do you think of this dress?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It looks very nice," he said, but his deep gaze made it hard for her to read his emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seems that... she often wears her emotions on her face, allowing him to easily read her thoughts with just one glance. However, his expressions only reveal his thoughts when he chooses to let her guess. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he is unwilling, then she simply cannot guess his thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda asked the staff to bring the dress and accompany her to the fitting room to try it on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had a few purple dresses before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simply because purple is harder to match with clothes, so there are fewer items of this color in the wardrobe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But ever since she started dating Brian, it seems like purple has disappeared from her wardrobe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And now, as Valda looks at herself in the mirror, wearing this purple evening gown, she feels a sense of confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Purple... Does she really want to wear this purple dress? Or is she just trying to prove that when she wears purple, it no longer represents Grace's exclusive color in Brian's mind?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But how can one's emotions be represented by the color of a dress?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she really wore a purple formal dress to attend the banquet, so what? It doesn't mean that Brian's love for Grace has decreased, nor does it mean that his feelings for her have become deeper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, in the end, it's just self-deception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Theller, you look very pretty in this dress. Would you like to go out and show it to Mr. Hart?" said the staff member next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at herself in the mirror, then turned to the staff and said, "I think I still prefer the beige dress I saw earlier. I want to try that one on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The staff immediately responded, "Okay, please wait a moment. I'll go get it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Valda changed into the dress and walked out of the dressing room to Brian, he was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? Doesn't it look good?" Valda looked down at her dress and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it looks great. It's just that didn't you go to try on the purple dress?" Brian asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was going to try on that dress, but when I put it on, it didn't look as good as I imagined, so I changed into this one instead," Valda explained, turning around in front of Brian. "Do you really think it looks good?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, it looks good." He wasn't lying. The dress made her look cute and gentle, giving people a sense of intimacy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then let's wear this dress to the banquet. I really like it," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian hesitated, "Are you sure you don't want the purple dress? If you still care about it, then I..."</p></div>
