        <h1>Chapter 2429</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There shouldn't be any problem with the bodyguards looking after them. Or I can get Philip Barlow to come here and look after the kids." With that said, he pulled out his phone and called Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was instantly speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While on the phone with Philip Barlow, Jason simply said, "We have a lead on Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s whereabouts. Grace and I are going to check on the situation. Why don't you come over and continue having fun with the three children? Think of it as a father-son bonding trip. You can be a guide to my two children as well.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, the call ended. Jason said to Grace, "Philip Barlow will be here in a minute. He&rsquo;ll probably arrive by the time the boat gets to the shore.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three little ones were looking in their direction. Jasper was the first to ask, "Where are you going?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We have something important to do. Uncle Barlow will take you around later. Jasper and Mick, be good and obedient to Uncle Barlow," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you guys going to find Amber Mitchell?" Mick Reed asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Grace knew it, she heard her son say, "I want to go with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Someone&rsquo;s hiding Aunt Amber Mitchell and we&rsquo;re going to find her, but this is an adult matter. You're a child. Wouldn't it be better for you to play with Jasper and William?" Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I find it more interesting to find people," said Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it a game of hide-and-seek?" Jasper Reed's eyes lit up. She was interested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a headache, Grace could only explain to the kids that she was not playing games but saving lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the boat reached the shore, Philip Barlow had already arrived. Jasper and William were more inclined to continue playing. Jasper had made a list for today's trip. There were still many delicious foods she had to try. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mick Reed really wanted to follow his parents to find Amber Mitchell, so Jason eventually said, "Let Mr. Barlow take care of Jasper and William. Mick can follow us. Sorry for the trouble, Mr. Barlow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing." Philip Barlow smiled. After all, touring Deer City with his son and future daughter-in-law was no trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mick Reed got into the car with his parents and turned on his mini laptop along the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The laptop was specially customized by Jason and was meant for children. It was only about eight inches, but its functions were far better than ordinary laptops.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The mini laptop was easy to carry around and could fit into the little one's bag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she sat in the back with her son, Grace watched as her son's fingers tapped away on the keyboard of the mini laptop. Then, maps of various sizes popped up on the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, are we going to the Mitchell family's mansion on Luhe Mountain?" Mick Reed asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. "How did you know?" When she got into the car, she had only given Jason the location Brian sent her. At most, Mick would have only heard the location, but he knew it was a mansion on Luhe Mountain. Brian had only told her that on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just needed to check which properties are related to the Mitchell family in the area we're going to," Mick Reed said matter-of-factly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was speechless. Why did it sound like a piece of cake when her son said that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What does the mansion look like?" Grace asked curiously.</p></div>
