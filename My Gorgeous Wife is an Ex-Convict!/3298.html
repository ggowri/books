        <h1>Chapter 3296</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace said to her daughter, "Mommy needs to go to the office for a bit. The driver will take you home, and when you get there, make sure to do your homework, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand," said Jasper. His mom's job often has unexpected events, so he's used to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace gave a few instructions to the driver before changing cars and heading towards the law firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The driver was driving towards the Reed family's villa when Jasper suddenly said to him, "Uncle Zack, can we go to Lawrence's house? I want to give him a music score."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is the sheet music she learned today, and she also wants Lawrence to take a look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This..." the driver hesitated, as the madam had previously instructed him to take the young lady directly to the Reed House.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It'll only take a moment, won't take much time. I'll just give him the sheet music and have a quick chat with Lawrence," she said. She had missed Lawrence, it had been a few days since she had seen him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The driver hesitated, but eventually agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Jasper is also the master! He doesn't want to offend Jasper because of this matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's face immediately lit up with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car quickly arrived at the Abbott family's residence, and the driver accompanied Jasper to their home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as they were about to arrive, the door of the Abbott family opened and a pair of strangers walked out, muttering to themselves. "Your family is nothing but a bunch of scoundrels. You keep saying that you have a good relationship with the Reed family and that they are your backing. Do you really think you can climb up the Reed family's ladder just by relying on your son? It's a shame that you tried to use the Reed family to make money and pay off your gambling debts, but ended up humiliating yourselves!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, Wilona's voice came from inside the room, "I relied on my son to climb up to the Reed family, so what! Don't try to bring me down. As long as my son pleases Jasper, our family won't be short of money. I'll be waiting for you to come and apologize to me and make amends!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're just dreaming!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think the Reed family are all fools? Can't we see that you have ulterior motives?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They shouted a few more insults at the unfamiliar man and woman before walking away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Standing nearby, Jasper listened to all of this and felt a chill run through his body, as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, Lawrence is only friends with her because she is Jasper from the Reed family? Is it because his family wants to use the Reed family's reputation to get rich?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Jasper is still young, at the age of 10, he already knows quite a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just like in class, there are many students who try to please her on purpose. They will try to find ways to give her gifts and hope to receive an invitation card from her on her birthday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She naturally has a way of discerning who genuinely wants to be her friend and who doesn't.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Lawrence... from the beginning, she didn't make a distinction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because she enjoys Lawrence's pure and melodious piano playing, she has always believed that someone who can produce such beautiful music cannot have bad intentions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the words she just heard were breaking her understanding.</p></div>
