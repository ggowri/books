        <h1>Chapter 776</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." His answer once again made her have mixed feelings!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you do that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" He suddenly raised his arms, almost holding her carefully in his embrace. "What about you? Why did you want to go to a doctor to hypnotize you? Do you want to restore the memory of you and Brian? Are you that attached to that memory? You've spent only a day together when you were little, and now you have me by your side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was so calm. It was as if he was just talking about a common thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it sounded so frightening to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He even knows that... Brian and I only spent one day together! It&rsquo;s as if he knows everything and I&rsquo;m the only one who didn&rsquo;t!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He seemed to feel her body going stiff and held her tighter in his arms. His lips were close to her ear as he continued to whisper, "Don't seek for that memory again. Isn't it enough that you have me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No. I don't have to restore that memory. I've decided to bury it all and keep it as my little secret.' "Brian and I&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had just started talking when he interrupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough. Stop! I don't want to hear what's going on between you and Brian!" He held her firmly in his arms, not wanting to hear her saying things he did not want to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, listen... Listen to me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As I said, I don't want to hear anything going on between you and Brian! I don't care what happened to you and him on the hill yesterday. I can take it as nothing has happened, but from now on, don't have any contact with him! Don't place him in your heart. Don&rsquo;t mention him, think of him, or miss him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His arms seemed to want to embed her completely into his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was as far as he could go! He never thought he would concede so far for a woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His pride and dignity were being destroyed by her little by little, but he still wanted her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'My body... hurts!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt as though she was about to go out of breath as Jason hugged her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what hurt her more was what he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't believe me?" She tried her best to raise her chin in his arms as if desperately wanting to see the man in front of her who she loved most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does he not believe... me when I explained it to him yesterday?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or does he simply not believe in my love?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it matter?" He lowered his head, and their eyes met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were so deep that she could not see them clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately felt her heart throb with pain. 'Was my explanation yesterday as well as my fears and resolutions not important to him at all?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, let's call it a day," he said, taking her by the hand and leading her into the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On a counter in the kitchen was a cake with most of the piping done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it look good? Your birthday cake will be ready in a little while. If you don't want to eat breakfast, you can have lunch with me later," he said with a chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the same tone of voice and the same smile. Everything looked the same as usual.</p></div>
