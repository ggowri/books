        <h1>Chapter 1642</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The news? Do you let her watch such news?" said Grace as she raised her eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why... Why would I show her such news? Maybe she saw it when she was playing with my phone," Irene Lynch said with a dry laugh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It seems Oriel knows a lot of words. She can even read news articles at this age. Why don't I find a news article and see if Oriel can figure out what it's about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Well... there are news videos!" Irene Lynch said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said coldly, "Videos? Then find me a news video online that mentions the word 'homewrecker'?" The word &lsquo;homewrecker&rsquo; would only be found in the comments section. Those videos dared not mention it, and it would be cut out even if they did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was very clear about this because she had already asked Jay to get rid of radical remarks and videos that slandered Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, Hadwin Stephenson probably had someone remove those related videos as well. There was no way one could find it online. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was even less news online about the previous incident on the streets. Almost all of it had been removed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace would not believe that a kid like Oriel Lynch had just randomly clicked open those sorts of videos!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch looked even more embarrassed and quickly changed the subject, saying, "But... Jasper shouldn't have pulled Oriel's hair out no matter what. We don't know if the hair will grow back! If it doesn't&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Then we&rsquo;ll get a doctor to check on her. I'll pay for all the expenses."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'That's it?' Irene Lynch was unwilling, especially with all the teachers in the office. If she gave in to Grace now, these teachers would only think less of her and her daughter in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, Irene Lynch asked, "Shouldn't Jasper apologize to Oriel?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, we&rsquo;ll let the kids apologize to each other," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Apologize to each other?" In Irene Lynch's opinion, her daughter was seriously injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The kids fought and each of them is at fault. Jasper was wrong for pulling Oriel's hair, but she did it to defend her mother and aunt. And Oriel... shouldn't have said such a thing. She's also a member of the Reed family. She doesn't know what all for one and one for all means but don't you? You should teach your child that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What Grace said made Irene Lynch almost powerless to refute. Grace mentioned the Reed family. Irene Lynch would be unreasonable if she insisted on not letting her daughter apologize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch could only grit her teeth and reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two children apologized to each other reluctantly, and Grace turned around to talk to the teacher. Then, she brought the two children home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mommy, I'm sorry I didn't take good care of Tristas!" Mick Reed apologized as soon as they got in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I'm fine. Brother took good care of me!" Jasper Reed&rsquo;s braids which she had done this morning were now as messy as a bird's nest. There were even two bruises on her face, and her clothes were askew with one button missing.</p></div>
