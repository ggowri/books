        <h1>Chapter 1632</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, instead of telling the driver to stop, he said, "If you really wanted to distance yourself from me, you would've slapped me when I dragged you into the car. Isn't it a little late to say these now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Lina glared at him. "I'm already unfortunate enough. What on earth do you want? Aren't you afraid of your girlfriend misunderstanding you if you do this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stared at Lina with an unfathomable look in his eyes. "Does it matter whether she misunderstands? Will you believe me if I say that I never had feelings for her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was stunned. She stared blankly at Hadwin Stephenson. After some time, she seemed to come to her senses and said, "Are you only dating her for... power and the sake of your career?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He pressed his thin lips slightly and made no reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not ask again. She thought that he probably got together with Katherine Jackson because he wanted better prospects for his career. However, they had been together for five years and were going to get married, so he should have some feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Why would he marry someone he did not love, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment though, he was telling her he had no feelings for Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car drove toward a more and more remote place. Lina was suddenly surprised. "Where are you taking me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We're going somewhere safe. Something might happen soon, so you'd better stay away," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't want to stay away. I want to go home. Hadwin Stephenson, tell the driver to stop!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The car's not going to stop. Lina, I just want you safe and sound," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina retorted, "Safe and sound? Is this how you make me safe and sound? By taking me somewhere against my will?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Believe me for once!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She suddenly laughed. "Hadwin Stephenson, have you ever thought that I could&rsquo;ve been safe and sound if you hadn't shown up in front of me? If you hadn't shown up and we hadn't fallen in love, I wouldn't have gotten seriously injured and ended up in the ICU. If you hadn't shown up this time and dragged me to a hotel room, what happened today wouldn&rsquo;t have happened either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's face instantly turned ghastly pale. A hint of pain flashed through his eyes. However, it flashed so quickly that Lina did not even see it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked down a little and said in a faint voice, "Even if you don't like it, you'll have to stay away for a few days. Everything will come to an end after a few days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His words left no room for negotiation, and Lina could not figure out what Hadwin Stephenson was up to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Was he afraid that she would say something in front of the press and affect his marriage, so he wanted her to &lsquo;stay away&rsquo;? Was there something else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was silent for the rest of the journey. Neither of them spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The destination was an ordinary residential community. Although it was remote and in the suburbs, many people from tMason Swansonty would buy houses here because they were cheap. Therefore, the place was bustling in the evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson brought Lina to an apartment and said to Lina, "Stay here for a few days. You can ask for leave from work. Once things come to an end in a few days, you can leave and lead a normal life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Come to an end?" Lina frowned and asked, "What end? Are you going to find the person who took these photos? Or ask the verified account that caused the incident to go viral online to give a public apology? Hadwin Stephenson, I want to live a normal life, so please leave me alone from now on, okay?"</p></div>
