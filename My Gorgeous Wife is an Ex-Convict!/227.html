        <h1>Chapter 226</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the man moved closer and closer, his face became clearer and clearer in the camera.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace caught a glimpse of the man on camera, the rice in her mouth that she had barely swallowed nearly burst out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It... It was Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Jason on camera was in a black suit. He was tall, and his hair was neat. He looked like an elegant, dashing young man. Perhaps the only things that stood out were the scarf around his neck and the gloves of the same color on his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They... did not look right with this suit at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Here on the influencer's live stream show, the people watching were already flooding the screen with comments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who is this man?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He doesn't look like a celebrity, but he's so handsome. Oh my God, I'm going to fall completely under his spell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh my God, is he really not a celebrity? I&rsquo;ll be a huge fan if he ever debuts!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Quick, go up there and interview him! Say something, it's killing me!" The others urged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The influencer grinned at the phone's camera. "Then let's go and do an interview. I hope this gentleman is willing to talk to us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only took a few steps forward to find that the photographer holding the mobile phone did not follow her. She turned back and jokingly said, "Come on, is our cameraman too tired to walk already?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That... That's Jason. That man is Jason..." A quivering voice sounded from the cameraman behind the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" The influencer was surprised. She looked incredulous as she glanced at Jason again. Then, she yelled in a panicked voice, "Quick. Cut the video. Stop filming!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was already too late. The audience was already in an uproar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who was Jason? It was very clear to many people. After all, their food, clothing, housing, and transportation usually involved the Reed family's business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason did not like to be photographed, so there was an unwritten rule in the media. Even if you did shoot Jason, you could only shoot his vague distant figure or back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It could be said that this influencer had captured Jason's full face in crystal clear quality. Furthermore, it was taken in the form of a video during a live stream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh my God, so Jason looks like this! He's so good looking!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Please take my knee."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's my husband, and I'm hell-bent on my husband!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No one can steal my husband!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All sorts of comments were flooding the screen until the live stream was eventually turned off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, not long after that, Grace found a video that recorded Jason's live stream earlier. There were already a lot of comments on it. Apart from comments about Jason's beauty, there was also curiosity about Jason's departure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A lot of people were talking about Jason's early departure. Some were even careful to analyze Jason's steps in the video with a series of data. It was faster than a normal person's walking pace, so it could be something urgent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for what the emergency was, some people discussed whether there was something wrong with the Reed Group or if there was something wrong with Old Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Old Master Reed's long hospital stay had been reported in the media and was well known to many.</p></div>
