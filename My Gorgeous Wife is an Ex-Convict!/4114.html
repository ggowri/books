        <h1>Chapter 4112</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Hadwin shut his mouth and stopped talking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina took command and said to her daughter and future son-in-law, "You two, sit down first before you speak!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina and Chandler obediently sat back in their seats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina then asked, "You two aren't married yet. What if you get pregnant?" It was a very practical question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina couldn't help but think to herself that she actually wanted to get pregnant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she couldn't answer like that in front of her mother, so she said, "I will take responsibility!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What responsibility will you take?" Hadwin glared at his disappointing daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina's shoulders couldn't help but shrink, but she persisted, "Of course, I will take responsibility for marrying Chandler as soon as possible!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're still in college!" Hadwin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can still get married while in college!" Tina muttered, after all, there are people who get married while in college!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler spoke up, "There won't be anything like this happening again before Tina and I get married. As for the wedding date, it's up to the Stephenson family. If Tina is willing to marry me, I will take good care of her for the rest of my life. If Tina doesn't want to, I will still bless her and won't force her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler naturally understood Hadwin's concerns because he had the same worries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He was afraid that Tina was too young and might not be able to distinguish her feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He was afraid that she might mistake their years of companionship for love and regret the marriage if she met someone she truly loved after getting married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After hearing Chandler's words, Hadwin's expression eased, "Can Hunter agree to what you said?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You don't have to worry about Hunter. I can make the decision!" Chandler said directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was angry and stared at Chandler, "Chandler, do you still think I will regret getting married to you? Do you really not trust my feelings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina, I just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina suddenly stood up and walked to Chandler, who was still sitting in his chair. She looked down at him and said, "Although I'm eight years younger than you, I know my own feelings. I know who I want to spend the rest of my life with. Your constant search for a way out only makes me feel that you are not the one who loves me enough!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After saying this, she turned to her parents and said, "Mom and Dad, whether I marry Chandler or not, I will have his child. There will be a child of Chandler and me in this world, and you will be grandparents no matter what!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After speaking, she didn't look at anyone's reaction and went straight upstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin and Lina were surprised. What did she mean? Did she want to have a child even if they didn't get married?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Is Tina really not pregnant?" Hadwin stared at Chandler and began to suspect that his daughter was already pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina quickly said, "I'll confirm it later. Don't be angry. Chandler has made everything clear, and he has given the decision-making power to the Stephenson family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina was still very satisfied with her future son-in-law!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He is willing to take responsibility, but he won't force Tina. On the contrary, his own daughter is more willful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only Chandler understands the true meaning behind Tina's words just now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was telling him that no matter what, she will save him, right?!</p></div>
