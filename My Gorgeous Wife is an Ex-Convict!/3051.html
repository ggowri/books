        <h1>Chapter 3049</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, the phone is on speaker mode, and everyone in the living room can hear the conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So Valda, once the money is received tomorrow, I will naturally tell you where the child is, but only you are allowed to come and take the child away, no one else can follow." Phoebe's voice came out ominously from the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda replied. "I can come alone, but right now I need to know if Jasmine is safe. Otherwise, the ransom won't be transferred to the designated account. Unless you have a video call with me right now and show me Jasmine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Believe it or not, it's up to you. Anyway, we won't get the money tomorrow, and this child shouldn't expect to live!" Phoebe said viciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Jason stepped forward and spoke to Phoebe on the other end of the phone, "If you really want money, just let me know. My daughter is safe and sound now, and all I want is for her to be safe. Money is not a problem. But if anything happens to my daughter, I will not let you go, even if you flee to another country!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's threat made Phoebe stay silent on the other end of the phone. After a moment, she finally responded with a simple "Okay. Before the transaction tomorrow, I'll show you what you want to see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing speaking, the call ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to the short amount of time and current technological limitations, it is difficult to track down the specific location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On Phoebe's side, it was clear that she was aware of this and kept the timing within this specific time frame.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at Valda and said, "They want you to pick up the kids tomorrow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Valda nodded, "I didn't expect Phoebe to call me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, among the people present, she and Jasmine could be considered the ones with the least close relationship. Therefore, logically speaking, even if someone had to go pick up the child, it wouldn't be her turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Phoebe was designated and only she can pick up the child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pursed his lips and said, "Can't it be someone else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda shook her head and said, "Brian also told Phoebe earlier that he would pick up the children tomorrow, but they rejected his offer!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, it means that Valda is the only option for picking up the child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason squinted his eyes, what does this mean? If those two women had made various arrangements beforehand, then they must have had a reason for choosing Valda to pick up the child, rather than doing it randomly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tomorrow when you go to pick up your child, it could be dangerous. Why don't you find someone to dress up as you and go pick up your child instead?" Brian suddenly suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Phoebe and Whitney both know me, but for such a short time. Where can they find someone who looks like me that they can't tell apart?" Valda said. "I'm going to pick up the kids tomorrow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian wanted to say something else, but Jason beat him to it and said, "Let's leave it at that. I'll arrange for some people to discreetly follow Valda and ensure her safety."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the other party has made this request, and currently, there is no other feasible solution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying these words, Jason looked at Valda solemnly and said, "Valda, by helping me this time, you have done me a huge favor. The Reed family will do everything in our power to help you in the future, no matter what kind of help you need."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This is Jason's promise, and in Emerald City, how many people can get a promise like this from him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If someone else had obtained it, they would probably be overjoyed, but Valda simply said, "You don't have to feel like you owe me anything. Grace and I are friends, so it's only natural for me to help in a situation like this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace approached Valda with gratitude and tightly grabbed her hand. "Valda, thank you, really thank you! I know... if you went to pick up the child, there might be danger, but... but I..."</p></div>
