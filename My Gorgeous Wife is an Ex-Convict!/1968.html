        <h1>Chapter 1966</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't remove them," he said as he took out a lighter and lit the digit candles that had been inserted into the cake the night before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The candlelight flickered as Lina looked blankly at Hadwin Stephenson and asked, "Aren't... you going to make a wish?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, she suddenly found it redundant once the words were out of her mouth. 'It's already past his birthday. What wish can he make?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do wishes come true?" He fixed his eyes on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Who knows?" she asked. 'Though... it's past his birthday.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes fell on the cake. Every year for the past five years, all he had ever wished on his birthday was that he could be with her one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does this mean my wish has come true? How much better would it have been if she never wanted a clean break with me and tried to get rid of the baby?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, do you think my wish will come true?" He croaked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She froze for a moment before saying, "I... hope it'll come true."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He slowly closed his eyes as if he was making a wish in his head. Lina stared blankly at him, guessing what kind of wish he would make.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When he opened his eyes and blew out the candles, he cut a slice of cake and began to eat it mouthful after mouthful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina quickly cut a slice of cake as well and began eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although the cake was kept overnight, it still tasted pretty good. Lina was eating when she suddenly heard Hadwin Stephenson's voice. "If I don't forgive you in a month, will you really return to Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina stopped eating the cake. Her expression turned gloomy, but she still looked up and forced a smile at Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not want to look sad while eating his birthday cake. "Yes, I'll return to Emerald City and won't bother you again. If you want to acknowledge our child, you can come to Emerald City to see them at any time. If you don't, I won't tell them who their father is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What about your future? Are you going to live your life as a single mother?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why do you make it sound so pathetic? I have my parents who'll live with me and our child. Besides... maybe I'll have a new family someday. Don't worry!" She laughed, deliberately making it sound light-hearted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was no way she would start a new family with another man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If it were so easy to fall in love with someone else, she would have gotten married in the past five years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, his face darkened as she spoke. "Lina, you're really carefree. You keep pestering me but you've already prepared a plan B for yourself, haven&rsquo;t you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I&mdash;" Before she could explain, he interrupted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, you're still as heartless as back then. Are you going to mess up other people's feelings, let them fall madly in love with you, and then walk away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina blinked, stunned. 'Uh... I don't suppose he meant himself when he said &lsquo;other people&rsquo;, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is he saying that because... he's madly in love with me right now?'</p></div>
