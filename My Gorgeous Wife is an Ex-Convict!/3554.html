        <h1>Chapter 3552</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He pursed his lips, seeming a bit surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, she had picked out the noodles she wanted to eat, then got up to grab some chopsticks and condiments for the self-serve station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And what about you? Do you hate me?" She asked again, referring to her previous question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyelashes fluttered slightly. "What if I do hate you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So please bear with me for a while, and later..." Her voice paused, "I can guarantee that I won't appear in front of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Later, what later?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If later you really feel that I can't be your friend, then I won't appear in front of you," she said, while the unspoken words in her heart were - if later she was sure he wasn't Lawrence, then she could stop appearing in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if you really hate me, why did you bring me to the lab and have dinner with me?" She suddenly thought of this and couldn't help but ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No reason, just bored," he casually gave an answer, "But you better not get too close to me, it's not good for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words sounded like a warning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the waiter brought over the noodles they had ordered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger began eating the noodles with his head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper stared at the person in front of him, who was also eating a bowl of noodles with vegetables and pork chops, just like Lawrence did - first the noodles, then the vegetables and pork chops.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was this just a coincidence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or maybe, many people have this habit, eating the noodles first and then the toppings?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I don't know what happened, but when she thought he might be Lawrence, she would compare him to the Lawrence in her memory, and then she would feel more and more like he was him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he really is Lawrence, that would be great!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I want to get close to someone, it's definitely not for any benefits," Jasper murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so? But people who get close to me usually don't end up well. Aren't you afraid?" He stopped eating his noodles and looked up at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her heart shook, and in that moment, she saw in his eyes an endless stillness!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing their noodles, Jasper and Roger returned to school together. However, as they approached the school gate, they ran into William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Judging by William's appearance, he had been waiting at the gate for quite some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William," Jasper hurriedly greeted him, "you're not waiting for me, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm," William replied, his gaze passing over Jasper and settling on Roger standing behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he had seen the other person's videos and photos on the school forum before, it was still the first time he saw him face to face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could this boy be Lawrence? William also had such a guess in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Indeed, the other person's appearance could make people feel like it was Lawrence grown up. In addition, the piano playing and the mole on the neck that Jasper mentioned...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Are all these just coincidences? Or... is this person really Lawrence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, if it really is Lawrence and the other person hasn't lost their memory or anything, but remembers everything, would deliberately denying being Lawrence have other conspiracies behind it?</p></div>
