        <h1>Chapter 1147</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace arrived at the firm in the morning, all she saw were strange glances from her colleagues and them whispering to each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she looked over at them, her colleagues would all stop talking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace narrowed her eyes. 'What's the matter? Is it about me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was even funnier was that when she went to the pantry, the gossipy female colleagues in the office said to her, "Grace, congratulations! It seems that your hard times are going to be over soon. Don't forget us when you're rich!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you congratulating me?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the woman only gave a look as if to say &lsquo;You know, I know&rsquo; and pressed her lips together into a smile. "Stop playing dumb. It's all over the internet now, and everyone's so envious of you! But there are many women out there who are eyeing the crown prince. You gotta be careful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no idea what she was talking about. The only certain thing was that Brian seemed to have something to do with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just before Grace could ask any further questions, she had already left the pantry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The internet?' Grace thought for a while. She was about to take out her phone to surf the internet when another person walked into the pantry. Grace looked up and found that it was Andrea Schwartz.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz had been doing miserably during this period. She would basically be alone in the firm and dared not say anything to her colleagues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had a boyfriend who was about to marry her but was seeing other men. After the video of her getting hit was exposed online last time, not only did she lose her boyfriend, but she was even despised by many of her colleagues in the firm. Even the head of the firm had spoken to her several times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz held a grudge against Grace. She felt that if it were not for Grace, such a thing would not have happened to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The firm had not dismissed Andrea Schwartz, but they were certainly not going to renew the contract with her once it expired this year. She probably would not be able to make it in the lawyer world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The hatred in Andrea Schwartz's eyes was even more evident at the sight of Grace. She sarcastically said, "Grace, don't be proud of yourself. Do you think you can join the Hart family by snagging Brian? How can the Hart family accommodate a woman like you who has been to prison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave Andrea Schwartz a cold glance and did not immediately speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Andrea Schwartz thought she had hit her where it hurt, so she spoke more eagerly, "Maybe you can write a memoir about your time in prison? It may sell well. I hear lots of nasty things go on in prison. Have you ever been forced to dance naked?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more Andrea Schwartz talked, the more sinister her expression became. So what if Grace had turned out to be innocent? Her label as an ex-convict could never be removed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly took out her phone from her pocket, pressed the end recording button, and said to Andrea Schwartz, "Tell me, what will happen to you if I play this recording to Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pressed the play button as she spoke, and what Andrea Schwartz just said sounded from the phone again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz's expression immediately changed, and she looked at Grace with a mixture of bitterness as well as fear. "You tricked me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I haven't done anything! But you&rsquo;re making a lot of effort to harm me!" said Grace. The more you gave in and the more you wanted to make peace with a vile person, the more they would push their luck.</p></div>
