        <h1>Chapter 4172 Suspicious Person</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler answered the call and listened for a moment. His face slightly changed, and he said, "Okay, I'll come over this afternoon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After ending the call, Tina asked, "What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It's about the fire at the factory last time. The investigation report is out. It was a deliberate arson, and the police have arrested a suspect. However, this suspect was also manipulated by someone else, and they can't determine who that person is. So, the police want me to come over." Chandler explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Upon hearing this, Tina immediately said, "Then I'll go with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler looked at Tina and said, "It might be boring."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No, it won't be boring. It's a big matter concerning your factory. And now that we're married, it's my factory too! I care about our 'family' business, so how could it be boring?" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The mention of "family" gave Chandler a special feeling, as if it brought them closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In the afternoon, they arrived at the police station. The police explained the situation regarding the arrested suspect and the fire, and then asked Chandler if he had any enemies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although they couldn't uncover the mastermind behind the suspect, they did get some useful information. When the suspect was contacted by the person using a voice-changing phone, they said something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Since Chandler and that bitch embarrassed me, I'm going to make him suffer too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina listened, furrowing her brow. Bitch? For some reason, she had a feeling that the insult was directed at her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But had she and Chandler done anything to make someone want to seek revenge by humiliating them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler had several competitors in his business, and it was natural for there to be hidden grudges. However, she couldn't think of anything that would warrant being called a bitch or being humiliated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "If I come up with any useful leads, I'll contact the police promptly," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Alright," the police nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As they left the police station, Tina turned to Chandler and asked, "Did we do anything together that would make someone want to humiliate us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why, do you think that the person the suspect referred to as a bitch is you?" Chandler asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Otherwise, have you done something embarrassing with someone else?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not impossible," Chandler thought to himself. He didn't want Tina to be the person behind the arson, because that would mean she could also be the target of that person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If that person has dealt with him now, then they might go after Tina next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I still think it might be related to me," Tina said, wondering if this was a woman's intuition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the way back, Tina couldn't stop thinking about whether she had offended anyone recently. And especially if she had offended someone along with Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If we exclude the people at school, then it would be someone she has encountered in her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In her life...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Tina remembered someone who made her sick to her stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I got it!" she suddenly exclaimed to Chandler. "Could it be Mr. Perkins?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Perkins?" Chandler was puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The one we had dinner with before, the one we met with Kit! Wasn't he planning something inappropriate with Kit, and then I beat him up? And after you arrived, he didn't dare to touch me anymore!" Tina said. "Now that I think about it, Mr. Perkins is highly suspicious!"</p></div>
