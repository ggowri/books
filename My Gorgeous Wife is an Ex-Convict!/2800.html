        <h1>Chapter 2798</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips were pressed together. Her nonchalance made him uncomfortable for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What excuse do you think we can give?" he asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It can be me insisting on getting a divorce because I can't fit in or me not wanting to be a rich madam who only takes care of her husband and children. We can also say that we don't see eye to eye with each other. Our love lost to reality, so we decided to get a divorce. Or... Or maybe I just married you so you could donate me your liver. Since I've achieved my goal, I divorced you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Each of her examples made his face grimmer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would have to bear the blame herself if they used her excuses. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to divorce me so badly that you would slander yourself?" Martin Weiss frowned and asked unhappily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. "We're going to get divorced anyway. If I'm the wrongdoer, it&rsquo;ll cost the Weiss family and you minimal damage, won't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yeah, it would cost him minimal damage, but he was unhappy to hear that from her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, you know you're going to divorce me anyway, so can you stand pretending to be a loving couple with me?" He got up and walked up to her. Suddenly, he bent over with his hands resting on the arms of her chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She instantly felt a rush of pressure overcoming her. The gesture made it seem as if she were trapped in his arms. His eyes were almost level with hers. Their faces were so close to each other's that they could easily feel each other's breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked blankly at the face right in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to back then, he seemed paler and thinner now. He looked faintly sickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was all because he had donated his liver to her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why can't I stand it?" she quietly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her calmness only stung his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face closed in on hers, and his lips almost pressed on hers. "Can you stand doing this in front of people?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyelashes quivered slightly. "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his lips hard against hers and kissed her forcefully. The kiss was so intense it felt like he was venting something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a long time before he finally ended the kiss. He panted as he glared at Kyla. "Can you stand this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was disappointed when she still looked calm. It was as if the kiss was nothing to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, I can take it. I've mentally prepared myself since I made this decision. I can take it even if we have to be intimate with each other in front of others," Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can take it...' Martin Weiss instantly felt an inexplicable sense of fury surging in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, would you still be able to take it if I were another man?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla frowned. "Are you being unreasonable?" That assumption simply did not exist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you said you can take it, let's live together starting tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll prepare a house in Emerald City. It's up to you to decide if the kids and your mother will move over together!" he said as he straightened up and looked at her condescendingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was shocked. "You want to live in Emerald City?" She thought he was only here for a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I&rsquo;ll stay in Emerald City until we get divorced," he replied, giving her a meaningful glance. Then, he looked away. "Get ready."</p></div>
