        <h1>Chapter 3822</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica remained silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper said, "Veronica, why don't you try to be with Mason again? If you two go your separate ways, don't you think it's a pity? It's hard to find a man who is willing to risk his life to save you in this life."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I want to, Mason may not want to," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How do you know if you don't try?" Jasper encouraged her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Veronica decided to give it a try and be with him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Anyway... even if he doesn't want to, they can just continue living as they did after the breakup.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what if... he still has feelings for her? What if he wants to be with her again...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart was filled with anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used to think that as long as he was safe, nothing else mattered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after a few days of recuperation, she found herself really hoping to be with him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, people are always greedy. After getting something, they will want more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the evening, Veronica turned to the two nurses in the ward and said, "Can you step out for a moment? I want to talk to Mason alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two nurses were there to take care of them, so they looked at each other hesitantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica said, "It will only take a little while. You can wait outside the ward. If there's anything, we'll call out and you can hear us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." The two nurses were still hesitant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason spoke up, "You can leave now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." The two nurses finally left the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's ward was originally quite large, but now only Veronica and Mason were left. Veronica suddenly felt a sense of emptiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have something to tell you," Veronica said as she got off the bed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a few days of rest, she could walk now, but Mason was more seriously injured and had one leg in a cast. Even if he wanted to get off the bed, he had to be helped by someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the moment, Mason was still sitting on the bed, his black eyes looking at Veronica. There was a hint of confusion in his eyes, making it hard to guess what he was thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt nervous and oppressed when he stared at her like that. She didn't know when it started.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica took a deep breath and told herself not to be afraid. She saw it as an opportunity for herself. Even if it didn't work out, she wouldn't lose anything, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because...she had nothing left to lose!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to say?" Mason's voice broke the silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...," Veronica hesitated for a moment and said, "I didn't expect Daniel to do something like this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you want to plead for him and get him a light sentence?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Veronica was taken aback, then quickly said, "I didn't think of that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you didn't think of that, then why bring him up?" he said, not looking at her again. "I'm tired and want to rest. If you want to talk about Daniel, I'm not interested."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was speechless. Why did he assume that she must want to talk about Daniel?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just used Daniel as a conversation starter!</span></p></div>
