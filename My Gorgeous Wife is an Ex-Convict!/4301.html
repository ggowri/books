        <h1>Chapter 4299 I Like You, Chandler</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the food was served.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at the unfamiliar dishes in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hadn't tasted these dishes before, but she had a feeling that they would be delicious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because her body still remembered these dishes? Tina wondered to herself as she picked up her fork and tasted the food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Indeed, the taste was quite good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina tasted each dish one by one. They all suited her taste and she ate more than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing the meal, she looked at Chandler</span><span>, saying,</span><span> </span><span>"You really </span><span>know</span><span> </span><span>me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler raised his head slightly. "After all these years of being together, </span><span>of course, I know about you</span><span>."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about drinks? What kind of drink do I like? You didn't order any drinks, did you?" </span><span>S</span><span>e </span><span>curiously asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt like there should be drinks with today's meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You used to like ordering a cocktail, but you've only recently recovered from your illness, so </span><span>it's better not to drink alcohol," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"With my current condition, one drink is fine as long as it's in moderation," Tina said</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"What kind of cocktail do I like? Help me order!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He frowned, but ultimately went along with her request and ordered a cocktail for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The drink was a mixture of red, pink, and deep blue, looking quite beautiful. Tina took a sip. It was sweet, not like alcohol, more like juice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This drink is quite tasty. What's it called?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blue Promise," Chandler replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blue Promise?" Tina gently swirled the glass and took another sip. "A blue rose is a promise to stay together. Did I like the name of this drink in the past?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler stared at Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had said these words before: "A blue rose is a promise to stay together, Chandler. I like the name of this drink."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had no memories of the past, yet she said the same words again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, you liked the name of this drink," he whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina drank her cocktail while resting her head on her hand, looking at Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's true that </span><span>you will like the </span><span>things you used to like again. Even if you </span><span>lose your memory</span><span>, your body still remembers that feeling," she said softly, raising her hand to continue drinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand reached across the table and held hers. "Don't drink anymore, you'll get drunk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At least I'm not drunk yet," Tina said. "But I can stop drinking. Will you finish this drink for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pursed his lips, then took the drink from her hand and finished it in one go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, the drink is finished, and it's about time. Let me take you back," Chandler said, getting up and walking around the table to Tina's side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He extended his hand to support her, afraid that she might be unsteady on her feet due to the alcohol.</span><span> In response,</span><span> Tina leaned on Chandler as they walked out of the restaurant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, you've also been drinking. How are we going back later? Shall we take a taxi?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I arranged for the restaurant to provide a driver," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was surprised. "You can have the restaurant find a driver for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This restaurant is partly owned by the Hunter family," he explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's how it was. Suddenly, she came to a halt and looked up at him seriously. "Chandler, the things I used to like, I can like them again. Not just the drink and the food we have today, but also the people around us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" he froze, only hearing her say, "I like you, Chandler!"</span></p></div>
