        <h1>Chapter 2634</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, even so, it was still a matter of great joy to her. There was something very satisfying about seeing her comics being adapted into a show and played by real people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A company is interested in the adaptation and has decided to invest more money in it. There's a good chance that it&rsquo;ll be broadcasted through satellite and on TV. Besides that, I think I heard they're getting Gloria to play the male lead," Camille Strickland said excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze on the spot. Gloria was a popular celebrity. His acting skills were favored by many people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no TV series that Gloria starred in that did not get broadcasted through satellite! If he was indeed the male lead, there was a real chance the show would be broadcasted through satellite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Valda Theller muttered after some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland said, "Nonsense. Would I tell you fake news? The producer called me. If this series is a hit, then maybe you&rsquo;ll be a hit too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was happy for her best friend. In her opinion, her best friend's work was as good as other popular comic artists. She just needed a little luck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her best friend had been drawing with all her heart over the year. Even though she did not make much money, she was not impatient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were not many people who would strive in the comic industry. Many people would be defeated by reality and think that they could only earn this much money in a month after working so hard. In other industries, they could earn the same amount of money without so much hard work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even knew several comic artists who gave up and ended up holding classes on how to draw comics. The money they made from there was much more than drawing comics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, she admired her best friend's persistence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the TV series could be a hit, it would be a great boost to her best friend's career.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter whether it's a hit, but it would be nice if Gloria stars in it," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland said, "The producer said they&rsquo;re now in talks with his manager. It's a 50-50 chance. Alright, wait for my updates. We'll probably get the result in these couple of days!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," answered Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the phone call, an elegant voice suddenly rang in her ears. "What do you hope Gloria would star in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked up to meet Brian's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"One of my comics is being adapted. I thought it was just going to be a low-budget online drama at first, but some company has invested more money into it. The producer is talking with Gloria's manager, hoping he'll play the male lead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Valda Theller could not help smiling. "How lucky I&rsquo;d be if Gloria really does take the role. Gosh, I&rsquo;m getting kinda excited just thinking about it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you a fan?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller touched her nose. "I guess I'm just an ordinary fan, not a die-hard one. But I've watched every one of his works. He's still young, only 28. But I think he has a bright future ahead of him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked uncertain again as she spoke of it. "But the films Gloria have starred in are all big productions. Even if I get more investment in mine, the show might not be as good as his previous ones. Moreover, I'm not a famous comic artist."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He'll take the role," Brian said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Valda Theller looked at him in surprise. Even Camille said the producer was still discussing with Gloria, and they would only get the results two days later. However, Brian seemed like he already kne how things would turn out.</p></div>
