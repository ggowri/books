        <h1>Chapter 1106</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you... doing here?" Grace looked at Brian in surprise. She noticed that he had lost some weight when he got closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His right hand was still bandaged. Grace recalled how Jason had broken Brian's hand before taking her away. "How's your hand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said lightly, "It's fine. It's just a minor injury. This place was hard to find, though. It wasn't until yesterday when Dr. Russell was brought here that we finally got some clues."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, worry appeared in Brian's eyes again. "Did he give you a hard time after taking you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," said Grace as she shook her head. However, her expression changed slightly after thinking of the time she had spent with Jason these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was uneasy when he saw this. It was as if the possibility he did not want to think about was gradually becoming a reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly tugging Grace's hand with his left hand, Brian said, "I'll take you away now. This mansion has high-level security everywhere. I had someone hack into the system and temporarily shut down some of the security functions, but it won't take long before everything goes back to normal, so let&rsquo;s hurry up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was startled. "Take me away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His phoenix eyes stared at her. "Don't you want to leave?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow, Grace's mind flashed back to the moment last night when Jason knelt in front of her, kissed her instep, and made a vow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, she knew she had fallen for him again. She had fallen for that man. Even if she had been severely hurt by the man, she could not help reconsidering. 'Can we... really be happy if we get back together?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Will he believe and love me as he said he would and never hurt me again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes noticed all her hesitation. He suddenly felt his heart sinking. 'Is she and Jason&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Grace, if we don't leave soon, the security system will go back to normal and we probably won't be able to leave! Do you want Jason to keep you here? I'll take you away first!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But if I go out with Brian like this, then&hellip;' Grace took a deep breath and looked at Brian as she said, "I appreciate that you've been looking for me all these days and that you went to so much trouble to get me out of here, but there are things I want to take care of myself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's not enough time! Wait till we get out! Just because I sneaked in once doesn't mean I can sneak in a second time," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, this was the Reed family's private territory, and some things were beyond his control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you really have something you want to solve by yourself, you can solve it after you go out. I won't let Jason have another chance to lock you up like this!" said Brian as he whisked Grace straight in the direction of the exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want her to stay here any longer. It was as if he would lose this woman if he left without her this time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the woman he had fallen in love with for the first time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was selfish and cowardly. He dared not gamble that she could solve the problem by herself and whether she would be with Jason or not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she and Jason were in love once!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace staggered along with Brian almost passively. "Brian, listen to me. I really&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could finish her sentence, Brian suddenly stopped in his tracks. Grace almost ran into Brian's back.</p></div>
