        <h1>Chapter 94</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then I guess he is going to lose all his money," Brian said. From the corner of his eyes, he caught a glimpse of a figure who was looking around the banquet hall. "She's here. Should I introduce you to her?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason's eyes turned in the direction of Brian Hart's gaze, and the corners of his mouth suddenly lifted. "Evelyn?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you know her?" Brian was a little surprised. After all, Evelyn and Jason seemed to have nothing to do with each other.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sort of," Jason said in a meaningful tone. "If you care about this new girlfriend of yours, then don't let her make trouble. If she does, even you won't be able to protect her."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Did she offend you?" Brian&rsquo;s almond-shaped eyes rose slightly as he looked at Jason.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you think that she would still be able to stand there if she did?" Jason replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After this, Jason turned and left. At this moment, Evelyn happened to see Brian and quickly walked over.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Brian!" she called out his name.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she first entered the banquet hall, she saw a lot of public figures that she was used to only seeing on TV. There were even some A-list stars in the entertainment industry. For a small third-rate actor like her, this was something she could have barely dreamed of.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew that all of this was because of Brian Hart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You could have called me when you arrived. I'd pick you up at the entrance," Brian said. He raised his hand and helped Evelyn to tidy the strands of hair from her cheeks which were slightly messy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn could only feel that all this was like a dream. Who would have thought that she could be with this big shot in the entertainment industry?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was said that Brian was simply the Crown Prince of the entertainment industry. He could make anyone a star with a snap of his fingers.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for her, just as the production crew was in a state of dejection, she suddenly turned the tide because of Brian. Just because Brian Hart had taken a liking to her, almost everyone in the production crew treated her with respect. No one would dare to offend her again. Even the leading actor, director, and production staff had a very respectful attitude towards her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was a kind of feeling she had never felt before.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Women in their industry were rarely treated equally as men. It was very much an old boy&rsquo;s club.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">So this sense of power and acknowledgment was heady.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Didn't I come and find you by myself?" Evelyn smiled sweetly and held Brian's arm. "By the way, I saw a lot of first-rate celebrities today. I am so lucky. I've never had the chance to see so many big stars before. I don't know when I will become like them."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's not difficult. Later, I'll ask someone to arrange a TV series for you, and then I'll put you in several variety shows. At that point, you'll be able to pick any script you like," Brian said casually as if it was just a small matter.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Evelyn was stunned. She couldn't believe her ears. She had expended a lot of effort before, but she hadn't been able to get into a single variety show, let alone several!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then what's... my role?" she asked in bewilderment.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Of course you'd be the leading actress. You don't like that?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, I... I like it very much." Evelyn felt as if a wonderful opportunity had just fallen right into her lap. She was almost speechless.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Brian, why...why are you so good to me?" Evelyn whispered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian smiled faintly, his fingers gently caressing Evelyn's lips.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn's face suddenly flushed. Good heavens, there were still many people around!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But at this moment, she was reluctant to push his hand away.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Indeed, she knew if she were to do such a thing, to publicly embarrass this man in such a way, she could kiss all of her future opportunities goodbye.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Why am I so good to you? Because your lips are very beautiful, and I like them very much," he mumbled.</p></div>
