        <h1>Chapter 194</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Except he did not wait for her answer before saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hated someone before. Hated that person so very much. I thought hundreds, thousands of times about how if one day I were to find her, how I would take my revenge. I know I want to do it on her birthday. I still feel a little uncomfortable. It seems that my heart can be at peace only when I&rsquo;m here with you, Sis.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace kept her eyes shut, not speaking. She was pretending to be asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He actually hoped that she was asleep too. He did not actually want her to hear these words. This way, Grace&rsquo;s act was successful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Maybe I wish to see her again soon. This way, I can take my revenge, right? No matter where she&rsquo;s hiding, someday, I will find her and let her experience how being betrayed and tortured by a loved one is like.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice continued ringing faintly in the room, except his tone held hostility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s body involuntarily trembled slightly. A loved one&hellip; Could it be that the person he hated and wanted to take revenge on was his mother?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She still remembered he had once said that his mother left, abandoning him and his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If what he had said then was true&hellip; She was afraid that in the future, his mother&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, this emperor of Emerald City. Who could withstand his revenge?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace unconsciously thought of those three years she spent in jail&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Sis, in this lifetime, please don&rsquo;t ever become someone I hate, okay?&rdquo; When he said this, it sounded like the wind bellowing in the night. It was as if all the blood in her body had suddenly congealed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Actually&hellip; Did he know that she was awake?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One night passed just like this. When Grace got up at four in the morning to go to work, Jason was already out of the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This surprised her a little. When did he leave?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Still, it relieved her. At least she did not have to face him awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that pair of gloves she had not yet finished knitting, Grace once again felt that it was best to finish the gloves a little faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps when the gloves were completed, she could have nothing do with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sat in the back of the car, back against the seat. His eyes were closed, deep in thought. One of his hands gently rubbed his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pretty much did not get any sleep that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she had fallen asleep, he got up and watched her sleeping face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, he never thought that a person&rsquo;s sleeping face would be nice to look at, but when he was with her, it became an exception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like he would never get tired of looking at her sleeping face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Young Master Reed, are we returning to the house first?&rdquo; Terrence asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Mhm,&rdquo; Jason answered blandly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Except when the car was halfway there, Terrence&rsquo;s phone rang. After he answered the phone, his expression changed slightly. He immediately reported to Jason, &ldquo;Young Master, the master&rsquo;s illness has worsened. The doctors are performing a life-saving procedure now. Do you&hellip;. want to go to the hospital?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His black eyes opened wide in an instant, and Jason&rsquo;s thin lips spat out three words, &ldquo;To the hospital.&rdquo;</p></div>
