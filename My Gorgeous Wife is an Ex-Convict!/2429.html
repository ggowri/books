        <h1>Chapter 2427</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I'm... not in love with you. I'll be careful," she murmured as she looked down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers suddenly let go of her hand. "Then don't behave in ways that&rsquo;ll make me misunderstand." With that said, he put on his bathrobe again and got up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the moment he got up, there seemed to be a familiar pain spreading from his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he had felt the pain so many times... It was the pain he would feel whenever she said she did not love him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I've forgotten my affections for her. Why... am I feeling this pain again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The hands by the sides of his body clenched as Martin Weiss repeatedly asked himself. However, there was no answer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">William had told Jasper about many interesting places in Deer City, so much so that Jasper insisted on visiting them. Therefore, Grace and Jason took the three children to visit the scenic spots in Deer City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the three little ones, Grace thought her eldest son looked like a third wheel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Came to think of it, Jasper seemed to have a childhood sweetheart, which was William, while Mason had Veronica Barlow. Mick was the only one without a childhood sweetheart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's on your mind?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three children on the boat looked around curiously at the scenery of the lake. William introduced the scenery of the area almost like he was reciting from his textbook.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It made people wonder if he had memorized the guidebook.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was thinking it&rsquo;s lucky that Jasper met a childhood sweetheart like William. Children's feelings are the purest. I wonder when Mick will meet his childhood sweetheart," Grace said emotionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you wish for Mick to have a childhood sweetheart too?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course. Don't you think the notion of childhood sweethearts are sweet and desirable?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sweet? Desirable?" He raised his eyebrow. "Do you want a childhood sweetheart too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, when I was little..." Her voice paused suddenly. She felt the air pressure around them dropping, and his body was already moving closer to her. One hand was wrapped around her waist, almost trapping her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This position... was a little embarrassing. They had chartered the boat, but there were several bodyguards along with the three children! Besides, there was the boatman and other staff members. There were... many people around!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not jealous, are you? Little girls would always want childhood sweethearts who could protect them. It's just a fantasy. Besides, I didn&rsquo;t have one," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Doesn't Brian count?" Jason asked as his peach blossom eyes stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian?' Grace froze. Speaking of which, she and Brian met when they were kids, but... "It's not like we can be considered childhood sweethearts just because we met. Besides, I didn't even spend 24 hours with him when we were little."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lowered his head and caressed Grace's cheek as he said coldly, "Yeah, you didn't spend even a day together." However, the short time they spent together had trapped Brian forever. "If he hadn't lost contact with you, would you two have become childhood sweethearts?"</p></div>
