        <h1>Chapter 1899</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Terrence?" Jason raised his eyebrows slightly, "He told you? That's not what he's been telling me, but I&rsquo;ll only believe what I remember no matter what he said."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But what you remember isn't real!" Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So tell me, why didn't you or Terrence tell me if it's really as you said?" asked Jason as he stared at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's because we were scared that your brain wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle the shock if you recalled me falling into the sea! After all, these memories were repressed by hypnosis, and there was no knowing what might happen if you recalled them by force!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason slowly walked up to Grace. "So, you loved me so much that you would rather die with our three children in your belly than let me die?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace pressed her lips together tightly and nodded her head. His gaze was so piercing right now. It was as if he wanted to see through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyelashes quivered slightly as the corners of his lips twitched. "I told you the history of this room, didn't I?" he asked out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze, not understanding why he was suddenly asking this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did I also tell you that my great-grandfather even asked my great-grandmother whether she regretted it and whether she ever loved him after stabbing him with the sword? My great-grandmother left without a word while my great-grandfather used his last strength to make his death look like a suicide so that my great-grandmother wouldn't be involved in his death."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At this point, he touched her cheek gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His cold fingers made her tremble slightly, and the hair on her body instantly stood up. For some reason, she was enveloped by unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Look, what difference does it make how much you love someone? One could still go on with their life after killing someone, but the other tried their best to hide how they died as he could not let the public learn about the truth." He paused as his fingertips gently glided across her lips. "So the Reed family also calls it Room of Lies. Because this room is full of lies, and the only truth was the loss of a life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His fingers were so cold that even her lips seemed to freeze with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace wanted to open her mouth to say something. The uneasiness in her chest seemed to want to burst out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His thin lips opened and closed as his breath smelled like orchids. His cold voice enveloped her like the tenderest whisper, and it kept pouring into her ears, stinging her eardrums.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Don't! Don't go on!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She shouted in her heart, but she could hear him say, "Grace, you betrayed me so easily. How can I believe that you would sacrifice your own life and the lives of our children for me? Are you also trying to lie to me in this Room of Lies?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She stared blankly at him, her uneasy presentiment coming true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'He thinks what I said is a lie. Has he stopped believing whatever I say?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace knew that only by figuring out the problem with his memory could he truly believe her and maybe solve their problems.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He thought she fell into the sea to escape him! Therefore, he would not believe she loved him no matter what she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Furthermore, the fact she drugged him and forced her way onto the freeway with the car for Mrs. Watts was the truth.</p></div>
