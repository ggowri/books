        <h1>Chapter 3216</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper is the type of person who likes to speak his mind about everything, especially when it comes to things related to the piano. He can go on and on about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When you were playing, the transition here wasn't very smooth, and this part was slow..." Jasper pointed out Lawrence's mistakes by playing a few notes on the piano keys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence listened carefully, no one had ever pointed out things so clearly to him before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"However, as long as you practice more, it will be fine," said Jasper. "If you practice more, you will definitely be able to play your Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige even better in the future! Shall we play some other songs?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she finished speaking, she took the initiative to play a song and then grinned at Lawrence, continuing on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence hesitated for a moment and played another song instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, the two of them took turns playing, with Grace listening and Lawrence playing with the child. It was indeed very spiritual, but the downside was that it was still a bit inexperienced, with each song being almost the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grace said to Jason, 'Jasper seems to be very interested in him. If you keep playing, she might not let him go home today.'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This piece of music has been played for three hours since the two parties met until now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's just take the child back to the house for a little while," Jason said. After all, as long as his own daughter was having fun, that was all that mattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A little child like this suddenly being brought to an unfamiliar environment, it's natural for them to feel scared. And this child, from the looks of it, seems to be a bit timid to begin with," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Indeed, this child is a bit too obedient," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Jasper finished playing a song and waited for Lawrence to play another one. Lawrence hesitated and said, "I...I don't know how to play."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Jasper blinked his almond-shaped eyes, not understanding the meaning of this sentence at first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In response to her gaze, he became even more embarrassed. "I...I only know how to play these few pieces, I can't play anything else," he stuttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's eyes flashed disappointment, "So you only know these few songs." She wanted to hear him play more pieces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Abbott couple standing nearby saw this and were afraid that Jasper might lose interest in their son. They quickly said, "Lawrence, go back and learn a few more songs. You will definitely play more songs for Miss. Reed next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, which teacher are you learning piano from? Or are you taking lessons at an extracurricular piano coaching class?" Jasper asked curiously. "How often do you learn a new piece of music?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she asked this question, both the Abbott couple and Lawrence's faces immediately showed an embarrassed expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The scene suddenly fell silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Lawrence stuttered, "I... I haven't learned piano with a teacher before, and I haven't attended any tutoring classes either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked surprised, even Grace was a bit taken aback by it. She had heard the piano piece just now, but this child had never received formal training.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did you learn to play?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have a classmate who goes to tutoring classes, so I took a look at her music scores. There is a piano in the school's music room, and sometimes when no one is around, I secretly play it for a while," Lawrence whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace couldn't help but admire Lawrence's talent when she heard this. She feared that his talent was no less than Jasper's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If this child had a well-structured piano learning system, they could definitely play better!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper thought for a moment and said, "Would you like to learn piano with me in the future? My teacher would definitely like you and would be happy to teach you. Then we can play the piano together often."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The more she spoke, the more excited she became.</p></div>
