        <h1>Chapter 2618</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Camille Strickland came to Valda Theller's studio the next day, she could not help taunting, "You must&rsquo;ve been pranked!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she heard about what happened in the restaurant from her best friend, the first thing that came to her mind was that her best friend had met a fraudster!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He doesn't look much like a fraudster," Valda Theller explained in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland said, "Do fraudsters have the word 'fraud' engraved on their faces? He would have at least told you his contact information if he was serious. You don't even have his contact information right now. Tell me, how are you going to date each other?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Well, Valda Theller could not argue about this point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was that man only pranking me? But I somehow think his tone and eyes at the time were serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But... I have no idea if we'll ever see each other again if I don't have his contact information.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, why did you agree to date him?" Camille Strickland asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's probably... because he has good looks," Valda Theller said a little guiltily. However, there were other reasons too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was this sense of dead silence about the man. It was as if he would fall into the abyss if someone did not help him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the same too. She still remembered the feeling of falling into an abyss when she realized that her feelings were just a game to someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Camille had not helped her, perhaps her life would have turned out differently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But if that guy is only pranking me, maybe he doesn't have to find a girlfriend to solve his problems. That would be good too," Valda Theller said after breathing a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't be naive. If that man is as good-looking as you said, would he have trouble finding a girlfriend? You're just too gullible that that bastard Raymond Bowman..." Camille Strickland suddenly stopped talking as an apologetic look appeared on her face. "I'm sorry. I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you apologizing? You're right. Raymond Bowman is indeed a bastard." Valda Theller faked a relaxed smile before raising her hands to hug her best friend. "Camille, thank you for helping me and stopping me from giving up on myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you talking about? Alright, accompany me to the blind date tonight. Maybe the friend he brought is a nice man!" Camille Strickland said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, Camille Strickland took Valda Theller to the restaurant where she had agreed to meet her date. However, Valda Theller's expression instantly changed when they reached the dining table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were already two men sitting on one side of the dining table. One of them was wearing a white shirt. This man with the handsome face was once a prince to many women!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller did not expect to meet him here. Camille Strickland was also dumbfounded as she exclaimed, "Raymond Bowman, what are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh, do you know each other?" Keith Sharp, Camille Strickland's blind date today, asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, we do. We studied in the same university but were in different courses," answered Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What coincidence. Here, have a seat. You can order anything you want." Keith Sharp warmly asked them to sit down. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller knew Camille had a good impression of her blind date. The two had been chatting online for almost two weeks, and it was only now that they were meeting for the first time.</p></div>
