        <h1>Chapter 2123</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Whether you can help or not, I want you to try. You don't want anything to happen to Kyla either, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What?" Grace was taken aback. "What's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss told Grace about the hospital's diagnosis and said, "You're her friend. Whatever I say doesn't work on her, but maybe she'll listen to you. Please advise her to give up the baby. If her body can't take it in the third trimester..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could hardly imagine it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's face became serious at this. She pondered for a moment and said, "Okay, I'll find time to persuade Kyla, but I can't guarantee that I'll succeed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"As long as you&rsquo;ll try to persuade her!" Martin Weiss said gratefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace told Jason about it at night. "I'm planning to go look for Kyla tomorrow to talk about this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you going to persuade her to give up the baby?" asked Jason. He was able to understand what Martin Weiss was feeling. It was just like when Grace was pregnant with the triplets and the doctor said that it was necessary to have a pregnancy reduction to keep the mother and babies safe. However, Grace still insisted on not having the pregnancy reduction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They even argued over it for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I hope Kyla will be safe, but I also understand how hard it is for a mother to give up her children," said Grace, who also narrowly escaped death to give birth to the triplets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason murmured, "But have you ever thought about what will happen to the man who loves you if you give up your own life to keep your children? Just like how you would risk your life for the children, I would risk their lives for yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace blinked her eyes as if she was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Do you think I'm not a good father?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Not... really. I know it's because you love me very much, but..." She hesitated and said sternly, "If the children and I are ever in danger, I'd still want you to save the children."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As a mother, she was willing to sacrifice herself, including her life, for her children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stared at her quietly, his eyes glimmering slightly. Then, he said slowly, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That one word was worth a thousand words. If that ever happened, he would save the children as she wanted, and then he would die with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would live if she lived; if she died, he would die too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace seemed to understand the meaning behind Jason's answer instantly. Her eyes were instantly covered with tears. "You..." She sobbed, unable to speak. Was she going to call him foolish, stupid, or stubborn? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it was only because he loved her so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He loved her the most in the world!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, thank you for loving me so much," she said as she stood on tiptoes and kissed him on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He responded to her kiss.</p></div>
