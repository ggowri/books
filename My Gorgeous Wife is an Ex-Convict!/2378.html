        <h1>Chapter 2376</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's true, but there are so many mental hospitals in the country. If we look into them one by one..." Kyla said in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it possible? How could a woman like Amber Mitchell be in a mental hospital? Has Amber Mitchell... gone insane?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "We'll search the ones in Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s city before the nearby cities. If we have her name and photo, it&rsquo;ll be easier for us as long as her identity isn&rsquo;t concealed. We should start searching first. If we still can't find her, we'll find a way to get Jacqueline Bowman to tell us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, thank you!" Kyla said gratefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it had not been for her best friend, all her efforts would be futile. She would have let Jacqueline Bowman be released on probation and flee abroad with the money without getting any information on Amber Mitchell's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, judging from the fake address Jacqueline Bowman texted her, she had no intention of telling her Amber Mitchell's whereabouts in the first place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can thank me when we find Amber Mitchell," said Grace. She pulled Kyla into the car and sent Kyla back to the apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was in the apartment. When he saw Kyla return, he asked, "How was it? Did Jacqueline Bowman say anything about Amber Mitchell's whereabouts?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "In a moment of desperation, Jacqueline Bowman said Amber Mitchell is in a mental hospital. I&rsquo;ll search all the patients in mental hospitals nationwide to see if I can find Amber Mitchell. Please take care of Kyla. Her health&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know. I'll take care of her, " said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then left with Jason. Martin Weiss looked at the distracted Kyla and said, "Alright, it's late. Wash up and go to bed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Kyla muttered and headed toward the bathroom. However, she hung her head low as she walked. She seemed to be deep in thought. She did not notice the door in front of her until she heard hurried footsteps. She came to her senses when she bumped into a wide embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you look ahead when you walk? Do you realize you almost ran into the door?" Martin Weiss's frustrated voice rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked up as she murmured, "I'm sorry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "I'm not the one you should apologize to. Think of yourself and the baby you&rsquo;re carrying! It's a good thing you're at home. What if you had run into an oncoming car walking like that?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll pay attention next time," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together, pulled her into the bathroom, and said, "Stay here and don't move. I'll go get your clothes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He went to the closet, took her clothes, and put them in the bathroom. After turning on the heater, he said, "Alright, take your shower. I'll wait outside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once the bathroom door was closed, Kyla looked at herself in the mirror. Her face was pale, her brows were furrowed, and her eyes were full of worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was right to scold her. If she walked around so absent-mindedly again, the baby in her belly would suffer! However, she could not control herself from entertaining foolish ideas.</p></div>
