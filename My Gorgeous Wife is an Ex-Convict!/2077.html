        <h1>Chapter 2075</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew that Chase Harper's main income now came from his shop. If he lost his shop, he and his daughter would suffer greatly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's okay if she wants to come here and make a scene again, but don't give in too much to her. If you give in once, there&rsquo;ll be many more times in the future. You'll be left with no choice in the end!" Kyla warned him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper said, "Okay, I got it. Let me know if she bothers you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Their concern for each other stung Martin Weiss's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper then turned to Martin Weiss and said, "Mr. Weiss, thank you for just now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You&rsquo;re thanking me?" Martin Weiss sneered. "I'm just helping Kyla out. You don't need to thank me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; made it sound like they were together, while he was just an outsider!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase Harper was instantly embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked at Martin Weiss. "Why did you come?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Would you believe me if I said I came over because I missed you and Nelson?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mr. Weiss, I think I've made it clear to you that you're only troubling me by behaving like this," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Trouble?" Martin Weiss smiled mockingly as he pointed to Chase Harper and said, "If I'm troubling you, what about him? Isn&rsquo;t he troubling you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He's my friend! Leave him out of this!" said Kyla as she stood between Chase Harper and Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, what she did seem to trigger him even more. Martin Weiss's face darkened as he said, "What if I have to involve him? What's so good about this guy? What about him is worth defending? What can he give you that I can't?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could not help uttering these words as if jealousy had crumbled all his composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, I won't forgive you if you lay a hand on Chase! I will never forgive you!" Kyla glared at him as she spoke with utter determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss stiffened as he looked at Kyla with determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She said something like that for Chase Harper&hellip; 'Does that mean...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is this man that important to you?" he murmured while his face was ghastly pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, he's my friend. Of course, he's important to me!" said Kyla. She met Martin Weiss's eyes without the slightest fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was only afraid that she would trouble Chase and that Martin Weiss would do something to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Chase had helped her so much. She did not want something bad to happen to Chase because of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really?" Martin Weiss suddenly smiled. His eyes seemed foggy as he looked at Kyla. "If I do something to Chase Harper, how exactly are you not going to forgive me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss!" shouted Kyla. The coldness and hatred in her eyes drained the color from his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">How long had she not looked at him with such hatred?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was all because of Chase Harper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss hardly had the strength to continue standing. He dared not even glance at Kyla as he was scared to see the hatred in her eyes again.</p></div>
