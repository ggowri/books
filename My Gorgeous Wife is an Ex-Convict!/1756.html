        <h1>Chapter 1754</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it was possible that Lily was the mastermind. Grace panicked! She was afraid that when she saw her child again, he would already be a cold corpse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't worry." Jason hugged Grace tightly. "Our child isn't that vulnerable! Besides, Secretary Wang said he had trained and taught Mason a lot of skills. It's unlikely that the little guy will let Lily have her way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was momentarily stunned. Jason then told her what Secretary Wang said about Mason's childhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace started sobbing, and tears welled up in her eyes as she listened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'My child suffered all these at such an early age! He's the same age as... Jasper, but while Jasper was sleeping in my arms, Mason was engaged in all kinds of fights. He probably even fought with fierce dogs just to become an heir fit for the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But Mason's just a child! A child who couldn&rsquo;t even speak fluently!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How... How could Secretary Wang do that? Why... Why did Mason have to suffer like that?" Grace could hardly hear the rest of it. She hated Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it was a fact that Mason had gone through all these experiences. She wanted to finish listening no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her hands were clenched into fists as if she were trying her best to suppress her nerves, or she would have a breakdown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason finally loosened Grace's hands and stopped her from clenching them. "Your hands are still injured. It&rsquo;ll only hurt more if you clench your fists so hard."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But Mason... has suffered from more injuries," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll bring Mason back to the Reed family, but you can't ignore the condition of your hands. You almost hurt your hands to protect the little girl today," said Jason as he gently stroked her palms where her nails had pressed into.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That child has always protected Mason. She has Mason's best interest at heart. How could I not protect her?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even if you wanted to protect her, you should&rsquo;ve paid more attention to your own safety. Do you know how much you mean to me?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pulled Grace into his arms again. "Grace, I love you. You mean more to me than anything!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could sacrifice anyone and anything but her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was his everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There had been no further messages or calls from the kidnappers. It was as if they were giving them enough time to prepare the money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although the Reed family did not report it to the police as per the kidnappers' requirement, various relevant experts had secretly entered the residence. They started various preparations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace also told Mick Reed and Jasper to stay home and take a leave of absence from the kindergarten for a few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now that Mason had been kidnapped, she feared that something might happen to her other two children as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two little ones seemed to feel the depressing atmosphere in the residence. They had also learned that their brother had been kidnapped.</p></div>
