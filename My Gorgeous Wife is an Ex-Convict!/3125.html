        <h1>Chapter 3123</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After talking to Amber, she suddenly had a strong desire to meet Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Halfway through, Valda called Brian on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, Brian. I'm on my way to your company right now. I just passed Coming Bridge, so I should be there in a little while. Let's have lunch together at noon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she was speaking, suddenly she felt a jolt and with a scream, her phone slipped from her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, the driver slammed on the brakes and the car came to a stop. Nervously, the driver turned his head and asked, "Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda finally managed to steady herself and took a deep breath, saying, "I'm okay now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait a moment, I need to go down and deal with something," said the driver. "We were just rear-ended!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda just realized that there was a minor car accident earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, there wasn't a terrible car accident. She still felt a bit shaken from the impact earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda quickly bent down and searched for her phone inside the car. After a while, she found it in the gap between the seats. However, the phone was now blacked out and she couldn't turn it on immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda frowned, afraid that she would have to find a place to repair her phone today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking outside, the taxi driver is still arguing with the other driver, but both have already called the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda got out of the car and the driver said to her, "Why don't you switch to another car? The other party is not willing to settle this privately, we have to wait for the police to come and handle it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda nodded in agreement upon hearing this, but she knew that this was not a place where they could stop the car. They would have to walk a few steps further until they reached a spot where the taxi could pull over and park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda limped slowly, dragging one leg, towards the side of the road and continued walking forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her pace quickened, faster than usual. The call had just ended like that, would Brian be worried? She wanted to see Brian as soon as possible and tell him that she was okay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And besides, she also wanted to tell him... tell him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she finally arrived at the temporary taxi stand, she realized that she had broken out in a sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked around at the passing vehicles, hoping to quickly spot an empty taxi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she was searching for a taxi, suddenly a familiar car drove up and stopped on the opposite side of the road.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's... Brian's car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was surprised, Brian came?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she was thinking, she saw Brian quickly getting out of the car. His phoenix-like eyes were staring straight at her as he walked across the street and hurriedly ran towards her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There...there's no crosswalk here at all! Watching him weave through the oncoming traffic, Valda felt her heart race with fear that he might get hurt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, when he ran up to her, he hugged her tightly and exclaimed, "Valda!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This embrace, with intense trembling, but she couldn't tell, whether it was him trembling or her trembling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened on the phone just now? Are you okay? Is everything alright?" He let go of his embrace and looked at her anxiously, checking her condition from head to toe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyes became moist, looking at the man in front of her. His face was pale, and his hand holding her wrist was trembling, but he was also being very careful. His phoenix-like eyes were filled with nervousness as he looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How worried is he about her, exactly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She arrived here so quickly, just after ending a phone call!</p></div>
