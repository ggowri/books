        <h1>Chapter 3873</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was vomiting in the toilet, and she vomited for a while until her stomach was empty before she felt a little better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she walked out of the toilet compartment, Shirley quickly approached and asked, "How are you? Why did you vomit for so long?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My stomach just felt uncomfortable, and I suddenly felt nauseous and wanted to vomit," Veronica said, looking at her friend's worried eyes. She smiled and said, "I'm fine now. It feels much better after vomiting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She walked to the sink, rinsed her mouth, and washed her face with cold water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when she looked at herself in the mirror on the sink, she looked pale, especially because she had been splashed with vegetable soup before. Her hair and clothes were covered in vegetable soup, making her look particularly embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you really okay?" Shirley asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then go to my dormitory first, take a shower, and change your clothes! Our body shapes are similar, so you can wear my clothes too," Shirley said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was a day student, so she did not live in the school dormitory, making Shirley's proposal the most convenient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let's go to your dormitory first," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they arrived at Shirley's dormitory, Shirley gave Veronica some clean clothes to change into.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The dorm room has a private bathroom, so taking a shower is quite convenient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, before taking a shower, Veronica vomited again after smelling the dried fish Shirley had taken out casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But since she had already vomited before, there wasn't much left in her stomach, so she didn't vomit much this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Veronica finished washing her hair and body and came out of the bathroom, Shirley suddenly asked her, "Veronica, have you had sex with Mason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica stumbled and almost slipped. Shirley's question was really embarrassing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then Shirley realized that her question was inappropriate and quickly changed it, "I...I mean, are you pregnant? Did you have your period this month?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was stunned. Her period was already a week late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, her period had been early or late by a week before, which was within the normal range.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You just vomited earlier, which feels a bit like morning sickness. If your period is late, why don't you go to the hospital for a check-up, just in case!" Shirley suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Half an hour later, Veronica and Shirley arrived at the hospital and got a number for the gynecology department.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It didn't take long for Veronica to see the doctor, who gave her a prescription for a blood test, which is the most accurate way to determine if she is pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Veronica had her blood drawn, she sat in the waiting area, waiting for the test results, while Shirley went to the hospital's convenience store to buy some food for Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Veronica had vomited most of the food she had eaten before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Veronica's phone rang, and she saw that it was Mason calling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She answered and heard Mason say, "I'll come pick you up later. You don't have class this afternoon, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait!" Veronica quickly said, "I'm not at school right now, don't go to school."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where are you?" he asked.</p></div>
