        <h1>Chapter 266</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Grace did know some big shot, why would she work as a sweeper at the Sanitation Service Center and even become an extra for money?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No... Nothing, it's all over now," Grace said vaguely. "Claire, I think I might not be suitable as an extra. I won't do this anymore. Please tell Sidney that I apologize for the trouble. I'll quit the group chat later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, a lot of people had witnessed the scene yesterday. The entertainment industry was so small, and everyone met frequently. If she became an extra again, she would feel awkward. She might as well just stop right here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was a pity that she could no longer use this method to earn extra money. As for now, she could only think of other ways to increase her income.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I see." Claire could see that Grace did not want to talk about what had happened yesterday, so she did not ask any more questions. She only said, "I'll talk to Sidney later, but you'd better give Sidney a heads up before you quit the group chat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Will do," Grace replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, she was more worried about making extra money. After all, she wanted to pay Lina back as soon as she could, and if her grandmother's medical expenses increased again in the future, it would be very difficult for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the thought of this, she could not help but smile bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the past, she only thought that by studying well, she could definitely earn lots of money in the future. However, she was now doing manual labor for money. All the knowledge she gained so many years before and even the laws she memorized were of no use to her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She did not know if this was considered as irony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After getting off work, Grace went to a stall near the Sanitation Service Center for a simple packed lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The lunch box was certainly not as good as the dinner prepared by the chef at Reed Residence, but she ate without any burden or constraint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was unlike when she ate with Jason at Reed Residence. She always seemed to be bound by something. A heavy sense of oppression often made her feel like running away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In conclusion, she could not see through this man. Even if he said that he could be her Jay, she did not know what was the truth and what was a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was also possible that what happened to her in prison previously had made her fear him. She&hellip; was afraid of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She feared that she might accidentally annoy him, and he would make her go through that hell again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Shaking her head, Grace stopped herself from thinking more of it. After eating the food in her hands in a hurry, she took the bus and went back to her family&rsquo;s home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, it was no longer her home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace rang the doorbell, and a moment later, it was Evelyn who opened the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"There you are, Sis." Evelyn looked like a gentle lady, not at all as domineering as when they first met on set.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace glanced lightly at her and entered the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Melinda Riley greeted her warmly. "Here comes Grace. Your dad and I were just talking about you."</p></div>
