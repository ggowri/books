        <h1>Chapter 2116</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll have someone else take them," he said. He had already taken off his shirt, and the look in his eyes was all the more captivating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could not help gulping. "But... But I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you sure you don't want it?" He bent over, and his beautiful face magnified in front of her while his warm breath sprinkled onto her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just like everyone, she could not control herself in front of a beauty. She eventually surrendered to his good looks. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It seemed that she could not resist him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace put her hands around Jason's neck and kissed his lips to show that she wanted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Martin Weiss woke up the next day, Grace said to him, "I don't care what will happen to you and Kyla in the future, but I won't spare you if you hurt Kyla."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss looked at her indifferently. "If that ever happens one day, you won't have to do anything. I won't spare myself either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss turned to leave but suddenly stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He asked, "Grace, why do you want to be with Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What?" She paused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jason was involved in your imprisonment, so why did you choose to be with him?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Not many people knew Jason had looked on coolly back then, but Martin Weiss had looked into the matter after Grace fell into the sea. He accidentally found out about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace stared at Martin Weiss. After a moment, she said, "Because I know no one in the world loves me more than him. If I lose him, I&rsquo;ll regret it for the rest of my life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss smiled sadly. "I see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Maybe... Kyla never believed that I&rsquo;m the one who loves her the most.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because he had hurt her deeply in the past. Even all the promises he made back when they were dating had become lies in her mind. It was why Kyla could no longer trust him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A few days later, Martin Weiss and Kyla went to the Family Planning Commission to get the birth permission certificate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The staff gave Kyla a form, and she filled out the information as required. Then, she and Martin Weiss handed their marriage license, ID, and household registration book to the staff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once that was done, they sat on chairs and waited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss looked at the silent Kyla and said, "I've explained the details of our marriage to my mother. She won't bother you again. If she has said something that upset you, please don't take it personally."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Your mother didn't say anything that upset me. Now that she knows everything&hellip; That&rsquo;s great," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really..." Martin Weiss was a little sad. She had always spoken to him in such a flat tone. It was as if he meant nothing to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Thinking of his conversation with Grace the next morning after getting drunk at the Reed family&rsquo;s house, he suddenly asked, "Kyla, how much do you trust me now?"</p></div>
