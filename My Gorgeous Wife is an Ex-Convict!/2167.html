        <h1>Chapter 2165</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, I didn't. I didn't push anyone!" he shouted as his tiny body curled up to protect his hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His hands mattered the most to him. He wanted to use them to play beautiful songs on the piano. That was what&hellip; Jasper loved most. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">By the time the adults noticed this and pulled the children away, William was already badly beaten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William was limping toward his room when he met Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at the way William looked, Jasper was surprised and subconsciously asked in concern, "What happened to you? Who hit you?" However, as soon as she spoke, she remembered that they were still in the midst of a cold war. She immediately shut her mouth again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked at Jasper and mumbled, "Do you... Do you want to practice playing the piano? I... I can play it now." It was all he was good at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, he did a good job of protecting his hands, so his hands were not hurt. He could play those complicated pieces!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper Reed's eyebrows furrowed. She did not like seeing him all bruised. 'He's still insistent on playing the piano. Doesn't he know how badly bruised he is? Doesn't he feel any pain?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William walked toward Jasper step by step. "I... I can play the piano. I... I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of new pieces. Why... Why don't I play the piano for you? Jasper... Don't hate me. Don't ignore me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper stared blankly at the person approaching her and was a little shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she heard him say, "I didn't push Nelson Corbyn down the stairs. I didn't lie..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She instantly came to her senses and was mad again. "You still won't admit it? I hate liars. I never want to play the piano with you again!" With that said, Jasper turned her head and ran away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's eyes filled with despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stared blankly at the hands he had tried so hard to protect. Even the only advantage he had was no longer useful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She used to love playing the piano with him, but she no longer wanted to do that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If the only thing he had was no longer useful, then... what did he have left?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Maybe he had nothing left!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace lost her temper when she came back and saw William's bruised face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said to Uncle Kwan, "Remind everyone in the house that bullying isn't allowed in the Reed family&rsquo;s house. If I find out about this again, they can leave the Reed family. This applies to everyone! If Jasper and Mick are the ones bullying others, I&rsquo;ll punish them too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," said Uncle Kwan, knowing that it was time to give the servants a good lecturing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, the servants' children were the ones who bullied William, but it had something to do with the servants' usual behavior too. Uncle Kwan knew that some children would tell their parents after they bullied William and their parents would praise them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at William again. "Let me know if someone bullies you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked blankly at the person in front of him. She... was different from his mother.</p></div>
