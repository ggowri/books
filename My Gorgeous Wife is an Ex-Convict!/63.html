        <h1>Chapter 62</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean continued to repeat in his mind the scene he&rsquo;d encountered at the apartment. Jason's attitude toward Grace... could only be described as "gentle".</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But that didn&rsquo;t make sense.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Reed was not&hellip; gentle.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man was all ice.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason Reed had never been gentle to a woman. Not even Jennifer Atkinson, his fiancee, had been treated with such reverence. Sean recalled the cold interactions between the couple, and even Lily mentioned that their marriage was one of convenience, and for business.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, the matter of the engagement advertisement being taken down flashed across Sean's mind. Previously, they had always thought that it was because of Grace. They thought that Jason hated the Stevens Family because of her and did not like seeing the Stevens Family proposing in such a high-profile way.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But thinking about it, it was indeed because of Grace. However, the motive behind the action was completely different from what they had originally thought it was!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the apartment, Grace was having a meal with Jason. It was the quiet time of the day that they looked forward to. The point where they ate and chatted and spent time together before they would go to sleep. Grace also told him about what had happened at the Sanitation Service Center. "I don't know why, but the director actually fired Farah for picking on me. I thought I would be the one getting dismissed."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Isn't that good?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace said with some hesitation, "Of course, I'm okay with it since I've not been fired, but I don't know if Farah will take revenge on me." After all, Farrah had been about to hit her, before Chase interceded.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"She can't do anything," Jason said. As for Farah Steele, he would naturally help Grace solve any lurking issues. The thing on his mind was that someone was hiding in the dark outside. Although he had not seen the person's appearance clearly, if he had guessed correctly, it was probably Sean.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Last night at the intersection, Sean must have seen that he was with Grace, so he had come to seek confirmation.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you like living with me like this?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace did not hesitate as she replied, "Of course I do."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then even if I were to change my identity in the future, would you still be willing to live with me?" he asked, staring at her with his deep eyes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She blinked in confusion. To change his identity...was he referring to someone other than a homeless person? Her friend Lina had always said that she knew too little about him and was afraid that she would be taken advantage of.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for her, she had never asked him about his identity. In fact, she only knew the name 'Jay'. Other than that, she only knew that he did not have any family members.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina said that he didn't seem like a homeless man. Sometimes, Grace also felt the same way.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But if he didn't want to tell her, she wouldn't take the initiative to ask. After all, every one had his or her own secrets.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'd be willing to," she said gently.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No matter what kind of status I have, will you be willing to accept me?" he asked again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason&rsquo;s gaze was intense.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had supported her, protected her, defended her. Even knowing about her past.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Would she judge him or accept him? There was no question for her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, no matter what, okay?" She smiled and said, "Eat quickly or else the food will go cold."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He also smiled, his lips rising in a crooked smile that was a little smug.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was in a trance and felt that his smile was too beautiful and that no other smile could beat it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She turned back to her food and pushed the thoughts away.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her &lsquo;brother&rsquo; might be hot, but as his &lsquo;sister,&rsquo; she&rsquo;d be wise not to think of him in that way.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">***</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Babe, what do you think?" In the dress store, Lily was wearing a high-end gown tailor-made for her. This gown had been specially made for the engagement banquet and it had cost half a million.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Could he see the point in spending so much on a few bits of cloth and beads? No. But she could and her family did, and like everything that marked the start of their relationship, it was about appearances.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And sparing no expense illustrated how committed the Atkinsons were to this engagement.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean looked at the noble and beautiful woman in front of him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Everyone envied him for having such a girlfriend. She was a popular television star and the daughter of the Atkinson family. After the death of Jennifer Atkinson, Lily had become the only heir.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Marrying Lily was equivalent to getting into the Atkinson family.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You look beautiful, Lily,&rdquo; Sean told her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was very satisfied with himself, and he even looked forward to the engagement party.</p></div>
