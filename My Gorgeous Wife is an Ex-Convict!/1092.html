        <h1>Chapter 1091</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can I leave the mansion?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled, but the smile seemed weak because of his fever. "No, you can't leave without my consent!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Come on, is this the time to say that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you have any medicine? Your temperature isn't low. You need to quickly take some medicine!" she said. She reckoned he got the fever from being caught in the rain last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," he replied lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where's your phone? Contact your secretary Terrence and ask him to take you to the hospital," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned and said, "I don't need to go to the hospital. It's just a fever. I'll be alright in a couple of days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if you don't go to the hospital, at least you can get Terrence to buy some fever-reducing medicine," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pursed his thin lips and said nothing but pushed the covers off him to get out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not afraid of taking medicine, are you?" she asked casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he stiffened and looked at her uneasily. His already flushed face seemed to grow a little redder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No way, is he scared of taking medicine?' Grace was shocked, but she seemed to have bought medicine for his stomach before. He was not afraid back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you love me, then?" he asked out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned, not knowing why he asked this so suddenly, but she replied, "No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes dimmed a little, and he smirked sarcastically. "Why do you seem to care a lot about me if you don't love me? Isn't it great for you that I&rsquo;m having a fever?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It would be better if you would let me go," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gritted his teeth and glared at her with those beautiful peach-blossom eyes. "Don't even think of leaving this place without falling in love with me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt that Jason was just like a stubborn child who was throwing a tantrum.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because of the fever?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that Jason was about to walk toward the bathroom, Grace suddenly came forward and grabbed his arm. "Do you know&hellip;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This strength of hers would have stopped him, but she made him totter and he fell toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was caught off guard and fell backward under Jason's pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Subconsciously, she closed her eyes and waited for the pain of landing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thump! A loud sound and a muffled groan rang in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only it was not the sound of her body falling to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not the hard floor beneath her but&hellip; a warm body!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately opened her eyes only to see Jason lying underneath her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did he just flip me around on the way down and saved me from hitting the ground?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it hurt?" His eyelashes fluttered, and his black eyes looked at her nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly had an indescribable feeling. She should have been the one to ask him if he was in pain, but it was the other way around.</p></div>
