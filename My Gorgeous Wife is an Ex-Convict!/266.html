        <h1>Chapter 265</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as she turned around, she noticed Jason leaning against the door. His eyes were fixed on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Who called you?" he asked as he approached her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"My father," Grace answered. "I'm going to go home tomorrow night, so can you ask the driver not to pick me up at the Sanitation Service Center?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His eyes glistened thoughtfully. "Do you want me to go back with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked at him in surprise. Go back with her? Why would he go back with her? Besides, she was going back to deal with her mother's affairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, I can go back by myself," Grace said. "It's late. I'm going to bed now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In other words, she was asking him to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He narrowed his eyes slightly, bent down, and picked up a strand of her long hair with his fingers. "Why are you so against me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She pressed her lips together and gave no answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then tell me what I must do so that you'll treat me like you used to." His breath was fragrant like an orchid, and it sprinkled on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wanted her to smile lovingly at him and speak gently to him as she had done before. Her eyes used to be full of him as if they were mutually dependent on each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Like she used to?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was shocked. "You used to be Jay," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I can be Jay too. I can be Jay just for you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her heart gave a sudden jerk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Be Jay just for her? Was that possible?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She should be afraid of him, but why was her heart beating so fast when she heard those words?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He slowly lowered his head, his forehead against hers, "I've only said these words to you alone. Will you consider me as Jay again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace barely slept all night as Jason's words kept echoing in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Be Jay again just for her? His expression was so serious that it made her feel like he was not playing around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, Sidney is asking me about you. He asked who you are and whether you work in the Sanitation Service Center. He said you had a quite a show yesterday and have some big shot backing you. What happened?" Claire asked Grace as soon as she reached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Sidney she mentioned was the organizer of the group of extras.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Since Grace was recommended by Claire, it was natural for Sidney to ask her about it. Claire was completely at a loss when she listened to Sidney talk about what had happened on the set the other day.</p></div>
