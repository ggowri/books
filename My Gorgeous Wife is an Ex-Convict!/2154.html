        <h1>Chapter 2152</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ah!" She opened her eyes suddenly as she sat up. Then, she realized that she had a nightmare!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the dream, she experienced the moment when Martin Weiss took her to the operating room. However, Martin Weiss did not stop the operation but insisted on making her go through with it. The anesthesia needle went into her body. She wanted to struggle and escape, but her body could not move no matter what...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately... it was just a dream!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla gasped and looked at her son sleeping next to her. Nelson was still sleeping soundly, undisturbed by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She got up and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water, only to see Martin Weiss still leaning against the car from the kitchen window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His posture was the same as earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, hours had passed since then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla held the cup tightly in her hand. After a long time, she finally put it down and walked toward the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she opened the door, Martin Weiss seemed to hear her as he suddenly raised his head and looked toward the door. The next moment, he caught sight of her figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes somehow heated up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He thought she would not look his way again even if she saw him standing outside, but she came out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla walked toward Martin Weiss step by step but stopped when she was three steps away from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss took a step forward, and Kyla took one step backward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't move. Just keep it at this distance!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Gloom flashed across Martin Weiss's eyes. He stopped moving. "Okay, I won't move!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What are you doing standing here in the middle of the night?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss muttered, "I... I didn't know where to go. I ended up here without knowing it. I did a lot of thinking as I stood here. Maybe you're right. All this time, I've only been thinking about my feelings and not yours. I domineeringly decided everything without thinking about how much this decision would hurt you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked at her with pleading eyes. "Kyla, will you forgive me? I know how ridiculous it is for me to ask you for forgiveness right now, but I just... I just love you too much to lose you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even the mere thought of it made him tremble with fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla bit her lip. After a long time, she said, "Martin Weiss, I don&rsquo;t think we're suitable for each other. It's the same as before. You didn&rsquo;t force me to get the abortion in the end, so I can forgive you since you want me to. But I hope we'll stop getting involved with each other from now on. I don't want to... see you unless necessary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss felt as if he had been punched hard in his heart. It hurt so much. "Do you hate me that much? Even meeting..." He tried to move toward her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she backed away as soon as he approached her. "Don't come over, Martin Weiss. I really don't want to see you. You know what? I just had another nightmare. I dreamed about what happened today. I dreamed about being pressed down on the operating table and being forced to undergo an operation. You're not me, and you'll never know how terrifying it is!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His face was gloomy as he looked at the distance between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They were only three steps away from each other, but it seemed like a chasm. It was a distance he could never cross.</p></div>
