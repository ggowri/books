        <h1>Chapter 622</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not take a chance. She could not afford to lose Nelson. Nelson had become the motivation for her to live!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that she had no way of getting in on this, so she could only say, "You can always let me know if you need my help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you!" Kyla said with a smile, "In fact, you've helped me a lot. If it weren't for you, Nelson might not be able to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a figure suddenly broke into the restaurant, interrupting Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian ran in, panting. Under Kyla and Grace&rsquo;s surprised eyes, he grabbed Grace by the arm and asked urgently, "Are you marrying Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. It had not been made public yet. She only mentioned it to Lina and Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she gave an affirmative answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because I love him and he loves me. Isn't it a matter of course for us to get married?" She looked at him calmly and said, "Please let go, Mr. Hart!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, it was evening and almost closing time, so there were only a few customers in the shop. Otherwise, it might cause a stir again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You love him?" Brian felt like he was being stabbed in his heart with a sharp sword. The pain almost suffocated him. "You clearly said you'd like to be with me forever!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned. She looked at Brian with a puzzled expression. "I've never said anything like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You did say that! You said you thought you were dispensable and I said you weren't. I told you you&rsquo;re important to me, then you said if only we could be together forever!" he answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He repeated what they had said to each other back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the first time he had ever said these words to another person. Before that, he had never felt that anyone was important to him, not even his parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After hearing what he told her many years ago, she smiled. Her smile was so beautiful that it was engraved into his mind for years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she said that she hoped they could be together forever, his first thought was that his days would not be boring if he had her with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to see her smile every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this current moment, Grace frowned even more. 'Dispensable&hellip;' There had been a time during her childhood when she felt that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was when her father married her stepmother. After they had Evelyn, he left her with her grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although her grandmother was very kind to her, others saw her as a nuisance. Children were always sensitive to the looks from adults.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were even moments when she wondered if it would be better if she had gone to heaven with her mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not remember telling Brian all this! Therefore, it was just a coincidence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As I said, you've mistaken me for someone else, Mr. Hart," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;m not mistaking you for someone else! Grace, don't marry Jason, all right? I don't know why you won't admit ever meeting me back then. Is it because of Jason? Or did you really forget? I've been looking for you for so many years. There hasn't been a day since we parted that I didn't miss you..." Brian insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he raised his hand to touch her face. He wanted to tell her how much he missed her and how much he regretted letting go of her hand in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she immediately turned her face away, letting his hand fall.</p></div>
