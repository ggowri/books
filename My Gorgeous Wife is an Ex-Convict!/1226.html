        <h1>Chapter 1225</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'After all, it's Jason's marriage registration! Few people in Emerald City probably knew that Master Reed was registering his marriage here! If Emerald City's media learned about this, it would cause a stir in the whole city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... the woman who's marrying Jason is a stranger. She's not an heiress in Emerald City, is she? In particular, the sight of her fingers when she&rsquo;s signing the papers. She writes a little slower than ordinary people, and the knuckles of her fingers are slightly deformed. I can also see some calluses on her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'At least, those are not an heiress' hands.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The managing director thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace finished writing her name on the registration form, the familiar feeling of nausea suddenly came over her. Grace immediately covered her mouth and made a quick dash for the restroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason immediately got up and ran after Grace. Seeing this, the managing director and other staff of tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau also hurried to follow them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, a shocking scene appeared in tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A thin woman ran at the front, followed closely by a good-looking man who was trailed after by a group of staff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace rushed into the restroom. Seeing that Jason was about to rush into the restroom, the managing director quickly stopped him. "Master Reed... It... It's the ladies' room."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Master Reed barges in and becomes a laughing stock in Emerald City, I'll probably be the one to suffer,' The managing director thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together tightly, and his mind flashed back to the way Grace threw up in front of him last time. Her face had been as pale as a sheet of paper at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get out of the way!" he said coldly and dashed right in. He saw the lean figure bending over as she threw up heavily into the toilet bowl in one of the stalls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was as pale now as she had been before and was puking so hard that it seemed as if she were going to throw up all the food she had eaten that morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason hurried forward and held Grace with one hand, helping her soothe her back so that she could feel a little more comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She threw up for a long time before she managed to look up at him and say, "What... What are you doing here? This is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know where this is. Do you often throw up so much?" he said as he frowned. Even if he did not want to show his feelings in front of her, he could not hide the concern and eagerness in his eyes no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not very often, but... I've been throwing up a lot lately." She did not have much morning sickness before, but nausea returned after saying a few words. Grace began to throw up again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, a group of staff and the managing director were staring at each other outside the restroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, one of them could not help asking, "Well... do we need to go in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The managing director glared at them. "Go in? Do you want to appear in gossip news? Just wait outside!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd could only wait outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only thing that comforted the managing director right now was that the dividers of the stalls in the ladies' restroom covered the top till the bottom. There was only a tiny gap at the ceiling. It was unlikely to cause any commotion with Master Reed barging in like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one knew how much time had passed, but Jason and Grace finally came out of the restroom.</p></div>
