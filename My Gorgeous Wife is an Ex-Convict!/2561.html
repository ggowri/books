        <h1>Chapter 2559</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does being dead or alive have anything to do with whether you love someone? I love Herman, and I want to marry him," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really not have feelings for George Gregory anymore?" Daley Moss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you still have feelings for someone who said they'd love you forever but just stood by when you were in trouble?" Amber Mitchell asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she did have feelings for him, they would only be hatred and disgust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss pondered for a while before saying, "You marrying my eldest brother is just a ceremony. No law recognizes that kind of relationship. If you ever meet someone worthy of your love and want to get married again, the Moss family won't stop you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't&mdash;" Amber Mitchell eagerly tried to guarantee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Daley Moss interrupted her, "Listen, I won't get mad if you want to get married again. I think my eldest brother would be able to rest in peace seeing you take things this far for him. It's just that... When you get married again, that person mustn't be George Gregory!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss added his conditions, "If you marry anyone else, the Moss family will give you dowry so you can marry with honor. I, Daley Moss, will always treat you as my sister-in-law. But if you choose to marry George Gregory, everything you did today will only turn the Moss family and my eldest brother into a joke! You'll make yourself an enemy of the Moss family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said with a stern expression, "Okay, I got it. But I don't think that will ever happen."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As far as she was concerned, no one would love her more than Herman. She was never going to love anyone else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A few days later, the Gregory family announced that George Gregory was divorcing Louise Mitchell. They also announced that Simon and Louise Mitchell were not mother and son. After all, Simon was George Gregory's biological son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, there was a lot of fuss in the media. All sorts of speculations were made. What they were most curious about was who Simon's biological mother was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the Gregory family did not announce the name of Simon's biological mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla and Grace, who were in Emerald City, naturally read the news and learned about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had been discharged from the hospital, but her daughter was still being treated in the neonatal department as she was born prematurely. Hence, she would come over every day to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she could only look through the transparent glass, she was happy to see the little one getting better day by day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can arrange a driver to pick you up if you want to visit your daughter every day," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's convenient for me to take a taxi, and the doctor said Trista can be discharged in two weeks. I won&rsquo;t have to come to the hospital every day by then," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How are you recovering?" Grace asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Pretty good. Look, I can walk on my own now. My indicators are also fine when I had my follow-up check-up." Kyla could not help saying emotionally, "I didn't think I was going to make it. I asked the doctor how my liver is doing and he said it's fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes glimmered slightly at that. 'It's fine because... Martin Weiss donated his liver to Kyla again, but Kyla has no idea about this!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, have you... ever contacted Martin Weiss again?" Grace could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook her head. "We're no longer in touch, and I've moved out of his apartment. I guess that's it for us. This is good. He won't be sad in case anything happens to me."</p></div>
