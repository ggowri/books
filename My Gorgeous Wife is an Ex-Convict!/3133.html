        <h1>Chapter 3131</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're going to marry Brian?" Camille looked shocked as she visited Valda's apartment after work and received such explosive news from her friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mm-hmm." Valda blushed and stammered, "But... not right away, it's a year later, a year later for the wedding. I want to use this year to buy a good house, bring my godmother over, and then rehabilitate my legs well, hoping to improve my walking a bit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille looked at her friend, then at the busy figure in the kitchen, "How did you come to this decision?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just... talked to Amber for a bit, and then I happened to have a minor collision while taking a taxi. I was calling Brian at the time, and my phone fell and went black. Brian couldn't reach me on my phone, so he rushed over to find me. When he hugged me, I suddenly came to my senses." Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if all the entanglements were being unraveled in that moment. She knew she didn't want to miss this man and regret it in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she and him might face many difficulties together, and many people might ridicule and mock them, she still wanted to try her best to face them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's really..." Camille laughed, "If I had known, I should have let Amber persuade you earlier. If I see her next time, I really should thank her, otherwise you wouldn't know how long you would be stuck in this dead end."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt a bit embarrassed as she touched her nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille said seriously, "Valda, no matter what, you deserve to be happy. If you have any difficulties or troubles, even if I can't solve them, you must tell me. Don't bear them alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at her friend. Camille had been with her through the darkest times since college.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Camille, thank you," she said, her eyes turning red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you thanking me for? It's awkward to hear you say thank you," Camille said, looking at her friend's red eyes. "Okay, don't cry anymore. If Brian sees you like this, he'll think I bullied you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He won't think that. He knows you're my best friend!" Valda said, then raised her hand and hugged Camille. "Camille, I will be happy, I will definitely be very happy. I am also prepared to face difficulties. Sometimes, difficulties and hardships may be God's way of making people cherish happiness more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Brian walked out of the kitchen, he saw Valda and Camille hugging each other. When they heard him coming, they separated, and he saw that her eyes were red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? What happened?" Brian asked Valda nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing, you don't have to worry. I'm really okay. It's just that having a good sister like Camille is really rare," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really... is that all?" Brian asked.</p></div>
