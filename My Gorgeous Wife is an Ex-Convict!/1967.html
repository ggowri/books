        <h1>Chapter 1965</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He saw Lina sleeping at his door, clutching her pregnancy pillow. She had a blanket under her and another one over her. However, the sound of him opening the door startled her. She opened her sleepy eyes and looked at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The way she rubbed her eyes reminded him of a cat cleaning its face, and there was something indescribably cute about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, he heard her exclaim, "Hadwin, are you okay now?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As she spoke, she got to her feet and ran her hands over him. She even stood on tiptoes to feel the temperature of his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm okay," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina found that the temperature of his forehead was indeed normal. The temperature of his body was no longer as hot as yesterday, and she let out a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yesterday... Uh, did someone drug you?" Lina asked in a whisper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson narrowed his eyes slightly as he stared at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She blushed and said quickly, "I... It&rsquo;s just a guess. The way you looked yesterday... It looked like you were drugged... Uh... I see it in novels and comics. Did someone set you up? Did someone plan on marrying you after you did the deed with them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson had no idea whether to call Lina smart. Sometimes, she seemed painstakingly stupid, but she got it right this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He muttered, "Yes, someone set me up, but it won't happen again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His face darkened as he spoke, and a cold gleam flashed across his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she was frightened by his coldness and instantly shut up. She thought of him like a hibernating beast. He would strike a fatal blow to anyone who crossed him and made an enemy of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter?" He raised his eyebrows slightly, noticing her strange reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just find you... a little scary just now," she mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes glimmered a little. "Lina, I&rsquo;ve always been a terrible man. Hurry back to Emerald City if you're scared!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She said, "I'm not going back! You're only intimidating to others, not me. I have nothing to fear!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She said it so matter-of-factly and confidently that it struck him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're so arrogant. What makes you think I can&rsquo;t intimidate you?" he said with a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why did you restrain yourself in front of me yesterday? You felt awful but still didn&rsquo;t want to hurt me. You'd rather lock yourself up in your room," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He pressed his thin lips together tightly. Her clear eyes stared at him so intently that he felt flustered. It was worse than when he almost succumbed to the drug the night before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if her eyes had seen right through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He instantly looked away. "Lina, that's enough!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She stood on her tiptoes and gently approached his ear. "Hadwin, you still love me, don't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her warm breath was in his ear, and his ears instantly reddened. He had no idea how to refute what she just said!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">During breakfast, Lina took out the cake they had not eaten last night from the refrigerator and said somewhat awkwardly and expectantly, "I kept the cake in the refrigerator. It may not taste as good as yesterday, but it should be fine. Well... Why don't we try a slice? I'll remove the candles..."</p></div>
