        <h1>Chapter 2309</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla walked out of the train station and saw the familiar yet strange scenery, she could not help feeling emotional.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She grew up in this city, fell in love with Martin Weiss here, and was sent to prison here. In the end, she chose to escape tMason Swansonty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today, she came back to tMason Swansonty of her own accord.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath, took out her phone, and called Martin Weiss's number. However, all she got in reply was a busy signal. She could not get through at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated and dialed another number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She got the number after she and Martin Weiss separated. One afternoon, Martin Weiss sent her a message with the number. He said she could call the number if she needed anything and someone would help her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just a moment later, the call got through and a man's voice came from the other end of the line. "Hello... Is this Miss Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hurriedly replied, "Ah. Yes, it's me! And you are..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm Chairman Weiss's personal secretary. Chairman Weiss told me you can tell me if you need anything!" they replied respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to see Martin Weiss. I'm already at L City's train station. But I can't get through to him on his phone. Can you get in touch with him for me?" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she said that, the other end of the line was silent for a few seconds before the person said, "Well... I'm afraid that may be a little difficult. Mr. Weiss said he'll never see you again, Miss Corbyn. That's why he asked me to take handle all of your matters.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla only tasted bitterness in her mouth. She was the one who requested him not to see her again, but now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have something important to tell him in person. Please help me contact him," she said in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They said, "Miss Corbyn, are you at L City's train station? Why don't I pick you up first? We'll talk about the rest after we meet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla thought about it and said, "Okay." Then, she gave him her exact location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There should be a KFC there. You can order a drink and wait there. I'll be there in about half an hour," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Half an hour later, a white car pulled up in front of the KFC outlet. A polite-looking man with glasses in his 30s stepped out of the vehicle. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After looking around, he walked up to Kyla. "Hello, Miss Corbyn. I'm Chairman Weiss's personal secretary&mdash;Mallory Malcom. You may call me Mallory," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He must have seen her photo or something from Martin Weiss, so that was why he could recognize her immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you booked any accommodation, Miss Corbyn?" asked Mallory Malcom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I booked Home Inn," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was one of those chain hotels where the locations were mediocre but their prices were affordable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mallory Malcom frowned a little and said, "Why don't I arrange somewhere else for you, Miss Corbyn? It's not very convenient for you to stay in such a hotel when you're pregnant. There's no panic button or anything of the like in small hotels if anything happens, so they can't come to assist you in time."</p></div>
