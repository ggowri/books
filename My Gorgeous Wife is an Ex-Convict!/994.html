        <h1>Chapter 993</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace... Grace&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is it that all I can think of right now is her name, face, and voice?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why does her not loving and not wanting me make me so desperate?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was as desperate as a drowning man losing his last lifeline!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It hurt&hellip; so much that he could hardly breathe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was the sound of the door opening and footsteps could be heard approaching. Then, there were sounds of things being put down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she back?' She went out to get him medicine in the middle of the night, just like she had done before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then when he opened his eyes and looked at her, it was the first time he had felt something like butterflies in his stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps he had fallen for her from then on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come, take the medicine. It'll make you feel better." Her voice rang in his ears, and a hand was helping him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His nose picked up her scent as his eyes opened slowly. He then caught sight of that comely face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The emptiness he felt was suddenly being filled up little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every nerve and every drop of blood in his body seemed to clamor for her! He wanted her to stay with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace handed the medicine to Jason. "There are two types of medicine. Take one pill for this type and two pills for the other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not take the medicine from her. His eyes were only looking at her almost greedily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt something indescribably heavy in his eyes. "What's the matter? You don't want to take the medicine?" She remembered him telling her that he hated taking medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if you're my sister and I can be your brother forever, you still won't want me?" he asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened and looked down at the medicine in her hand. She answered softly, "Mmm. Being siblings is just one of your games. Besides..." She smiled faintly, but her smile looked a little elusive. "You'll never be my brother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, her almond-shaped eyes met his. "Jason, I've loved you and hated you. Now, I don't want to love you, nor do I want you. A man like you isn't someone I can afford! One day, you'll get tired of this brother and sister game. When that time comes, we'll be over for sure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face grew paler, and even his lips seemed pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Over? Will it... really be over?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If it's really over between us, then I&hellip;' The thought that passed through his mind froze him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's up to you to take the medicine," said Grace as she put the medicine and water on the bedside table. Then, she turned around and grabbed a few things&mdash;namely a pillow, blanket, and a chair. She found a comfortable position and chose to rest there for the night. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared at the woman in the chair who had her eyes closed. After a while, he finally reached out, took the medicine on the bedside table, and swallowed the pills with water.</p></div>
