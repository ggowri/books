        <h1>Chapter 2621</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller thought she would never meet him again. After all, Emerald City was a big city. Imagine the odds of running into a stranger again in this city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She never expected to meet him here again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... are you doing here?" Valda Theller asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just finished talking to the owner here and saw you. Do you need my help?" he said pointedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're already helping by coming over." Valda Theller took a deep breath and looked at Raymond Bowman. "He's my boyfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman frowned and looked back and forth between Valda Theller and Brian. "He's your boyfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'm Valda's boyfriend. Is there a problem?" Brian said indifferently and raised his hand toward Raymond Bowman's hand, which was grabbing Valda Theller's wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman instantly felt a sudden pressure on his hand, which gave him a fit of pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't like people holding my girlfriend's hand like this. You'd better let go now or..." Brian did not finish his speech, but it was enough to let people know what he meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman pressed his thin lips into a line. His instincts told him that he was no ordinary man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a moment's silence, Raymond Bowman let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian also withdrew his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Valda Theller and said, "Do you want to go now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh? What?" She was still in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll get you out of here if you want, or I'll pick you up when it's over if you want to stay," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller thought about it and turned around to say to Camille Strickland and Keith Sharp, "Excuse me. I think I'd better leave first today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's... fine." Keith Sharp with after a dry chuckle. He could not help glancing at Raymond Bowman out of the corners of his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman was currently staring at Brian with a look of hostility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Hostility?' Keith Sharp froze. However, he noticed that the hostility on Raymond Bowman's face had disappeared, and Raymond Bowman's expression had returned to normal when he wanted to get a closer look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland's eyes widened. She was still in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh, is this the boyfriend Valda talked about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Are fraudsters this classy now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I would be fooled too if it were me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Valda Theller left with him, Camille Strickland suddenly came to her senses and realized that she... she had let Valda leave with that fraudster!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh! Is she going to be okay?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller got into Brian's car and was still in a trance. "What a coincidence... Fancy meeting you here again. I was thinking we might never see each other again since we didn't give each other our contact information."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know your contact information," he said and reported her phone number and address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at him with surprise on her face. "How do you know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your name is Valda Theller. You&rsquo;re a professional comic artist with your own studio. Your parents died young..." The shock in her expression increased with every word he said.</p></div>
