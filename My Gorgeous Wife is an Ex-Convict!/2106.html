        <h1>Chapter 2104</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Ecstasy flashed across Martin Weiss's face. 'It's true! She&rsquo;s saying she wants to marry me. Does that mean I still have a place in her heart and that she still has feelings for me&mdash;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she continued, "But I hope that we can get divorced after the baby is one year old. Also, we can just get married without any wedding. And things will remain the same after we get married. I'll stay at my house while you'll stay at yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The smile on Martin Weiss's face gradually disappeared. He looked blankly at her with a pale face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It turned out she only wanted to marry him to give the child a proper identity. Even before they got married, she was already planning a divorce a year later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not want to live with him after they married. She still wanted nothing to do with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was just a tool to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss looked blankly at Kyla and stayed silent for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The ward was silent, and the air pressure seemed to have dropped quite a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, Kyla spoke up to break the silence, "Will you marry me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss smiled bitterly and murmured, "Do you have any feelings for me since you want to marry me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Even just a little bit?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, her answer disappointed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No." Her voice was so confident that there was not even a moment's hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Pain flashed across Martin Weiss's eyes, and he suddenly laughed. However, his laughter sounded so miserable and bitter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla only found his laughter weighing her down and leaving her breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's laughter finally stopped after a long time. He looked at her with red eyes. "Okay, I'll do it. I'll do whatever you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"In that case, contact me when you&rsquo;re discharged from the hospital. We'll go to tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau to get the marriage license," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," replied Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla turned around and left the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss closed his eyes in agony and murmured, "It turns out that... this is karma. This is karma. Kyla, how cruel can you be to me? Will you not feel a hint of pity for me even if I spend the rest of my life trying to make things up to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could only swallow it without the slightest reproach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because he had never felt any pity for her back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He deserved all of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll register my marriage with Martin Weiss in a few days," Kyla said to Grace and Lina in the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Both looked startled when they heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace only knew Kyla had decided to keep the child, but she had no idea Kyla even planned to marry Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was even more surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, you... You're pregnant? Have you and Martin Weiss gotten back together?" Lina only found the world was changing a little too fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "No, we're just going to register and get a marriage license to give the child a legitimate identity so that there won&rsquo;t be as much gossip. I&rsquo;ll divorce him in a year, and we&rsquo;ll continue to live separately. We&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with each other."</p></div>
