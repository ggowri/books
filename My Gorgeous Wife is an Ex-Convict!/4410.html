        <h1>Chapter 4408: Want to Date</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley blinked his eyes. So, he had thought it was an illusion earlier, which made him so bold. But now, realizing </span><span>it's</span><span> reality, he's panicking like this?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not blaming you for anything, besides, I chose to do this!" Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was taken aback, staring at her blankly, seemingly unable to react.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley let out a sigh, "Do you think you can force me to do this if I'm not willing? So, you don't need to apologize. After all, it's a matter of mutual consent!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's pale face slowly turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said... this is what she wanted. Does that mean... she actually...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked into her eyes, seeing a hint of anticipation. Yet, he feared it was just his own wishful thinking. His lips quivered, but in the end, he said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I like you, Calvert!" Harley blurted out. Now that she was sure of her feelings, she decided to tell him straight up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though the future holds many uncertainties, and she might get hurt again, at least for now, she doesn't want to live with regrets!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... you like me?" Calvert asked, his lips trembling, looking at Harley in disbelief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I like you, so stop overthinking," she said. Of course, he would overthink. It was partly her fault. In this relationship, her attitude had been too ambiguous. She had even told him that they were together, but without any official status, without any obligations or responsibilities.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about it, these must be the sources of his unease, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvert, I like you, so, let's date," Harley added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert looked utterly bewildered. What was she talking about? Dating? Her and him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how could this be possible? He must have heard it wrong!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? At least give me an answer, don't you want to?" His prolonged silence prompted Harley to ask again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally snapping back to reality, Calvert swallowed the saliva that had pooled in his throat, "Are... are you asking me out?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Right, since you like me and I've realized I like you too, it's better for us to be together, bound by responsibility to each other. After we start dating, we'll be boyfriend and girlfriend," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really... you want to date me? You're not joking?" Calvert still couldn't believe it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley thought for a moment, then leaned over and kissed the other person's lips. "Now, do you believe me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's eyes widened. It was only at this moment that he truly believed she really wanted to be with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"However, we'll have to wait until the medication in your system has completely metabolized before I take you to meet my parents," Harley added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, given his current physical condition, if anything unexpected happened in front of her parents, it would probably be a huge embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face was flushed with embarrassment, as if stained with blood, yet the corners of his lips curled up in a charming smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That smile, it was so captivating, it had Harley utterly mesmerized!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A few days later, Calvert's body was finally back to normal. All the blood tests done at the hospital showed normal results.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the Hart Mansion, Harley brought Calvert to meet his parents.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert looked visibly tense, while Harley, on the other hand, appeared completely calm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sitting on the sofa directly across from them were Brian and Valda, looking at the man their daughter had brought home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert and his family had often heard their daughter mention this young man over the past couple of years. However, this was their first time meeting him, and it was as their daughter's boyfriend.</span></p></div>
