        <h1>Chapter 1380</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn gently lowered her eyes. "Since it&rsquo;s like this, I don't regret meeting Martin Weiss in this life. Maybe it's fate... But I just hope I won't meet Martin Weiss again in my next life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips together. Even if Kyla had accepted her fate, she would not accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must do something to keep Kyla alive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace came to Reed Group after leaving the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The company's receptionist and security guards recognized her. After all, the image of Grace standing at the entrance to meet the president last time was still fresh in their minds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had thought the president would not want to meet with her last time, but in the end, the president asked Secretary Jackson to take her to his office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, they were a little unsure whether to let her in this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace wanted to call Jason to explain the situation, she saw Terrence passing by not far away. She immediately shouted, "Secretary Gao!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing Grace, Terrence immediately hurried forward and said, "Young Madam, why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he addressed her as immediately shocked the receptionist and the others who were following Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm here to see Jay, but I forgot to call him and tell him before coming over," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed is probably in a meeting right now. Why don't I accompany you to Master Reed's office and you can wait for him there?" Terrence said respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded. Then, Terrence said something to the people around him before going into the elevator with Grace. He even pressed the elevator button himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Terrence was only a secretary and not a senior executive in Reed Group, many senior executives were respectful to Secretary Jackson because he had been working with Master Reed for many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Secretary Jackson had never been so respectful to a woman before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way he had called her &lsquo;Young Madam&rsquo; and the way she had called out &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The rest of the crowd looked at each other. A possibility had occurred to them, and the disbelief on their faces became more obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this Jay... Master Reed? Secretary Jackson seemed to be taking that woman to Master Reed!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... Uh... Young Madam seems to be pregnant," someone said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It suddenly occurred to everyone that although the woman's limbs were thin, her belly was indeed protruding. However, it was not protruding much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If that woman is pregnant, then the baby in her belly is... Master Reed's?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If that's true, the news will set the whole city alight!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace followed Terrence to the president's office, which she had been to several times before. As such, she did not need Terrence to accompany her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can go deal with your matters now. I'll just wait here," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, you can always look for the secretary outside if you need anything," Terrence said and left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was the only one left in the large office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked around the office. Her identity and situation now were different from the last time she was here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, she had come here to beg him to help with Lina's hospital bills, and her heart had been full of despair.</p></div>
