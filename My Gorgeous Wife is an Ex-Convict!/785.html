        <h1>Chapter 784</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Inns don&rsquo;t have a nice environment. Hotels have a better environment," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can only afford an inn with the money I have right now," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina hurriedly said, "If you're worried about not having enough money, I can&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina, thank you for your kindness, but I want to do this on my own," said Grace. 'Yes, I have to rely on myself to survive in this world.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina opened her mouth, but in the end, she said nothing. She knew that her best friend had her pride!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After booking the inn, Lina asked Hadwin to buy some food. Then in the room, she asked her best friend what exactly happened and why she broke up with Jason for no reason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He said he was tired and didn't want to love me anymore. He never really believed me throughout this relationship." Grace smiled bitterly and said in self-mockery, "I guess I'm not suited for a relationship after all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, don't smile like that. It makes me sad when you smile like that." Lina suddenly hugged her and said, "Grace, just cry if you want to cry. Aren't we best friends? I'll be on your side no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason hurt you. I'll help you find a better boyfriend and you can piss him off when the time comes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't keep all your grievances and sadness in your heart. Vent it out whenever you have to!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina kept saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace leaned on her best friend's shoulder and felt that the coldness in her body was finally fading away now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'My lifeline is Lina after all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How am I ever gonna repay Lina for being so kind to me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... can't cry. I must&rsquo;ve finished all my tears," murmured Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, Lina. I'm not as fragile as you think. It's just having my heart broken. It's not like it's never been broken before," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina sighed and looked at her best friend who was in front of her. Then, in a tone of mock relief, she said, "You're right. It's only having your heart broken. It's no big deal! It's just losing one guy. There&rsquo;ll be a better one!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A better one?' Grace's eyes dimmed. 'I'm afraid I'll never have the courage to date for the third time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I may be doomed to a lonely life.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina helped Grace pack her bags and waited until Hadwin came with the dinner he bought. They then ate dinner with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Hadwin came up, he even bought a cake and birthday candles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina put the candles on. The candles formed the digits &lsquo;28&rsquo;, and the colors looked so bright.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, we can finally eat your birthday cake together. Make a wish, Grace!" said Lina. Even though today was a bad day, she still hoped that Grace could spend her birthday well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least she had someone to share the cake with on her birthday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Wish&hellip;' Grace looked at the candles. 'My wish was to grow old with Jason, have children with Jason, and have a happy family together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But my wish now&hellip;' She closed her eyes slowly.</p></div>
