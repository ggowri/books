        <h1>Chapter 437</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now when she thought about it, her wardrobe back then only had her work attire and the kind of clothing that Sean liked. She hardly had any clothes that she truly liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that she did not do many things for herself in the past. Most of the time, she was busy trying to please other people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I wish I had known you earlier,&rdquo; Jason mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had known her earlier, perhaps they would have a better start. She would not need to go through three years of jail time and he would not need to be afraid of certain truths that she may find out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt that Jason&rsquo;s gaze contained plenty of emotions that she did not understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; He took her hand and they went downstairs. As she was going for a health checkup, she had to fast until she was done at the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason led Grace to the car. He noticed that she was using the hair tie he bought for her yesterday. It was a simple black hair tie, but it was better than the one she was using yesterday where the inner white rubber band was already exposed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It made him feel much more comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was such an important person to him, yet he never took note of these before? The thought of him noticing her hair tie yesterday made him once again feel a sense of heartache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never experienced such emotions in the past. She was the only person who could make him experience the disappointing feeling of &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so filthy rich yet I still let her wear such worn-out hair ties&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had not gone to prison, all these would not have happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It could be said that he was not the sole cause of her current poverty, but he was part of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Is this hair tie good?&rdquo; Jason casually asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; Grace replied. The price was rather steep, but its quality was undoubtedly much better than the ones she used to buy from the roadside stalls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Later, I&rsquo;ll get someone to buy a few other brands for you to try and compare. That way, you&rsquo;ll know which is better.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that. Those we bought yesterday can last me a long time,&rdquo; Grace immediately responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Consider it as me trying to spoil you a bit. Can&rsquo;t I? It&rsquo;s normal for a boyfriend to buy things for his girlfriend regardless of the amount, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s heart skipped a few beats as a sense of sweetness rushed out from her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Spoil me a bit? It seems that other than my mother, nobody else has ever said that to me. Not even Sean.&rsquo; When she was with Sean, he did buy her some branded goods, but he had never said those words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, at that time, she assumed that his mere action of buying her branded goods was him spoiling and loving her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now when she thought about it, perhaps Sean merely wanted her to dress in something that could match his status.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she kept telling herself to be strong and rely on herself for everything, deep within her heart, she still wished that someone would spoil her once in a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the hospital, Jason brought Grace to the health screening center. Jason had booked a VIP package, so she did not need to queue up. Instead, they just went straight to the VIP section.</p></div>
