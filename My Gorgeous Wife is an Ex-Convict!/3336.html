        <h1>Chapter 3334</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the video, he saw her looking sad and upset, but he couldn't do anything except say some comforting words. He couldn't hug her or stay with her all the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William and Lawrence still haven't been found," Jasper choked up and said, "And... when he got into trouble, he once called me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is also the most heartbreaking thing for her, she didn't receive that phone call at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she answers the call, can she tell her mom and dad earlier and ask for their help to save Lawrence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is not your fault, anyone can miss a phone call," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper choked up and said, "I want to find Lawrence. Mommy, Daddy, and the police have been looking for him, but they haven't found him yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will find out, and I will also ask my father for help," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William, thank you," said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On that day, the Barlow family had dinner together with the Reed family, and after dinner, William accompanied Jasper to his room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William noticed that on Jasper's desk, there was a photo of Lawrence and Jasper together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She has very few photos with Lawrence, only a few, and this is one of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this photo, she and Lawrence are looking at each other and smiling, both of them seem to be very happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her smile was bright, while Lawrence, though a bit shy, smiled sweetly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William looked at Lawrence in the photo, and the way Lawrence looked at Jasper with such affectionate eyes reminded him of himself. He must have looked at Jasper the same way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had a complex feeling that he couldn't quite put into words when he found out Lawrence was missing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once, he had hoped that if Lawrence had never appeared in Jasper's life, she wouldn't have focused so much attention on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He doesn't like how much Jasper cares about Lawrence, it makes him feel anxious as if Jasper might be taken away by Lawrence if things continue this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But despite seeing Jasper so sad and upset, he would rather have Lawrence there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she feels bad, he also feels bad, even worse than when Lawrence is around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, have you visited Auntie Valda's newborn baby?" William intentionally brought up a lighter topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper shook his head and said, "Not yet. Mom and Dad have already gone to see the baby. They said we'll have to wait until Auntie Valda is discharged from the hospital before we can go see the baby. It might take a few more days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then let's go see the baby together when the time comes. I also want to see the little one," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Jasper replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William intentionally shared some interesting stories and experiences he had in Deer Capital with Jasper, hoping to distract her from constantly thinking about Lawrence and feeling guilty and sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, in the living room downstairs, Philip was chatting with the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't expect Lawrence, this child, to have such a big impact despite not knowing Jasper for long," said Philip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, these two kids got along well, but we never expected this kind of outcome," Grace sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If that child really died, it would be even harder for Jasper to accept. But now that he's missing, it's a silver lining in a bad situation, at least giving people some hope," said Philip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hope?" Jason said calmly, "They only knew each other for a few months. Jasper is still young. After five or ten years, she will eventually forget."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's true, but they were just friends who knew each other for a few months," said Philip. "What about you guys? After the police stop searching, do you plan to continue looking for him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We will," Jason said. "We will increase manpower to search for at least a year. If we can't find him within a year, then we'll have to rely on luck."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, if no one can be found nationwide within a year, the chances of finding someone afterwards are very low.</p></div>
