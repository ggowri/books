        <h1>Chapter 3349</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But your daddy and mommy sleep together, and so do mine," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But they are a married couple!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, let's become husband and wife."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was dumbfounded when she heard this. Even though Mason was two years younger than her, he should still know what being a couple means, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, how can we be husband and wife? We are siblings!" Veronica corrected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why can't older sister and younger brother be married?" asked Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course not!" Veronica said. For her, this was a simple matter of habit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why not?" He persisted in asking why.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But 12-year-old Veronica couldn't explain the question at the moment, so she could only say, "It's just not allowed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if it's not allowed, I will make us husband and wife," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica stared at the person in front of her. She knew how stubborn he could be, so she didn't continue to argue with him about the previous question. Instead, she said, "Mason, I hope you can always be my good little brother, okay? We've grown up now, and it's inconvenient to sleep together, but other than that, everything can be the same as before!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Veronica deliberately softened her tone, which eased Mason's expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I want to sleep with you," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But we've grown up now, and the other girls in our class sleep alone, so...I want to sleep alone too, okay?" Veronica showed a look of longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason stared at her with his beautiful eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason?" Veronica spoke again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you really want to sleep alone?" asked Mason gloomily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica nodded vigorously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason furrowed his eyebrows, as if pondering something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, he asked, "What should I do if I can't fall asleep?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How about I keep you company when you can't sleep?" Veronica suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason reluctantly nodded at Veronica's words, and a look of joy appeared on her face. She immediately hugged Mason and said, "It's settled then. Whenever you can't sleep, I'll keep you company, but otherwise, you need to sleep in your own room."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason hugged the other person, burying their face in their shoulder. He felt happy because she was happy too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time, for some reason, he felt a sense of emptiness in his heart, as if something was slowly leaving him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda is a new mother and naturally wants to take care of everything for her child. However, in reality, she doesn't have to do much besides breastfeeding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the evening, after feeding her daughter once again, Valda looked at her daughter's big phoenix eyes and liked her more and more. Her daughter's genes combined well, with some features resembling Valda and others resembling Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to Lina's words, when this child grows up, she may charm a lot of men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's mind suddenly flashed scenes from soap operas where multiple men pursued one woman. She had even drawn such scenes in her early comics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If there are really several men pursuing her daughter at that time, should she give her child some advice and suggestions?</p></div>
