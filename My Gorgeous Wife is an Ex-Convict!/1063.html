        <h1>Chapter 1062</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina and Hadwin Stephenson came to Reed Residence, but they did not see Jason at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">According to the Reed family's butler, Jason never brought Grace back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, when Lina asked to enter Reed Residence, the Reed family's butler rejected her! Therefore, Lina could only glare at the entrance of Reed Residence while stomping her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at his anxious girlfriend and realized Grace's importance in Lina's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I was taken away, would you be this anxious to find me too?" asked Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned, then she did not know whether to laugh or cry. "Why are you asking such a question at such a time? You're not jealous of Grace, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what if I'm jealous?" asked Hadwin Stephenson as he stared at the person in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina blinked and thought for a while. Suddenly, she stood on her tiptoes and grabbed Hadwin Stephenson's collar with her two hands. She pulled him down and kissed him on his thin lips. "Alright, be a good boy. You're the one I love. Grace's my bestie, so stop being jealous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, it was Hadwin Stephenson who did not know whether to laugh or cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That kiss was so perfunctory!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lina was already urging Hadwin Stephenson. "Help me think of a way to enter Reed Residence. Why don't we... just climb over the gates?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Lina seemed to want to try it out. Hadwin Stephenson quickly stopped the woman. "Are you trying to kill yourself? There's electric wiring on the top of the gates. You'll die immediately if someone turns on the power!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was shocked, and her face turned pale. "Nothing works. How can we find out whether Grace is in there or not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was worried about Grace's safety. 'Jason is still in love with Grace, but the problem is... she no longer loves Jason!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina paced back and forth with worry while Hadwin Stephenson rubbed his forehead. He was only glad that Grace was a woman. Otherwise, he would have a formidable, almost invincible, rival!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "Let's check the surveillance footage. I'll have someone check the surveillance around here to see if Jason brought Grace back here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's eyes lit up immediately. "By the way, can we find out where Jason took Grace from the surveillance footage even if he didn't come back here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson frowned and said, "Maybe not. If we can think of checking the surveillance footage, won't Jason think of it too? With his ability, he has plenty of ways to prevent people from finding out where he has gone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's eyes immediately darkened again. "Then Grace..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let's check it out first. We'll take one step at a time. Who knows? Maybe Grace will be back in her rental house by tomorrow morning." Hadwin Stephenson comforted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina bit her lip slightly. 'That's the only thing we can do for now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not expect Jason to lock her up in here. He even took her phone away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not contact anyone at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She pursed her lips tightly as she looked at the torn gown on the floor. The delicate gown looked like a rag now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but smile bitterly. She did not expect the gown Bryn gave her to turn out this way after only one night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help recalling the scene of the night before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she said "Jason, I don't want you", he eventually left her alone and chose to leave the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stayed up all night in the room.</p></div>
