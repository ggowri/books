        <h1>Chapter 1203</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly dialed Lina's phone number, but a busy tone sounded from the other end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace called several times consecutively, but none of them got through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A strong uneasiness immediately surged in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Nothing... can happen to Lina!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly began to search online for Hadwin Stephenson's news and current whereabouts. However, the latest news about Hadwin Stephenson was only the gossip news she saw earlier about him being missing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Hadwin Stephenson was only a businessman, not a celebrity. Though he was the patriarch of the Stephenson family, the attention he got would still be limited after all. Therefore, the news did not become very popular either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is going on with Lina? Why isn&rsquo;t Lina picking up her phone?' Grace also tried texting, sending WeChat messages... and so on. She tried every possible way to reach her, but there was no reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated for a moment and finally called Lina's parents. She had saved the number in her phone, but she never called the number because Lina&rsquo;s parents hated her after her accident and imprisonment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Lina's parents had good reason to hate her. After all, it was because of her that Lina gave up on her studies and was now working as a small designer in a small design firm upon returning to the country.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's phone call was on the line for quite a while before someone finally answered it. A nasal-sounding female voice came from the phone. "Hello, who is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's... Lina's mother!' thought Grace. She said, "It... It's me. You must be Mrs. Sweeney. I'm Grace&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she could finish speaking, Mrs. Sweeney yelled like she was venting, "Why are you calling me? If you feel any gratitude to Lina, don't bother our family at a time like this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Mrs. Sweeney just hung up the phone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked and wanted to call her back, but no one answered. She figured that Mrs. Sweeney had blacklisted her number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately got up, grabbed her wallet and keys, and ran out of the rental house to head to the Sweeney family's residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she got to the Sweeney family's house, nobody answered when she rang the doorbell. Instead, the Sweeney family's next-door neighbor came out and said, "Are you looking for them? They've all gone to the hospital. No one's at home!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The hospital?" Grace was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I heard their daughter is seriously injured and is receiving emergency treatment at the hospital! I have no idea how things are going," muttered the neighbor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze. "What did you say? Lina is seriously injured and is receiving emergency treatment at the hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's what I heard," they replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Which... Which hospital?" Grace's lips trembled as she asked the question. The words seemed to have been forced out of her mouth with all her strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After knowing the specific hospital, Grace quickly rushed out of the neighborhood and took a taxi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the way, she kept telling herself that she would be fine. Lina would be fine. Maybe the so-called &lsquo;serious injury&rsquo; was misheard by the neighbor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she told herself so, her body was shaking uncontrollably while her heart beat wildly.</p></div>
