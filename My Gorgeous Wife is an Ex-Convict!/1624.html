        <h1>Chapter 1622</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't want Lina to get injured again. Besides, I caused today's conflict. It&rsquo;s all the more reason I can't ignore Lina!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you're really worried, then I'll have someone find out where Hadwin Stephenson has taken Lina to..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Grace's phone rang. The caller ID showed Lina's name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace quickly answered the phone and heard her best friend's voice on the other end of the line. "Grace, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm fine. What about you? I heard from Jay's men that you were taken away by Hadwin Stephenson. Do you want me to come and pick you up?" Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No. I... I'll go back by myself later. Don't worry. Hadwin Stephenson won't do anything to me." Lina could not help looking at Hadwin Stephenson, who was standing in front of her, as she spoke. She happened to meet Hadwin Stephenson's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Instantly, Lina looked down and continued to ask about Grace's current situation. After confirming that her best friend and Jason had already left the place of the incident in their car and that Jason's men had also taken care of Anthony Sherman, she finally felt relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After ending the phone call with Grace, Lina called Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yulai, I'm sorry. I asked you to go shopping with me today but such a thing happened. How are you doing..." asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The word &lsquo;Yulai&rsquo; only irritated Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Does she care so much about the man because she likes him? It's only natural for her to like another man, right? After all, I left her first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But why... is my heart so painful and unwilling?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She was so in love with me back then! She even wanted us to be together forever!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's good. Me? I'm fine. I'll talk to you later. Okay... Goodbye then." Once Lina ended the call with Anthony Sherman, she looked up to meet Hadwin Stephenson's burning gaze again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, there was a fleeting pain in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Pain?' Lina burst out laughing, blaming herself for overthinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Stephenson, thank you for... blocking those things for me," said Lina. She and Hadwin Stephenson both did not look good right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Though Hadwin Stephenson had quickly pulled her aside during the commotion, she was still hit by some of the filth. Hadwin Stephenson looked even worse than her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The person who was supposed to be glamorous was now covered in rotten vegetables and eggshells... Lina felt somewhat guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But you don't have to do all this. Hadwin Stephenson, we've broken up. You don't need to help me," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I don't need to?' Hadwin Stephenson's eyes grew cold. "Are you saying I don't have to save you or help you even if you were to die in front of me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That cold voice and the expression on his face that had turned cold suddenly made Lina feel a pang in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She bit her lip and spat out the word &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. His help would only make her think of him more and make it harder for her to get over him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His face grew colder, and his body seemed to be exuding a chill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
