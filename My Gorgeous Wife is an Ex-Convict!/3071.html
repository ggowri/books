        <h1>Chapter 3069</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille brought Valda to her place and at night, the two of them lay on a bed together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille said, "Come on, even if you haven't figured out how to deal with Brian, you haven't figured out how to deal with me either? You could have contacted me earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry," murmured Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, stop apologizing all the time. Do we really need to keep saying sorry to each other?" Camille said. "By the way, how did you manage to survive? It's been so long, why haven't the police or Brian found you yet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I never thought I would still be alive," Valda exclaimed. At the time when she put Jasmine in the basket, she was actually prepared to die. "I woke up two months ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Awakened two months ago?" Camille was surprised. "So, you were in a coma for 10 months?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After waking up, Valda told her friend what had happened, including how Lisa had saved her and how she couldn't contact the outside world when she first woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because it was a very backward village, even making a phone call required going to the neighboring village.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even at the very beginning of her recovery, she experienced a condition called aphasia, which made it difficult for her to speak and caused weakness throughout her body. She even struggled to write a single word with a pen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, even if she could really write, Lisa who saved her is illiterate and probably wouldn't be able to understand it at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later on, as time passed, her physical condition gradually improved and she was finally able to speak. It was then that she found out that she had been unconscious for a long time. Although her broken leg had been cast and treated, it had not been fully healed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And now, because the optimal treatment time has been missed, it is no longer possible to fully recover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yesterday, she hitched a ride with a kind stranger back to Emerald City, but she hadn't figured out how to face the situation yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Actually, last night, I saw Brian at the entrance of the community!" Valda murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?! You saw him?" Camille exclaimed in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Valda nodded. "At that moment, I actually wanted to go up and call out to him, but when I lifted my foot, I...saw the crutch I was leaning on and my foot..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you didn't go up to him, did you?" Camille said. "But Valda, do you know? No matter what you look like, Brian won't leave you. He will only love you more and cherish you more! These days, I've seen him miss you so much that he doesn't seem like a normal person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda remained silent and didn't speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, you're alive now, so you must have good fortune after surviving such a disaster. You and Brian will definitely be very happy!" Camille said, feeling full of heartache for her friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Happy... Valda gently closed her eyes, but now, she dared not hope for happiness anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Originally, he and she were like people from two different worlds, and now, she had a limp leg again. What made her suitable to stand by his side?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps from the beginning, they were destined to be apart. Everything...was forced by her at that time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was another day of meeting Brian once a week, usually Brian would send a car to pick up Camille, it could be a restaurant, Brian's villa, or a place that Valda and Brian had been to before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the past, every time Camille met with Brian, she only felt sadness and sorrow in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But this time, it's...nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda is still alive, but now they have to keep it a secret from Brian and wait until Valda figures out how to face the situation before telling him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille understands her friend's hesitation and insecurity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, people like Brian are already unattainable men, and Valda knows that this love may seem warm on the surface, but in reality, it is very difficult.</p></div>
