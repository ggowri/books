        <h1>Chapter 1986</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Got it. I won't go easy on you," Lina said with a smile. Suddenly, she seemed to recall something and said, "By the way, Kyla called me to ask about what happened. But Kyla's voice sounded a little off when we talked about Nelson. Is Nelson okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could not help but think of the little girl threatening Nelson at the primary school and said, "I'll go visit Kyla and see if they're in trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, great. I hope I'm just overthinking," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Compared to Lina, who was glad that there was no misunderstanding, Emily Flowers was furious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she saw footage of the scene playing on the news and how her son said to so many reporters and cameras that the baby in Lina's stomach would be the Stephenson family's heir whether they were a boy or girl, she felt like she was slapped in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her son ignored her and seemed to be telling everyone to lay their hands off Lina, as well as telling the world Lina's future identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Since Lina's child would be the Stephenson family's future heir, then the future mistress of the Stephenson family could only be Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She would not allow such a thing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mr. Stephenson, these are the people Anthony Sherman have gotten in touch with recently. He has resigned and booked a flight out of the country after his post went viral. It was as if he knew this was going to happen." A man placed an investigation report in front of Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked through the report. His eyes narrowed when he saw a name. It seemed that she was indeed the culprit behind Lina's undeserved misfortune this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The report showed that Anthony Sherman was at the airport when he called Lina. There was a trace of shock in Hadwin Stephenson's eyes when he saw a line of words when he got to the back of the investigation report.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It... surprised him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, his phone rang and a panicked voice came from the other end. "Mr. Stephenson, Madam called the police. Many police officers came and Madam has now left the mansion. We couldn&rsquo;t stop her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The &lsquo;Madam&rsquo; they were talking about was naturally Hadwin Stephenson's mother&mdash;Emily Flowers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson pondered for a moment. "I see. Return to the mansion and protect the place."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He thought his mother would prefer to keep the family's scandals on the down-low, but she unexpectedly called the police to force her way out. It was probably going to be all over the news tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could almost guess what his mother was up to. Had he been too kind to his mother?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked down, hiding the sadness in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I hope I got it wrong. If Mom doesn&rsquo;t go that far, perhaps I can let her off the hook and let her continue living her life in luxury and comfort. If she really...'</p></div>
