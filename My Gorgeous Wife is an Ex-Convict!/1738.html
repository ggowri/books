        <h1>Chapter 1736</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's heart trembled, feeling as though she was about to be bewitched by his voice. His embrace was so tight that he seemed to be trembling...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm gonna slap you if you don't let go!" She bit her lip and made a threatening remark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He suddenly chuckled and lifted his handsome face, which was instantly so close to her. "You can do it if you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She froze and stared blankly at the face that was right in front of her. She could slap him just by raising her hand but she could not bring herself to do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if the feeling of the time she slapped him still lingered on her palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, do you know how much I&rsquo;m suffering to embrace you like this?" he asked. The sarcasm had left his face, leaving only solemnity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, she noticed that his face had turned pale and his forehead was covered with a thin layer of sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are... you okay?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Instead of answering her question, he said, "I'm not afraid of suffering. What I fear most in life is not being able to be with you. Do you... understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina took a deep breath and said sternly, "You wouldn't have broken up with me if what you fear most is not being able to be with me. Hadwin Stephenson, what you fear most is losing the wealth and power you've worked so hard to gain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes darkened, and his face seemed to grow paler. "How can I protect you if I don&rsquo;t have all this wealth and power? Lina, you just don't understand how important these are!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Without them, Hadwin Stephenson would be just a nobody whom people could trample on. How could he protect her if he could not even protect himself?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Protect me?" Lina smiled bitterly. "Did you break up with me when I was lying in the hospital bed to protect me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I&mdash;" He opened his mouth, but she quickly cut him short.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If the breakup was supposed to protect me, then I'd rather you not protect me! If love needs to be protected by power and wealth, then it's too fragile!" She was not afraid of death but of being casually abandoned after loving someone deeply!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, you know nothing!" said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said, "Yes, I don't know you, but you don't know me either, Hadwin Stephenson. I've brought the clothes here. You don't need to return my clothes to me anymore. Just throw them away somewhere. They're worthless anyway. As for the future..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She paused and gazed at him. "You&rsquo;re now the president of the Stephenson family, and there's no threat to the status of the Stephenson family anymore. You can find another suitable woman. You don&rsquo;t have to pay an ordinary woman like me any more attention, and I'll also find someone who can live a peaceful life with me&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Stop it!" Hadwin Stephenson suddenly raised his hand and covered Lina's mouth. His hand with distinct joints quivered. "Lina, I told you to give me time. I'll prove that my feelings for you have never changed. I've done everything just to be with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina pulled down his hand. "But I can't afford to give you time. Hadwin Stephenson, I don't want to be with you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, she pushed him away forcefully, got up, and quickly left the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He sat on the couch as his hands shook and his teeth clenched, trying to suppress the pain in his body!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Blood curse!</p></div>
