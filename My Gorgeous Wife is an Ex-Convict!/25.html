        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing that Grace was trying to finish her work for the day, Chase shook his head. &ldquo;Excuse me. You&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ll go since you&rsquo;re busy.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Watching Chase leave, Jason suddenly grabbed Grace's chin with his fingers and half-forced her to face him straight. "I don't like you seeing other men like this. He doesn&rsquo;t look trustworthy.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace burst out laughing. "What are you thinking? I don't have any intentions towards him."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Does that mean he doesn't have those kinds of feelings towards you?" he asked back.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was at a loss for words.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is he the colleague who likes you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, I've already asked my friend Claire to help discourage him. He&rsquo;s a nice guy, and he means well. I&rsquo;m just not looking to get into a relationship. I didn't expect him to approach me today."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you don't like him, you should refuse him directly," Jason said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not worthy of you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace laughed. "You probably think too much of me. It is me that's not good enough for him. He has a house, a car, and a steady job. In our workplace, many girls like him."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You are worth much more than that," he said quietly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In his tone, there was a desire for possession that he had not even noticed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Grace cleaned the road and was preparing to pack up the tools to return to the Sanitation Service Center, Mia suddenly rushed up from the side of the building and said to Grace, "Can you please forgive me? I really can't lose this current job. This job is very important to me! I beg you, tell our director that you forgive me and ask him to cancel the order for dismissal, okay?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After thinking about it for a while, Mia still felt that Grace was most likely the one that she had offended.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace shook her head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken. I have no power here. I&rsquo;m not sure what you did or why you&rsquo;re being let go, but it has nothing to do with me. I have no connections with your director either."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's impossible!" Mia said anxiously. "You're the only one I've ever offended. Could it be that Sean saw you like that and couldn't bear it, and so he avenged you? Is that why I was condemned?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Thinking it over, there was only this possibility.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Only now did Grace finally understand the reason for Mia coming to her and begging her for forgiveness. &ldquo;Mia, you&rsquo;re chasing shadows. Sean ... he has no regard for me. He has not forgiven me, and I can assure you, he&rsquo;d not exert his influence to lift a finger for me!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You need to fix this,&rdquo; Mia argued.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Really? Grace was the victim of this bitch&rsquo;s machinations, but somehow Mia felt like she owed her something!? That was rich.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Look. I don't know what the hell you&rsquo;re talking about. And if you think Sean is to blame, then you should take it up with him,&rdquo; Grace said coldly, then she pulled Jason's hand and went around Mia.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mia still wanted to chase after her. However, when Jason turned around and gave her a light glance, she suddenly stopped in her tracks.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That line of sight suddenly caused her to feel a sense of fear. It was like if she continued to chase Grace and pester her, then her fate might end up even worse than it was now.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">What... what was going on? The man's face was mostly covered by too-long hair, so she couldn&rsquo;t really see his appearance. However, the eyes of this man scared her to the extreme.</p></div>
