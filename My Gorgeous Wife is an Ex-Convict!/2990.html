        <h1>Chapter 2988</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">You know, many people want to climb up to Brian, but they don't have the opportunity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And she had a chance presented to her, but she missed it, which is why she feels regretful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, you're not still holding a grudge about this, are you? I really did have your best interests at heart at the time..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zelda hadn't finished speaking when Valda interrupted, saying, "I can tell whether something is good for me or not, Zelda. I don't think we need to continue this conversation any further."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why is it not necessary, Valda? In high school, we were constantly ridiculed by others in our class. I think at that time, only we could truly understand each other's feelings. Now that you are Brian's girlfriend and I have finally found my life partner, my fianc&eacute; has been scolding me for offending you and Brian that day! Valda, please be kind and let my fianc&eacute; and I apologize to you and Mr. Hart over a meal as a way of making amends."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zelda spoke pitifully, and even as she spoke, her eyes turned red as if she could burst into tears at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Valda just looked at the other person with a cold expression in her eyes. She knew very well that the reason why the other person was stopping her and being so submissive was all because of Brian's relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no need for that," Valda said. "What happened that day is in the past and should stay there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, Valda was about to leave, but Zelda hurriedly grabbed her arm and said, "You can't just leave like this. It's important to apologize and make amends. Why don't you join us for a meal with Mr. Hart?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda chuckled, "Zelda, your apology is fake. You really just want to have a meal together, don't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zelda's face suddenly turned red and she said awkwardly, "How can you say such a thing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How else can I say it?" Valda said. "If you and your fianc&eacute; are hoping to establish some kind of relationship with Brian and the Hart family, then I think you should dismiss that idea as soon as possible. Neither you nor I have any relationship with them, let alone Brian!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda spoke and let go of Zelda's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zelda's expression finally changed, and she glared at Valda angrily. "Well, Valda, you've become successful and won't help out an old classmate, huh? Someone like you, how long do you think you can keep dating Brian? Sooner or later, he'll dump you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's expression remained unchanged as she calmly said, "Are you sure you want to continue? I recorded what you just said. If you keep going, I can't guarantee how Brian will retaliate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as these words were spoken, Zelda closed her mouth in anger and left, casting a jealous look at Valda before she went.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda shrugged and, regarding Zelda's last words, she might have cared before, but not anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I don't know how many people have said this before, and there are even many similar comments online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But she knows very well what kind of person Brian is.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How their relationship will turn out is not for others to judge. The only ones who can truly give a verdict are themselves.</p></div>
