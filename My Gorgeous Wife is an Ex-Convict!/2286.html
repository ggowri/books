        <h1>Chapter 2284</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn stopped speaking, and she looked at her daughter in disbelief, "What... What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I said, is it okay if I get back together with Martin Weiss?" repeated Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want to start over with Martin Weiss?" Mrs. Corbyn asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss mentioned to me in the hospital that he wants to be a real married couple with me, not just for show or for the sake of the kids," said Kyla as she took a deep breath. She looked at her mother, who had accompanied her through so many painful years. "Mom, I still have feelings for Martin Weiss. I don't know whether they&rsquo;ve always been there and I&rsquo;ve just ignored them, or they just started recently. But I think he has a place in my heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla confessed her feelings to her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After hearing that, Mrs. Corbyn said gently, "Since he has a place in your heart and seeing how you two have children together, it's good to start over with him. You haven't fallen for anyone after all these years. Perhaps you're destined to start over with him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mother, do you agree to this?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn said, "Why should I disagree? I've seen how he&rsquo;s been treating you all these years. If you want him to atone for his sins, he has done it. I just want you to get over it. Do you want to be with him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn knew that the biggest problem her daughter faced was the pain Martin Weiss had caused her. Her daughter first needed to overcome that fear if she wanted to be with Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla pressed her lips together tightly. After a long while, she finally said, "I want to be with him..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, I want to be with Martin Weiss. I want to take another chance to see if I can be happy in this life!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to run away and regret it later!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Perhaps it's like what Lina said. I&rsquo;ll just give it a try. If it still doesn&rsquo;t work out, at least I won't regret it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, in Martin Weiss's ward. Mrs. Weiss looked at her son on the hospital bed and snapped. "How could you keep such a serious incident from me? I would still be in the dark if my friend in the business world hadn't mentioned it to me. Do you even think of me as your own mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said hoarsely, "Mom, they're just minor injuries."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Minor injuries?" Mrs. Weiss's voice shot up instantly. "Are these injuries minor? You've got a broken rib, an abrasion in your head, and several cuts in your neck. You almost died from blood loss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "The doctor said that most of them are just skin trauma. I can be discharged in another week. I didn't tell you because I was afraid you'd be worried. Look, aren't you worrying too much right now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss said, "Are you scared that I&rsquo;ll be worried, or that I&rsquo;ll be angry at Kyla? You suffered all these wounds to save that woman Kyla, didn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had had someone look into her son's accident before coming to the hospital.</p></div>
