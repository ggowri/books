        <h1>Chapter 1254</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason turned his gaze to Grace again as he spoke, "I'm afraid your cousin won't have anything good waiting for her. What about you? Will you want to help your cousin?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said lightly, "No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just because she deliberately framed Chase Harper?" he said as if casually, but his dark eyes did not miss the slightest change in her expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said calmly, "That's partly the reason. I'm not a saint. I'm not going to help someone after they've repeatedly tried to hurt me and even innocent people. She'll never feel at ease and will want to get rid of me as long as she&rsquo;s impersonating me. Since I&rsquo;ve told Brian the truth, I&rsquo;ve already thought of the consequences."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Innocent?" Jason snorted. "Do you really believe that Chase Harper is innocent? Aren't you a lawyer? Aren't you supposed to trust the evidence? All the evidence is pointing to Chase Harper right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said firmly, "I do. Evidence is only superficial things. If you believe these superficial things too much, then it may lead to miscarriages of justice, which was also what happened in my case, wasn't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes glimmered a little before he went silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her case was a sore spot in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, Chase Harper is a good man. He's simple and kind. He shouldn't have been framed like this. Besides, Stella framed him because of me. I'm going to win this case for him no matter what, and even if I lose, I'm going to keep appealing and finding solid evidence for him!" Grace continued saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you want to help Chase Harper win this case no matter what, how about I help you?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze as if she was a little surprised. 'Doesn't he dislike Chase Harper? Why is he willing to help him?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You don't believe me?" he asked, raising his eyebrows when he saw the doubt in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." She shook her head. Since he had said so, she knew he would help her. However&hellip; "I'm a little curious as to why you would help Chase Harper."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's just say I want you to take good care of the babies with fewer things to worry about," said Jason as he gently lowered his eyes. If she lost the case, she would probably feel guilty toward Chase Harper forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she did not love Chase Harper, he did not want her to keep feeling guilty toward another man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then will you do me one more favor?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it to help you find out Hadwin Stephenson's whereabouts and why Lina got seriously injured?" he asked as if he already knew what was on her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. I want to know who did this to Lina!" She spoke the last part through clenched teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," he agreed readily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked as though she had not expected him to agree to it so easily. "Is that a yes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't want me to agree to it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's just..." It just went so smoothly that she was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you said you'll be a good wife and stay with me for the rest of your life, consider this my reward," he said, taking her right hand and gently rubbing her ring finger as if in thought. "Grace, I can give you whatever you want, but from now on, there can be no other man in your heart!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned, and her eyes met his deep gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't care if you hate me, blame me, or have some... feelings left for me, but from now on, the only man in your heart can only be me!"</p></div>
