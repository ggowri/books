        <h1>Chapter 980</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, when is this going to end?" she asked in a whisper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hands paused for a moment. Then, he looked up at her and smiled like how he had smiled at her back in their rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sis, there will never be an end between you and me!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would never allow her to end their relationship!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So much had happened that Grace could not sleep. When she arrived at the law firm the next day, Lawyer Carter looked at Grace and asked, "Were you alright yesterday? Are you sure you're not hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had called him yesterday when their call was suddenly cut off in the middle. When he dialed back, he could not get through, which made him worried for a while. He nearly called the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, she called him later and told him what had happened. He was relieved to hear from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I'm fine. I'll check out the results of the police investigation later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter said, "It's alright. I went to the police station this morning. The man who attacked you yesterday is Elise Dean's fan. He hired people to carry out the two previous attacks. Based on what you told me yesterday, we had the police conduct a simulation and concluded that the person wearing the ruby ring was in the driver's seat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was delighted at the news. 'If it&rsquo;s like this, the chain of evidence that proves Elise Dean was the driver is even clearer!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did the man who attacked me yesterday own up to attacking me twice?" she asked, a little confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No. Someone reputedly sent an investigation report to the police station last night. It has detailed evidence that the man has been looking for people online to lay a hand on you," said Lawyer Carter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. "Who gave the police the investigation report?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The police didn't disclose this," said Lawyer Carter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked down and thought about this. Usually, it was because the informant did not want their information to be revealed, so the police kept it a secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Jason... knew that she had been attacked twice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The first time was near her rental house while the other time was when she was kidnapped by two men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could it be Jason who gave the police the information?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because of the new findings, the court will delay the trial. We&rsquo;ll add Elise Dean as the new accused. The police have also reopened an investigation for the case, so it should be alright this time," said Lawyer Carter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing that, a smile came over Grace's face. 'At last, there's hope for Baldwin's medical bill.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've done a great job this time. You're good at finding the truth in the details." Lawyer Carter looked at Grace with sorry in his eyes. "Given your qualifications, it's a pity you're just a paralegal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled faintly. "I haven't given up on being a lawyer again. I took this job to regain experience."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that her experience of being wronged would put off clients from hiring her to represent them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, if a lawyer was wrongly convicted and failed to prove their innocence, people would naturally doubt their competence.</p></div>
