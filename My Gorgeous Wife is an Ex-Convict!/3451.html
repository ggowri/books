        <h1>Chapter 3449</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason is actually more mature than I imagined. He should be able to handle this matter well," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Deal with it? How does he plan to deal with it?" Grace asked, sounding puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nature has slowly cooled it down, don't worry, he shouldn't use any drastic measures," said Jason. Mason now seems to have learned patience and restraint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace breathed a small sigh of relief upon hearing this, "Actually, it would be good if Mason could slowly accept that Veronica has feelings for someone else. After all, human emotions are unpredictable. When people are together for a long time, they may only have a sense of familial love and not be able to develop romantic love no matter what."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason smiled lightly, knowing that his wife might have misunderstood something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, he'll gradually accept it, but accepting doesn't mean agreeing. If he wants to get what he wants, then he should fight for it in his own way," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace furrowed her brows slightly and asked, "What do you mean by that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The meaning is... he doesn't plan on giving up just like that. Right now, he needs to calm down and think about what to do next. He needs to figure out how to get along with Veronica," Jason said. "Do you think someone who is as important to Mason as his own life would just give up like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace realized, "But when it comes to matters of the heart, you simply can't force it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not something that can be forced. Besides, they're still young and going through a period of emotional instability. Who knows what the future holds?" Jason paused for a moment before continuing, "Perhaps Mason will eventually get what he wants? Or maybe, after experiencing setbacks, he will change his mind?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace hesitated for a moment and said, "Jason, I think it's best to let things take their natural course. I'm worried that Mason's emotions will be hurt, but Veronica is also someone I've watched grow up. If she really likes that boy named Daniel, I don't want the Reed family to interfere and ruin this relationship."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, if the Reed family were to use their power to interfere and put pressure on the Cross family, it's highly likely that the young couple would break up in no time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Jason readily agreed. "I won't use the Reed family's power to interfere with Veronica and Daniel's relationship. However, I am also Mason's father, so it shouldn't be a problem for us to have a heart-to-heart talk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace laughed when she heard this and said, "Of course, that's not a problem. If Mason is willing to open up to you, I would only be happy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the next few days, Mason continued to attend his classes as usual, but he stayed with the Reed family instead of returning to the Barlow family's home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the Barlow family's side, they are naturally very worried about this unusual situation. The Barlow family members are constantly asking Veronica, "Veronica, why did Mason suddenly move in with the Reed family? Is he not going to come back to the Barlow family anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I hope you didn't do anything to upset him again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm warning you, you need to understand who Mason is! If you make him unhappy, the Barlow family will be in trouble!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica didn't bother to pay attention to these scoldings. Every time there was any movement on Mason's side, her family would react like this!</p></div>
