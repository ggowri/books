        <h1>Chapter 4252 The Truth</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The better he treated her, the more accommodating he was to her, the more uncomfortable she felt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he was wrapped in layers of veils, and each seemingly thin layer could be easily seen through. But once those layers accumulated, it became increasingly difficult to see through!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt as if his standing in front of her was an illusion he carefully maintained. She thought she was gradually understanding him, but in reality, she understood nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why aren't you mad at me?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you're Tina." It seemed like this one explanation was enough!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina raised her head. "What if I'm not Tina? Would you still not be mad at me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled helplessly. "There's no 'what if' like that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." She glared at him, her teeth tightly biting her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, are you mad at me?" Chandler softly said, "Are you mad that I came back without telling you? And my phone was off, so you couldn't contact me. I promise I won't do that again. From now on, whenever you want to contact me, you can reach me anytime!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His slightly humble tone made the anger that had risen in Tina's chest disappear in an instant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really won't let me lose contact with you again?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really," he promised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then were you upset that day?" she asked again, "When I went to save Kit, were you very upset?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at the woman in front of him. At this moment, she was looking at him with those clear eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always looked at him with such clear and open eyes, to the point where it made him feel dirty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to hear the truth!" Tina said, "I don't want to hear lies. We've been through so much together, even though I don't remember the past now, I don't want to be surrounded by falsehoods. Chandler, I want to know what you really think."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pursed his thin lips. "I was indeed unhappy. I was afraid that if I had arrived later, you would have been in danger. I was afraid that you valued Kit too much, and I was also afraid that you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused for a moment. There was a sentence that had been suppressed in his heart, and now it finally came out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was afraid that the person you fell in love with was Kit, that you had feelings for him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of fear, he ran away!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't want to see her behavior toward Kit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I do have feelings for Kit, but it's not love!" Tina said frankly, "I hate that he deceived me, but when I see him now, I still feel sympathy. I think about how he rescued me from the village, how he protected me and the child during the car accident. </span><span>So</span><span> I don't want his fate to </span><span>be miserable. I hope he can live a good life too!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want the man in front of her to misunderstand, so she wanted to say everything she thought in her heart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Perhaps, before I knew he was deceiving me, I did like him and felt grateful, wanting to spend my life with him. But after knowing that it was all lies, I no longer like him!" Tina continued, taking two steps closer to Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, there was almost no distance between them. She looked up and could easily see her own face reflected in his pupils.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler, the person I want to love is you. That's why I want to be with you like this, why I rush to find you when I can't reach you on the phone, and why I care if you're angry. I don't want any misunderstandings between us!"</span></p></div>
