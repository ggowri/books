        <h1>Chapter 838</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe she should be glad that even though she and Jason did not take any contraceptive measures when they were together, it was difficult for her to get pregnant because of her uterine trauma. Therefore... She did not have to worry about getting pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least, she would not have any children with Jason. Even if they broke up, they could do it without any doubts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... She felt a faint regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had children, it would mean she could have a family member who was related to her by blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she did not have children now, she would end up without a family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it would be the same if she grew older and died alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled wryly. It was not until she met Nelson and saw his pretty, cute face that she felt a little better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Picking up Nelson, Grace kissed him several times and shared a slice of the cake she had specially bought for Nelson to make up for not having treated him to a cake on her birthday last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one was excited to give Grace the gift he had prepared himself&mdash;a beautiful pair of sandals with a leather bow at the toes. They were white, so they were easy to match her clothes in summer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The shoes looked romantic and feminine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was somewhat distracted as she looked at the shoes. She had not worn shoes like these in a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"These shoes are similar to Cinderella's glass slippers. You'll become a beautiful princess when you put them on!" said Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one spoke much more fluently now and was better than other children his age. He could even speak long sentences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled and put on her shoes in front of the little one, which unexpectedly fitted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you, Nelson. The shoes are beautiful and I like them very much," said Grace. She picked up the little one again and gave him a peck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson's pink cheeks reddened, and he gave Grace a sweet smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No wonder Kyla's desperate to hide such a cute and thoughtful child, worried that Martin Weiss would take him away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Nelson is probably Kyla's life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If only I have a child like Nelson.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she laughed at herself for overthinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To show her love for the shoes, Grace wore the new shoes and left with her old shoes in the shoebox. She also made a deal with Nelson that she would take him to the amusement park when she was free!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one's beautiful eyes lit up as soon as he heard that he would get to go to the amusement park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace realized that Nelson's eyes were kind of like Martin Weiss's! It was just that the way the little one smiled felt more like Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the shoes on her feet on the way home. 'Cinderella's glass slippers? Aren&rsquo;t I Cinderella?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Being with Jason was like putting on the glass slippers. However, her Cinderella dream had come to an end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back at the rental house, Grace took out her keys and opened the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as soon as the door opened, she stiffened immediately and almost dropped her keys!</p></div>
