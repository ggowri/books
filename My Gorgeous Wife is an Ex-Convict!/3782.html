        <h1>Chapter 3780</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you still with Mason? You shouldn't be with someone like him. I did this because I want you to see his true colors sooner!" Daniel said angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Good, her hand had reached for her phone! Veronica nervously held onto her phone and continued to ask, "What true colors?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, his despicable and selfish true colors," Daniel said. "Actually, I don't want you to see it, but I'm afraid you'll be too deep in it and I won't be able to save you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica slowly took out her phone from her bag and placed it next to her on the side near the car door. She used her body to shield the phone and quickly put it on silent mode. Then, she quickly dialed Mason's phone number from the quick dial interface.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She just hoped that when Mason answered the phone, he would sense that something was wrong on her end.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, she had to talk more to make Mason realize that something was off as soon as he answered the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If...if you still can't let go of what happened in the past, what do you want? Do you really want to 'save' me? Or do you have some conditions to talk to Mason?" Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Conditions? Do you want him to give me money? But can money buy my past life? You have no idea what I've been through!" Daniel said angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why don't you talk to him face to face? If he really did something that hurt you </span><span>badly in the past, then he will definitely make it up to you," Veronica sensed that Daniel's current state was a bit off, so she tried to calm him down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she glanced at her phone from the corner of her eye. The call had been answered, but she didn't hear Mason's voice on the phone. It was clear that Mason had already sensed that something was wrong.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make it up? How can he make it up? Veronica, do you think he can easily buy me off with money?" Daniel said fiercely. At that moment, the traffic light turned red and Daniel slammed on the brakes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah!" Veronica was caught off guard, even though she was wearing a seatbelt, her body still moved forward due to inertia, and her phone, which was originally hidden by her side, was suddenly thrown to the middle of her and Daniel's seats.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica instinctively wanted to retrieve her phone, but the other hand was faster than her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're actually talking to Mason on the phone?! Veronica, you're really despicable!" Daniel's face immediately changed as he looked at the call display on the phone screen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Give me back my phone!" Veronica said urgently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, Mason's voice came from the phone, "Daniel, no matter what grievances there are between you and me, it has nothing to do with Veronica. Don't involve her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Haha, the Reed family's high and mighty Mason, even at this time, your tone of voice sounds like you're giving orders. Today, I will make Veronica understand that she shouldn't be with someone like you." After saying this, Daniel hung up the call, then put the phone on the other side of him near the car door.</span></p></div>
