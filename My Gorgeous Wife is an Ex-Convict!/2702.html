        <h1>Chapter 2700</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, you won't refuse to cooperate, will you?" Patrick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at the flustered Valda Theller, hesitated for a moment, and said, "Why don&rsquo;t we change it to her lying underneath while I do the push-ups? We said we could take the punishment for others, didn't we?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Patrick said readily. They just wanted to see the scene anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was dumbfounded. Although they had switched some things, they were still the same. She just went from being on top to being on the bottom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just close your eyes. It'll be quick," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Valda Theller. 'Yeah, it's just five push-ups. I&rsquo;ll close my eyes and it&rsquo;ll soon be over.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she lay on the floor while Brian rested his palms on both sides of her shoulders. They were already so close before doing the push-ups. Now, their faces would touch at any time when he lowered his body later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a huge test!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's heart was now beating faster than when Brian kissed her before this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Here we go. Close your eyes." His voice rang softly in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller quickly closed her eyes. She heard the people around them shouting, "One... Two..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she listened to the countdown, she could feel Brian's face approaching even with her eyes closed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross looked at the scene in front of her with envy. 'Brian never did this to his previous girlfriends! He would never have done so! Does Brian really love Valda Theller that much?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as the crowd was about to shout &lsquo;five&rsquo;, the private room door was suddenly pushed open. Then there was the sound of arguing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Mack, this private room doesn't allow outsiders in. You can't go in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Outsiders? Am I an outsider? I'm here to see Patrick!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This voice...' Shocked, Valda Theller leaned her body forward to look at where the sound was coming from. However, Brian happened to lower his body at this moment, hence her lips instantly brushed across his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze. It was a brief kiss, but it happened. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I just kissed... him. We didn't kiss in the game, but it happened in such a situation!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Queenie Mack's voice then pulled her back from her trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Patrick, will you help me? You're the only one who can help me now!" Queenie Mack threw herself into Patrick's arms, looking pitiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, this..." The staff member who had stopped Queenie Mack now looked at Patrick for instructions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go out first," Patrick said to the club's staff member.</p></div>
