        <h1>Chapter 1488</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was utterly stiff, and her every movement made her seem like a robot. However, she kept trying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Standing on her tiptoes, she looked at the handsome face right in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They were so close that she could see his eyelashes. She could even see herself in his black pupils.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I just need to get a little closer and I can kiss him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'That way, he'll believe me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'He'll believe that I've forgiven him and I won't leave him! Does Jay know I love him and don&rsquo;t want to miss this chance of being together with him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was the man who loved her the most, and no one would love her as much as he did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The truth of that incident was indeed very painful to her that she had even hated him for a moment, but he had suffered too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she thought about it, she remembered how he had asked her several times before when they were together to forgive him if he did something wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Had he been dreading the day she would find out about the truth?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If only actions would prove it, then she would prove it...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stiffly stood on her tiptoes, bringing her lips closer to his little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His breath almost enveloped her, and his face was enlarged before her eyes. This only made her body grow stiffer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She closed her eyes and told herself that he would believe her if she kissed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would not misunderstand her if she kissed him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her heart beat faster and faster. She shuddered when her lips finally touched his. Then, she suddenly took a step back and covered her lips with a hand. She turned around, dashing to the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Blaargh... Blaargh..." Grace threw up at the sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She threw up almost everything she ate that morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a while, she finally stopped vomiting. She propped her arms weakly against the sink. Suddenly, as if realizing something, she turned her head and looked at Jason who was standing by the bathroom door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His tall body stood quietly by the door. His pale face and deep eyes were full of self-mockery as well as anguish. "Grace, you can't do it, after all. Your body can't lie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I&mdash;" She hurriedly wanted to explain, but he cut her short.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You only said you were willing to forgive me for the kids' sake, am I right? You don't want the kids to grow up in a broken family, so you're willing to forgive me! I know that, but... it would be nice if you&rsquo;re forgiving me because you have some love for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's not because of the kids. I'm willing to forgive you because I love you. Jay, I love you!" Grace exclaimed as she fought back against the discomfort of having just thrown up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?" His brows relaxed slightly and he looked down. "If you do love me, then stay here in the house and don't go anywhere. We still have decades..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If her love for him were really gone, he would make her fall in love with him again in these few decades!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll let the caregiver come in and take care of you." With that, Jason turned around and walked out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace bit her lip and could only smile wryly as she looked at Jason's back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He did not believe her at all.</p></div>
