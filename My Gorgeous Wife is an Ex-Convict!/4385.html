        <h1>Chapter 4383  Captured</h1>
        <div><p>Although Calvert didn&#x27;t quite understand what Harley meant, he would follow her words nonetheless.</p><p>After they ended their call, he started the car and sure enough, he saw Harley at the intersection.</p><p>As soon as Harley got in the car, she signaled Calvert to stay quiet. She then showed Calvert a message he had previously typed on his phone: Someone&#x27;s in your trunk. Don&#x27;t speak. Just keep driving.</p><p>Calvert was taken aback but didn&#x27;t say anything. He just continued to drive the car as Harley had instructed.</p><p>The car pulled up to the apartment complex where he lived. Harley asked Calvert to get out of the car and head towards the apartment, while she stayed in the back seat of the car, waiting cautiously.</p><p>Sure enough, not long after, the trunk was pushed open. A figure quietly emerged and followed behind Calvert.</p><p>Harley frowned. In theory, even if someone could track him home like this, it would still be difficult to get inside the apartment. After all, the electronic lock in the apartment required a password to enter.</p><p>If they didn&#x27;t know the password, then how were they supposed to get into the room?</p><p>The reason she didn&#x27;t call the police directly and chose to handle the situation this way was that she wanted to figure out exactly how the other party managed to get into the apartment.</p><p>Harley quietly followed behind, and soon, she figured out exactly how the other party had entered the apartment.</p><p>Password!</p><p>This woman knew the door lock&#x27;s code. And she could unlock it without making a sound, just like that, she silently walked into the room.</p><p>It seemed that where he lived wasn&#x27;t safe.</p><p>Harley was squatting outside, staring at the screen of his phone.</p><p>Once Calvert left, she turned on her phone, initiated a video call with her phone, and instructed Calvert to place his phone in a spot in his bedroom where it could capture as much of the room as possible.</p><p>Sure enough, after the woman entered the room, she began to cautiously explore the living room, looking around everywhere.</p><p>And following Harley&#x27;s instructions, Calvert placed the phone and then went into the bathroom.</p><p>The woman noticed the bathroom light was on, so she headed straight for the bedroom.</p><p>As a result, Harley quickly saw the figure of a woman through his phone&#x27;s camera.</p><p>The woman was rummaging through Calvert&#x27;s wardrobe, then she found Calvert&#x27;s personal belongings. She even stuck them on her face, looking utterly fascinated.</p><p>Harley instantly felt nauseous.</p><p>Just then, the door was gently opened. It was Calvert who had come to open the door for her.</p><p>&quot;Let&#x27;s go, that person is in your room.&quot; Harley waved his phone in his hand.</p><p>The two headed towards the bedroom. Once inside, they didn&#x27;t see the woman, but Harley knew that she had already undressed and was now nestled in Calvert&#x27;s bed.</p><p>Because earlier, she had already seen this scene on her phone.</p><p>That woman was planning to seduce Calvert.</p><p>Harley gave a signal, and Calvert, with a look of disgust, glanced at his bed. Then he stepped forward and directly pulled back the blanket.</p><p>&quot;Ahh!&quot; A woman&#x27;s sharp scream echoed through the room. All Calvert saw was a woman, clad only in her underwear, appearing on the bed.</p><p>&quot;Who are you? Why are you doing this?&quot; Calvert asked with disgust.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m your fan, I just like you, so I sneaked in here. I mean no harm, I just wanted to satisfy your physical needs. You don&#x27;t have to take any responsibility afterward, and I get to have intimate contact with the idol I adore. Isn&#x27;t that a win-win situation?&quot; the girl shamelessly said.</p></div>
