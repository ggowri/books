        <h1>Chapter 175</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how big a bimbo Maria Martin was, she knew that she had just committed a great offense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Since when did Grace get to know such a handsome and rich man?&rsquo; Jealousy rose within Maria Martin, but soon, she realized that the man looked rather familiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she had seen him somewhere before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Maria Martin&rsquo;s eyes lit up. She said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re... the pretty boy that belongs to Grace?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When that was said out loud, the manager&rsquo;s expression changed instantly. Mr. Grant nearly fell to the ground, wishing that he did not know such a woman like Maria Martin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nobody in the whole of Emerald City dared to say such a thing to Jason unless they were asking for a death wish!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smirked as he looked at Maria Martin, but his gaze was exceptionally cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Maria Martin, what nonsense are you spouting! This is the president of Reed Group, Jason!&rdquo; Mr. Grant anxiously explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maria Martin widened her eyes in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;This man... is Jason?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Impossible! Why would Jason be together with Grace? The person that Grace killed during that road traffic accident was Jason&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maria Martin recalled that before her family fell from grace, there was a time when Greg had bullied Grace at the clubhouse. The person that came to rescue Grace was Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, everyone thought that Greg had merely disturbed the tranquility of Jason, thus Grace was so fortunate to be rescued by Jason. Now when she thought about it... That was no coincidence at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maria Martin suddenly felt that her blood was flowing in a reverse direction. It was as if her blood was going to burst out of her veins. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But... But Grace...&rdquo; Maria Martin could not finish her sentence when her eyes met the icy gaze of Jason. She could not speak a word after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Horror rose in her heart, and her instincts told her that worse things would await her if she continued to blabber on!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Maria Martin, quickly apologize to Young Master Reed and this lady!&rdquo; Mr. Grant rushed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maria Martin looked so humiliated looking at Grace who remained muted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Apologizing to Grace would be like a slap on her face! However, she had no choice but to comply regardless of how unwilling she was. She had to comply because the man next to Grace was Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just when Maria Martin decided to let herself suffer a little and apologize, Jason plainly said, &ldquo;Then kneel to apologize.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Kneel?!&rsquo; Maria Martin&rsquo;s eyes widened as anger rose within her. &ldquo;You want me to kneel and apologize to her?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;So what? Do you think she does not deserve to receive your kneeling?&rdquo; Jason casually said. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you think. If I say that she deserves it, then she deserves it!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expression on Maria Martin&rsquo;s face kept changing while Mr. Grant kept pushing her to apologize. &ldquo;Maria Martin, quickly kneel and apologize. Since you&rsquo;re the one who did a mistake, then apologize sincerely!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was a problem... If she knelt here, everyone would be able to witness it. How was Maria Martin supposed to live with her head held up high from now on?! A fierce debate was going on within Maria Martin&rsquo;s heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Grace, she merely felt that whatever was happening right now was like a bad joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She saw that Maria Martin was about to kneel in front of her. She wanted to avoid it, but a pair of hands was pressing firmly on her shoulders, rendering her motionless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Sis, don&rsquo;t move. She wants to apologize, so let her do it properly,&rdquo; Jason whispered beside Grace&rsquo;s ear.</p></div>
