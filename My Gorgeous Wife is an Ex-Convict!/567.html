        <h1>Chapter 566</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even after so many years of looking for her, he never found her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more he missed that girl, the more he regretted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had drunk too much yesterday, and the regret that was suppressed in his heart was like a flood that burst its banks and drowned him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not even know how he got to the entrance of this restaurant. All he could think about was that he wanted to see her. He must see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if seeing her would make him feel better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, later, when he saw her, the girl in his memory kept on interlacing with her, who was in the real world. He ended up forgetting his manners.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a pity that even though he was drunk yesterday, he still remembered what he had done to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would not care if it were any other woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, with Grace, she was different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not because she was Jason's girlfriend, but just because she looked so much like the girl he imagined she would grow up to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she was not the little girl, he did not want to be disliked by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's no big deal. We're even," replied Grace lightly. She had also slapped him last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even... For some reason, Brian thought the words sounded a little harsh. "Don't you want to ask me what happened last night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," she answered. It was his business, and she did not want to be too curious. "I only hope that you&rsquo;ll not get drunk and do the same thing to me again, Mr. Hart. You and I can pretend that it never happened last night."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smirked in self-mockery. She was not even remotely interested in him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From the cashier's desk came the voice of the machine. "You have new orders."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was about to walk away when she knew that she had more delivery orders, but Brian grabbed her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned and turned to look at him. "Please let go, Mr. Hart!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you didn&rsquo;t know Jason, would you date me?" Suddenly, he wanted to know if it was possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace frowned even more. What kind of question was that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just want to know the answer. Why? Is such a hypothetical question so hard to answer? Or are you too embarrassed to say it's possible?" said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips together and said sternly, "No way! Even if I didn&rsquo;t know Jason, I wouldn't date you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her answer gave him a sudden stab in the heart. "Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because you have too many ex-girlfriends, I don't want to be one of them. Besides, you have someone in your heart. I don't want to be a substitute for anyone," answered Grace. She just wanted to be herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian immediately laughed at himself and let her go. "That's really... Something I can't argue with." His ex-girlfriends were all substitutes, after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked over to the cash register. A moment later, she hurried out of the small restaurant again with the orders to be delivered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian sat in his seat, turning the cup of tea in his hand without making a sound for a long time.</p></div>
