        <h1>Chapter 1816</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Only one week. Lina, all I'm asking for is another week," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said unhappily, "What on earth do you want? You've been dragging your feet on discussing the car compensation and you keep wanting me to give you time. When a week has passed, will you ask me to give you a few more weeks?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, a voice suddenly rang out and interrupted Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What are you two doing together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina instantly shuddered upon hearing the voice. 'It's... Dad's voice!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina turned her head around to see her father and mother standing not far away. They were looking at them with shock. Her mother was carrying a basket with many vegetables inside of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was obvious that her parents had just come home from grocery shopping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, were you with Hadwin Stephenson when you said you had to go out in the morning for something?" asked Mrs. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina blinked and did not know how to explain herself all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Tell me. What were the two of you doing together so early in the morning?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"..." &lsquo;Should I tell them?' Lina had a terrible headache now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Am I supposed to tell them Hadwin Stephenson accompanied me to a pregnancy check-up early in the morning?' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Mrs. Sweeney's expression changed as if she thought of something. Then, she leaned close to Mr. Sweeney's ear and whispered something. Mr. Sweeney's expression changed immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let's go home first! Hadwin Stephenson, you're coming with us!" said Mr. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was surprised. "Dad, you want him to come home with us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What else? He&rsquo;s already sent you to the entrance. Shouldn't you 'invite' him home?" Mr. Sweeney said the word &lsquo;invite&rsquo; through clenched teeth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina wanted to put up a fight but Hadwin Stephenson simply replied with one word, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do... Do you really want to come to my house?" Lina looked at Hadwin Stephenson in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Since Uncle has invited me, of course, I'll go," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The four people returned to the Sweeney family&rsquo;s house. Mr. Sweeney glared at Hadwin Stephenson with a look of distinct displeasure on his face. He was afraid that they would make a fool of themselves in front of the neighbors if they were outside, so he brought him home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Otherwise, Mr. Sweeney would probably rain curses down Hadwin Stephenson out there!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, explain yourself. Are you back together with this Stephenson boy?" asked Mr. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No!" Lina hastened to deny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, as soon as she finished talking, she saw her mother take out a bottle of folic acid and put it on the coffee table. "Then what's this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina stared at that bottle of folic acid, which was... among the pile of things Hadwin Stephenson had bought for her and delivered to her. She kept it all in her cabinet, but after seeing that folic acid could prevent fetal malformation, she took it out to consume.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had to take one tablet a day, so she would just leave it in the drawer after she was done taking it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Now it had appeared in her mother's hands.</p></div>
