        <h1>Chapter 2802</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching Valda Theller in a trance, the mother and son thought their threat had worked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, we won't say anything as long as you're willing to give us a house. We'll also say many good things about you when we meet your boyfriend, such as how filial you are and how you still remember your family after becoming successful..." Her aunt droned on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Family. My family's... long gone.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at her aunt and cousin with red eyes. "I don't need you to say good things about me. I told you I won't give you any money, not to mention a house."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago's expression changed, and Wynne's expression looked even fiercer as he thought he was losing his house. "Are you taking the hard way out? You won't give those things to us? Okay, I'll go to your boyfriend and show him the real you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a voice already rang when he had just finished speaking. "Who am I supposed to see?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago and Wynne instantly froze as they stared at the tall figure sauntering over. Wynne recognized at a glance that he was the crown prince of the entertainment industry&hellip; Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Y-Young Master Hart!" Wynne looked awkward. 'Why... Why is Brian here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How much did he hear?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had already walked over to Valda Theller and gently wrapped one arm around her shoulder. "Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared blankly at Brian with red eyes. For some reason, she suddenly felt like crying as she looked at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne quickly said, "What could&rsquo;ve happened to Valda? We're her family! Hello, Mr. Hart. I'm Valda's cousin, Wynne, and this is my mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne introduced himself with an obsequious expression. Rowena Santiago also had an obsequious smile on her face. It was as if she had seen the God of Wealth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda is lucky to have a boyfriend like you, Young Master Hart! Speaking of which, Valda's parents died when she was young. We worked very hard to raise her. I think of her as my own daughter." Rowena Santiago looked like she loved Valda Theller very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Others would probably think she was kind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Rowena Santiago rubbed her hands and said, "Well, Valda's cousin is getting married. They said they want a house of their own. Our family doesn't have enough money, so we&rsquo;re asking Valda to help us raise some money to buy a house for her cousin."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne added, "Mom, why would Valda refuse? She's my cousin. My friends and girlfriend know that Valda is Young Master Hart's girlfriend now. They said Valda is lucky, so I can also borrow some of her glory. Right, Valda?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne's speech was equivalent to forcing Valda Theller to agree. If Valda Theller did not want to have a falling out with them in front of Brian, she could only agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as Valda Theller agreed in front of Brian, they could find a way to take more advantage of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In their opinion, Valda Theller would not have a falling out with her family and risk losing her reputation in front of Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda Theller simply said, "No!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word made Rowena Santiago and Wynne freeze immediately.</p></div>
