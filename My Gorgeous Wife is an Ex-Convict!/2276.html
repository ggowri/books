        <h1>Chapter 2274</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The most important thing was that when she had just arrived, she saw her daughter sitting beside Martin Weiss's bed, staring at him blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If her daughter had no feelings for Martin Weiss, how could she have looked at him like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were struggle and obsession in the bottom of her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mothers knew best. Mrs. Corbyn knew that Martin Weiss would probably be imprinted in her heart forever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if her daughter kept saying she did not love him, she had feelings for him. She just... would not admit it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Mrs. Corbyn and Nelson left, Kyla remained in Martin Weiss's ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He slept soundly. The doctor said he would probably be asleep for a while even after the anesthesia wore off due to the severe blood loss. He could wake up a few hours later or maybe longer than that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When will he wake up?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face still looked pale with a sense of vulnerability.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was going to disappear at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's heart suddenly quivered. She raised her hand almost subconsciously and caressed his pale cheek as if to make sure that he was still alive and breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His cheek was so cold that she drew a gasp as soon as the palm of her hand touched it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so cold that... it was as if he was dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How much had he done and how much blood he had shed for her today?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The coldness made her heart ache in bouts like it was stabbed by a needle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if feeling the warmth of her palm, Martin Weiss's eyelashes quivered slightly as he moaned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze instantly as she watched Martin Weiss slowly open his eyes. She even forgot to withdraw her hand that was still on his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stared at the face before his eyes and felt the warmth on his cheek. He even thought he was dreaming. Otherwise, why was he seeing Kyla guarding his bedside and even watching him so intently?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would have desperately tried to distance herself from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next moment, he seemed to recall something when he saw the white gauze wrapped around her neck. He made a sudden attempt to sit up as a hoarse voice came out of his throat. "Is your neck okay? What did the doctor say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm alright." Kyla hurriedly pressed Martin Weiss down, preventing him from getting up. "Don't speak. You just underwent an operation. Lie down. I'll call the doctor." However, his hand seized her wrist when she tried to get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stiffened. She did not break free from the hand that was wrapped in gauze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He injured himself with a wooden stick and dagger with his own hands to protect her. How could she shake off his grip on her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated for a moment before suddenly leaning toward Martin Weiss. Their two bodies were getting closer and closer. Then, she used her other hand to press the nurse call button at the bedside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After pressing the bell, Kyla looked down and saw Martin Weiss on the bed. His eyes happened to meet hers too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Kyla's heart suddenly felt like it had skipped a beat. She was somehow at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two stared at each other. The silence was broken when the ward door was pushed open and the nurse came rushing in.</p></div>
