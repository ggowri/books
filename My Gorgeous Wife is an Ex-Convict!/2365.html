        <h1>Chapter 2363</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn finally smiled. The worry and fear in his eyes faded. "I like Mommy. I like Mommy the most..." He wanted to grow up faster. He could protect his mother, grandmother, and baby sibling when he grew up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was relieved to see her son smile again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, she went to the detention center to meet Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman looked resentfully at Kyla's bulging belly. She had lost her baby, but Kyla's baby was still alive and well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is it so unfair?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When I get out of prison, I won't let things be easy for you, Kyla!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well? When can I get out?" Jacqueline Bowman curled her lips and looked at Kyla confidently as if she was extremely sure that she could leave this place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've done my best, but the police have a record of this incident. There's no way you can be acquitted, so you'll only get probation at most," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? Probation?" Jacqueline Bowman frowned. "I&rsquo;ll still have a criminal record even if I get out on probation. Don't you know the difference between probation and acquittal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Getting probation is hard enough. Otherwise, you'll be getting three to ten years at the minimum. The Weiss family has found the best lawyer in L city to get you a life sentence. Jacqueline Bowman, there's nothing I can do if you insist on getting an acquittal. Let's act as if we never had a deal, then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman sneered coldly. "Haha, I thought you cared so much about your friends, but this is all there is to it? Poor Amber Mitchell is suffering now. She has no idea that the person she once considered a friend is doing nothing even when she has a chance to rescue her!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stopped, turned her head, and said, "Jacqueline Bowman, it's not that I don't want you to get acquitted. I just can't. Besides, I've separated from Martin Weiss. I even went to L city to ask Martin Weiss for this favor. I sacrificed all my dignity and pride for him to let you off. But just because he agrees to let you off doesn't mean the police will do the same. Your crime was reported all over tMason Swansonty. There's no way to erase your records!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was silent. She understood what Kyla said. She had thought about it before. It would be best if she could be acquitted. Otherwise, probation was the second-best thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Kyla had come and said immediately that she could be acquitted, she would certainly have some doubts. Now, her doubts were dispelled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... probation is fine. I just don't want to go to jail. When I'm free, I'll tell you where Amber Mitchell is!" Jacqueline Bowman said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope you keep your word," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I will as long as you keep yours!" Jacqueline Bowman sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyway, she would find a way to fly abroad as soon as she got out. Whether she told Kyla about Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s whereabouts was entirely up to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The move was quickly settled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla only packed some of the clothes she would usually wear, daily necessities, the maternity hospital bag she prepared, and some things the baby could use after they were born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was nothing else for her to bring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The movers that Martin Weiss sent to help Kyla easily took her things to Martin Weiss's upscale apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They said, "Mr. Weiss said he&rsquo;ll come over tonight."</p></div>
