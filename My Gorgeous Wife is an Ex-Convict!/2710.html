        <h1>Chapter 2708</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pursed his thin lips. He eventually did not shake off Kyla's hand but let her hold it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two of them walked, and Kyla used her phone to take photos of the scenery along the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, let's take a photo together," she said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that necessary?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she said. It would be a memory she could recall afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said nothing more, so Kyla found a passerby and asked them to take their photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Smile! One, two, three!" the passerby said as they took the photo. Then, they said regretfully, "Madam, your husband didn't smile. Do you want me to take another photo for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, it's fine. Thank you," said Kyla. She knew Martin Weiss would not smile even if they took another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking the phone back, Kyla looked at the photo taken on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the photo, she was beaming, while Martin Weiss was expressionless, ice-cold, and even seemingly impatient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyelashes quivered. Perhaps every minute and every second now were unpleasant for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let's continue walking." She smiled, put her phone away, took his hand, and walked on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the two reached a church, Martin Weiss froze. He remembered the church. Kyla and he had passed by the church and entered it back when they were dating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come on. Let's go in and check it out. I haven't been here for years. I miss it," muttered Kyla. Scenes of them being here recurred to her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was naive at the time, while he was hell-bent on revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they had not gotten together like that, there would not have been so many troubles in their lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pursed his thin lips but entered with Kyla anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not Sunday, but there were a lot of people. They understood why when they reached the church hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A couple was getting married here. They were getting married in the presence of a priest, and many relatives and friends of the couple were in the hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at the bride in the white wedding dress. A look of envy could not help appearing in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was young, she had hoped she could put on a wedding dress for the person she loved, but&hellip; she never wore one in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Perhaps I'll never have the chance to wear a wedding dress.' She laughed at herself before gently closing her eyes and clasping her hands together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes fell on Kyla. The sun fell on her through the window, making her look indescribably holy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her expression was earnest and devout as if she were praying for something important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After today, she would leave the mansion and divorce him officially!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he could make it through today, he would never have to see her and endure the uneasiness that rose in his heart from time to time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's what I expected! I should be happy!' Martin Weiss told himself, but a faint pang of pain seemed to come from his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, Kyla slowly opened her eyes. Her hands that were clasped in a praying motion were let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What did you pray for?" Martin Weiss asked.</p></div>
