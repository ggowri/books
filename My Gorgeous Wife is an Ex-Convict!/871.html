        <h1>Chapter 870</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she said this, there was a pause in her voice as if she was trying to recall something. However, her eyes did not look like the eyes of someone deep in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Elise Dean had prepared the speech in advance, then her speculation seemed more probable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she thought about this, she was suddenly pulled away by a man. He said, "Hey, why is an extra like you standing there? Get out of the way. Can't you see the camera? Don't just wander around!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked to find that she had just accidentally walked into the shooting scene of another film crew. She immediately apologized, saying, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who asked you here? Don&rsquo;t you know you can't wander around here? Besides&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before he could finish scolding her, another voice rang out. "She's not part of the crew."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately turned her head around and saw Brian who had somehow appeared behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crew member was shocked when Brian appeared. "Mister... Mr. Hart..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, go back to what you were doing," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crew member left immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Grace and asked, "What are you doing here?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"An actress here is a witness for my case, so I came over to ask for details," said Grace. Then, she tried to go around Brian to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he grabbed her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at him in confusion. "Is there something else, Mr. Hart?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pursed his thin lips slightly, his deep phoenix eyes staring at the woman in front of him. Her cheeks were a little red because of the sun while her long hair was simply tied in a ponytail. On her comely face, her calm almond-shaped eyes looked at him in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had... grabbed her subconsciously just now. It was as if he did not want her to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he was on the hill previously, he had already made up his mind not to have any feelings for this woman anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, why did he subconsciously grab her just now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, once he grabbed her, he did not want to let her go again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are your legs any better?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Much better," she said, twisting her wrist to pull her hand out of his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his fingers grabbed on so tightly that she could not break free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, let go!" Grace could not resist calling him by his full name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He just looked at her, his black eyes seemingly thinking of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Grace felt more and more eyes looking in their direction. After all, Brian was the crown prince of the entertainment industry and they were at a film studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone here could recognize Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If this went on, people would look at her like she was a panda! Just as Grace was about to speak again, Brian's voice rang first. "Do you love Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What kind of question is that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace glared at the man in front of her and said, "Whether I love him or not is my business, Mr. Hart!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Answer me." The face that was usually indifferent was now serious.</p></div>
