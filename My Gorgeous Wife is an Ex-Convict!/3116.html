        <h1>Chapter 3114</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, Valda took the initiative to ask about Brian's situation, which may be a turning point for their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She only hopes that Valda can truly come to her own understanding and have a happy ending with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She also believes that Brian is the man who can make Valda happy and protect her from all storms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the hospital room, Valda held onto Brian and felt as if she was enveloped in his breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His warmth, even through her clothes, spread to her cheeks, making her nose feel sour and wanting to cry even more...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Brian's body stiffened, and he nervously looked at the person who had been holding onto him, burying her face in his waist, "Valda, are you...crying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda didn't answer him, but her hands held onto him even tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he felt that area becoming even more damp...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those were her tears, right!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, don't cry. If there's anything bothering you, just tell me. No matter what trouble it is, I'll help you solve it," he said, his voice carrying a hint of pleading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As if he was willing to give everything just to make her stop crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda forcefully sniffled for a while before finally lifting her head slowly to look at Brian, "I'm...I'm sorry...Brian, I'm sorry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't need to apologize to me," he lifted his hand to wipe away her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her tears pained him deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But unfortunately, the more he wiped away her tears, the more they flowed from her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry...I'm sorry..." she kept apologizing desperately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened?" he asked in confusion. "Did Camille say something to you? I'll go talk to her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I asked Camille to tell me about what you were like when she saw you after I fell into the river before," she said through her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her tears seemed uncontrollable and kept flowing out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian remained silent, then leaned down and kissed away her tears. "It's all in the past now. You don't need to apologize to me. It's actually me who should apologize. I promised to protect you, but I failed to do so. I should be the one saying sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her tears were kissed away, and she stared at the face in front of her that was so close. "I...never thought you would be in so much pain..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, now you know. So please don't let me suffer anymore in the future, okay?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She choked up, but that one word "okay" seemed to be stuck in her throat and she couldn't say it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Saying "okay" was easy, but could she really keep her promise? When she was with him and he was being ridiculed and made fun of by others, could she really make him not suffer?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or will she become a source of pain for him again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her silence made his eyes dim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is he still too impatient? Impatiently wanting her commitment!</p></div>
