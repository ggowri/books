        <h1>Chapter 3657</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper ignored the people around her and looked at Roger, continuing her previous question, "Can we talk alone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger lifted the corner of his lips, seemingly with a hint of sarcasm, "Why should I talk to you alone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I have a lot of questions to ask you," Jasper said, "and a lot of things to say to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sarcasm on Roger's face became even stronger. "The word 'alone' easily gives people ambiguous thoughts. What if your boyfriend misunderstands? That wouldn't be good."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He won't misunderstand," Jasper said with a tone of unwavering trust in William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, her trust was a kind of stimulation for Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He put down his glass and stood up, and suddenly, the two of them were very close.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper felt uncomfortable and wanted to step back, but Roger's hand suddenly grabbed her waist, stopping her from moving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lowered his head, his handsome face enlarged in front of her eyes. His slightly alcoholic breath sprayed on her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With his thin lips slightly open, he whispered, "Why don't you dump William and date me instead? That way, I'll have plenty of time to 'chat' with you alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His tone was frivolous, even with a hint of teasing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's face suddenly turned red, almost unable to believe that these words came from him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you so surprised? Didn't you want to chat with me alone? I just offered a way that I can accept for you to choose!" Roger chuckled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't joke like this!" Jasper said displeased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not joking, I'm serious. You're only dating William because of the situation. If you date me, you'll find that I'm much better than William." He said, leaning his head closer to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His black eyes seemed to have some kind of magic, tempting people. And his lips were getting closer and closer to hers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other boys and girls who were cheering on the side became quiet, all looking at Roger and Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the two of them stood so close, their noses almost touching, their lips almost touching, just like a scene from a drama.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, a crisp slap interrupted many people's thoughts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger's cheek turned to the side, and Jasper breathed heavily, feeling a pain in her hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew that the slap she just gave was definitely not light.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not dating William because of the situation! And even if you hate me, please don't use this kind of way to humiliate me. If you only treat feelings as a tool for dating, then one day, you will also reap what you sow!" Jasper said angrily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger slowly turned his head and his gaze fell back on Jasper's face. "Wasn't it you, Miss. Reed, who first used emotions as a tool?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's face turned pale and he was speechless for a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If Miss. Reed is not willing to accept my proposal just now, then please leave," Roger said. "I still have to drink with my friends, and I'm afraid I don't have time to entertain you, Miss."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He said, then sat back on the sofa, picked up his glass, and clinked glasses with several men and women around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper stood aside, watching this scene, feeling a sourness in his nose.</span></p></div>
