        <h1>Chapter 909</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had made an oath to never let anyone from the Corbyn family hurt him! However, how did she hurt him so much with a few words?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll find out with a DNA test." Martin Weiss suppressed the pain in his heart without a trace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No. He's not yours!" Kyla said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not up to you to decide whether he is. If he's my son, it's only natural for him to acknowledge his biological family and return to the Weiss family!" Martin Weiss said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla immediately turned paler as a shrill "No!" escaped her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice was so piercing that Martin Weiss was a little stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's a child you don't want. Why do you want him to return to the Weiss family? No one in the Weiss family ever expected him!" Kyla said angrily. Nelson was her everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My blood runs through him. I don&rsquo;t intend to let my child stray," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was suddenly silent as her thin body trembled. There was something desperate in her pale face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, his heart seemed to ache even more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you want him to be Paisley Daniels's child? Do you want to take him away from me?" she said in a broken voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His brows were furrowed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had not thought of that at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't let Nelson call that woman &lsquo;Mommy&rsquo;. Martin Weiss, you can forget about letting my son be that woman's son!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Paisley Daniels set me up while he made matters worse by believing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If it were not for them, I wouldn&rsquo;t have ended up in prison! I've spent my best years in prison because of them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How can I let Nelson return to the Weiss family and stay with that woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Besides, how can someone like Paisley Daniels treat Nelson sincerely?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words seemed to anger him, and he snorted coldly. "Forget about it? Kyla, who are you to say that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm Nelson's mother. You tell me." She was still trembling, and her face was ashen. Her hands were clenched into fists as if to control the fear in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would do anything for her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? Then I'll make sure you no longer have the right to do so! Nelson is returning to the Weiss family. As for you, you won't even have the right to see him anymore!" Martin Weiss said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla staggered a little. She was tottering as if she had stepped on the edge of a precipice and the slightest mistake would shatter her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were looking blankly at the man in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this man who I once loved so much going to drive me to such desperation?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, why did I fall in love with a man like you?" she murmured. Was she regretting it or was she disappointed? Perhaps she found it funny?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Falling in love with him was probably the biggest mistake of her life!</p></div>
