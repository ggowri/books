        <h1>Chapter 130</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was because... it had always been just a game, a game between the rich and the poor.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was he going to tell her his true identity and announce the end of this game when she was discharged from the hospital?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, her calmness made the fear in Jason's heart more intense. She was clearly standing in front of him, but he felt that the two of them were so far apart.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you Jason?" She asked him for the second time. She was still so calm, as if she was simply seeking an answer.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His thin lips were tightly pursed. His deep amorous eyes met her clear almond eyes. After a long while, he finally opened his mouth and uttered one word, "Yes".</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's heart filled with bitterness. Indeed, this man was really Jason. Actually, she had been quite certain before, but... she had not given up. She still wanted to hear him say it in person.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay, I understand." She gently lowered her eyes, bent to pick up the fallen phone, then turned and pulled the glass door to leave.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, a hand grabbed her arm. His other hand pressed against the glass door, trapping her in between him and it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What do you understand?" he asked as he lowered his head to look at her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I know that you are Jason, and I know that this is just a game," Grace said calmly, "Mr. Reed, don't worry, I know what I should do. If this is your revenge, then I think... in the past days, you would have realized that whatever I have to lose, has already been lost. There is nothing left for you to take revenge on."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He couldn't help but narrow his eyes. Revenge... did this woman think that he was taking revenge? Taking revenge for Jennifer Atkinson?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jennifer Atkinson wasn't worthy enough to make him do these things.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, the calmer she was, the angrier he became. Why was he so afraid, afraid of her composure, afraid that she would leave?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He could not even tell whether he was annoyed with her or himself.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"As you said, what do you have for me to take revenge on?" he said coldly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She smiled bitterly. Indeed, to speak about revenge was to overestimate herself. In fact, he didn't have to lower himself like this. He could find someone else to do the work, like it had been when she was in prison.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She believed that there would be many people who would be willing to give her a hard time in order to curry favor with him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed, could you please let me pass? I... I want to go back to the ward first and pack my things," she said. At this moment, at such a close proximity, his breath was circling around the tip of her nose, making her feel uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I haven't allowed you to leave the hospital," he said. He bent down slightly, and his face got closer to hers. His deep and beautiful eyes looked at her pale face. "Also, since you called me 'Jay' before, you will continue to call me that."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed, I don't think it's necessary to continue this game. I don't think there's any need for me to continue staying in the hospital."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jay... this form of address was like an insult. It reminded her of just how little she had.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had thought that from now on, she could have a younger brother to accompany her. However, she did not know that the person accompanying her was the one person she should avoid!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A game, huh... Jason glared at the woman in front of him. Even though it had indeed begun as a game for him, after a while, it had ceased to be.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you really think this is a game, then it's up to me to decide when it ends." He closed his eyes, his cheeks lightly touching her cheek, his skin gently rubbing against hers as if they were inexhaustibly intimate.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's body was still stiff. His aura was so warm, but she felt very cold.</p></div>
