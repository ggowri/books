        <h1>Chapter 1713</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said, "What's the matter? Are you going to continue to make a fool of yourself? I can tell you with certainty that I never told the director to dismiss you, nor did I stop others from hiring you. I'm not that powerful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Holly Greer shouted, "You're not powerful, but Hadwin Stephenson is! It's you! You asked Hadwin Stephenson to get back at me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's expression sank as she stared at Holly Greer and sneered. "If I'm that powerful, how do you think I'm going to pay you back for that slap you gave me and what you just said to me? Since Hadwin Stephenson will help me do whatever I want, it's a piece of cake if I want to make sure you can no longer stay in Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As soon as she said this, Holly Greer's face turned pale with fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina turned to Anthony Sherman and said, "Yulai, let her go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Only then did Anthony Sherman let go of Holly Greer's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Holly Greer was no longer as aggressive as before and became a little nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina also ignored Holly Greer and said to Anthony Sherman, "Let's go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman nodded but asked nervously, "Aren't you afraid she'll give you trouble again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If she&rsquo;s afraid of Hadwin Stephenson, she won&rsquo;t bother me anymore," said Lina. Next to her was the escalator, which was almost empty right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina and Anthony Sherman were walking toward the escalator, intending to go downstairs. Suddenly, a force suddenly pushed her from behind her and she staggered toward the escalator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina!" shouted Anthony Sherman as he reached out to grab Lina's hand, but another person acted quicker than him and caught Lina first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Due to gravity, Lina took the man down the escalator with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All Anthony Sherman heard was the loud crash of someone falling to the floor. Then, he heard the startled voices of passersby around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman quickly crouched down beside the escalator and pressed the emergency stop button, making the escalator halt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was only a few seconds but Lina felt as though it had been a century.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Instead of being in pain, she only felt a pair of arms tightly hugging her. She was leaning against a broad chest. The person hugging her had taken the brunt of the fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The person&rsquo;s scent immediately told her who it was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was Hadwin Stephenson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though Lina did not see Hadwin Stephenson's face, she was sure that the person hugging her was Hadwin Stephenson! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The escalator... stopped!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Did you hurt yourself?" The familiar yet strange voice rang out from above her head.</p></div>
