        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason&rsquo;s body tensed slightly but he did not resist. He lay his head on her shoulder and felt her smell enveloping him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her scent with its faint fragrance inexplicably gave him a feeling of contentment.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was as if being by her side allowed him to relax completely.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jay, didn't you say that you would never abandon me? I vow the same, I will never abandon you. No matter what happens in the future, I will stay by your side."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her voice was a whisper in his ear.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Would you really stay by my side no matter what happened?" he mumbled.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Of course," she replied matter-of-factly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Won't you be scared of me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She chuckled lightly. "Why would I be scared of you? My Jay&hellip;&rdquo; She leaned back to smile at him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">My Jay... there she went again with that wording. Like he belonged to her. Oh, he wasn&rsquo;t averse to hearing it. He might even be happy about it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But right now he was thinking too much and when he raised his head suddenly their faces were only inches apart. The tips of their noses were almost touching.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And he stopped thinking entirely.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her face flushed red, and when she instinctively backed up, he looped his arm around her waist, stopping her from moving away.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace froze. It felt like all the blood in her body was rushing to her head. When Jay was this close to her, she felt lightheaded.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The arm wrapped around her was strong. She could feel the thick muscles that he held in check.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His eyes were nearly black, the pupils were blown out making her wonder what could affect a man like this.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Surely not her, with her scars, baggage, and worthlessness. But in his arms, she didn&rsquo;t feel so insignificant. She felt seen.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As something more than an ex-con.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As a human.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As a &hellip; woman.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She stayed there, suspended in his arms as her gaze darted between his eyes and mouth.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Still see me as your brother?&rdquo; Jay whispered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">No. There was nothing brotherly about him at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His big body was strong and he cradled her like she was something precious.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And his face. When his dark eyes crinkled at the corners and his mouth turned up in a knowing grin, she realized that he saw straight through her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was attracted to him. The way a woman wanted a man.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And he saw it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason&rsquo;s phone rang and the moment was shattered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Or maybe she&rsquo;d been saved by the bell, so to speak.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace wasn&rsquo;t sure how she felt about the whole &lsquo;near kiss&rsquo; moment with him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Part of her thought she&rsquo;d cooked up the intimate embrace and that she was reading too much into it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other half of her felt&hellip; alive. Like her mind and body were coming back to life after years of being dormant.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was probably just his good looks. He was so attractive that she&rsquo;d have to be dead to not respond to him in some way.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, please sweep the rubbish next to the garbage can. The garbage truck is coming in a while," Claire said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And just like that, she was jolted from the memory. "All right," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She caught a glimpse of Chase coming into the center and she shot a quick glance at her friend. Nice of Claire to take her out of Chase&rsquo;s path. For a while, she wasn&rsquo;t sure if Claire was going to</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">respect her decision or if she was going to keep trying to convince Grace to give Chase a chance.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was a nice enough man.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But&hellip; he deserved better than her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">So did Jay for that matter.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace frowned.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She cherished his friendship. She tried to imagine her apartment without him in it. If she came home one day and he wasn&rsquo;t there.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It sent a pang through her chest.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">More of her coworkers were gossiping about the Stevens ad drama. She meant what she&rsquo;d said to Jay, she didn&rsquo;t care one way or the other about him. If she still had feelings for Sean maybe she would&rsquo;ve enjoyed seeing him embarrassed. It was nice, don&rsquo;t get her wrong, it made her believe that maybe karma did work. But if she subscribed to all of that then she&rsquo;d have to think that she&rsquo;d done something to earn all the turmoil and pain she&rsquo;d experienced.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It&rsquo;s okay. You&rsquo;re okay.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Today is a new day.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She walked to the garbage can and started to sweep the surrounding area.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, a pair of Dior high heels came into Grace's view.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had once seen plenty of luxury brands and was aware that these particular shoes cost more than she&rsquo;d make in several months.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She then lifted her head and Lily's beautiful face came into sight.</p></div>
