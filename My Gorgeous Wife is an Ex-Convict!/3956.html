        <h1>Chapter 3954</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy couldn't help but admire the beautiful scene of the handsome couple being together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the meal, Jasper and William left first. Before leaving, Jasper didn't forget to tell Nancy to keep in touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Mick asked, "What do you think of William?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's great," Nancy replied smoothly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So you were staring at him during the meal?" Mick's jealousy was evident in his words, even though he didn't realize it himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ahem! Ahem..." Nancy was really choked by her own saliva this time. Her words sounded a bit strange. "I was looking at him because..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you like his appearance?" Mick casually asked, but his dark eyes were fixed on Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... I just think he and your sister make a good match. It's definitely not because I like his appearance." Nancy quickly explained. She only appreciated their good looks, as who wouldn't?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Mick's voice rose slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I only like your appearance," Nancy said with a thick skin. She felt like her words were full of flattery, but she didn't want Mick to misunderstand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just my appearance?" His expression was ambiguous, but his tone seemed to have softened a bit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course there are other things!" She began to rack her brain, "Like how capable you are at work, how good you are at games, and... um, how kind you are. When we didn't know each other well, you helped me so many times."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Kind?" His eyes flickered slightly, "You're probably the first person to call me kind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy immediately thought of the evaluations of Mick from the outside world, "No matter what others say about you, at least to me, you are kind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She said this very seriously, with clear eyes that didn't waver.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was precisely because of his kindness towards her that... many times, she felt even more despicable, using his goodwill towards her and his fondness for her to achieve her goals.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if she didn't rely on his help, with her own abilities, she probably wouldn't be able to bring Clarissa to justice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick's lips curled up, this time he was really smiling, obviously her words made him feel good.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about you, do you like me a little?" Nancy couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe a little." Mick said, although he wasn't quite sure what it meant to like someone, being with her didn't make him feel impatient.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He even felt that having her around was nice, she was interesting. When they first met, he thought she was cold, but when they got to know each other, he felt that she was actually warm at heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Ice and fire, shy yet bold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like a contradictory existence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made him even more curious.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What kind of woman is she!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe a little..." Although Nancy was a bit disappointed with this answer, at least it showed that Mick had some feelings for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I do this?" She took the initiative to stand on her tiptoes, wrapped her arms around his neck, and pressed her lips against his.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick's eyes gradually became deep, but he didn't push Nancy away.</span></p></div>
