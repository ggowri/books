        <h1>Chapter 1547</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He looked away a little uncomfortably and straightened up. "It's fine." With that said, Jason took his son's hand and headed outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned. 'What does he mean by &lsquo;it's fine&rsquo;? Does that mean I can still do it? Is he... not against me touching his head?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Does that mean he has feelings for me too? Does he like me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Maybe it would not be as hard as she thought to make him fall in love with her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why are you here today?" asked Patrick as he smiled at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian said, "I just happened to be free, so I came over to kill some time. Maybe I'll have to leave Emerald City again in a few days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Leaving again?" Patrick was stunned. "You've only been back a few days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There's a new project overseas. Someone needs to take charge of it. I plan to go there," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Does your old man agree?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So what if he disagrees? I'll go if I want to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Patrick hesitated a little and said, "Brian, do you refuse to stay in Emerald City because of Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian's face instantly darkened. Even if it was just hearing her name, it caused him unbearable pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You don&rsquo;t have to be against staying in Emerald City if it&rsquo;s just because you think Grace died here. Grace isn't dead. She has returned to the Reed family," said Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian would find out in a few days even if he did not tell him. After all, the news that the mistress of the Reed family had returned to Emerald City had already spread in high society.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he guessed Brian had no idea about it yet, or he would not have said he was leaving Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sure enough, Brian was shocked after Patrick told him about it. His phoenix eyes widened, and he looked at Patrick in disbelief. "What... What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His voice trembled, and his body trembled even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Patrick advised, "I said, Grace has returned to the Reed family. It happened a few days ago. Jason may have lost his memories, but Grace is still Jason's rightful wife. Besides, Jason used to love Grace so much that it won't be long before Grace has Jason on a leash again. I think you should just get over that woman..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before he could finish, Brian had rushed out of Patrick's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Patrick looked at the empty chair and sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian had not gotten over Grace in these five years. No one knew what chaos awaited Emerald City now that Grace had returned from the dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's just a woman," he muttered. He did not find Grace beautiful, but Jason and Brian both loved the woman to death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Patrick was glad he had never loved someone so much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian drove in the direction of Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Grace's alive! She's alive! She's not dead!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He wanted to see her. He wanted to see her alive in front of him.</p></div>
