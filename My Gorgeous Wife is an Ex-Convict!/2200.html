        <h1>Chapter 2198</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson slowly opened his eyes, got up, and looked at his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers was all dressed up as she still wanted to leave the best impression of herself on others even when abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As long as his mother did not hurt Lina, he could satisfy everything she wanted. He could let her live a good life, keep a toyboy, or even indulge in a life of luxury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it seemed that his mother was always constantly testing his bottom line no matter how he tried to satisfy her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's icy gaze made the remaining sarcastic words Emily Flowers wanted to say get stuck in her throat. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why... are you looking at me like that?" Emily Flowers felt a sudden unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Does my son's sudden visit here mean... No, no. I did it so carefully that no one would find out about it. Even if they did find something, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to trace it back to me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I thought you and I could live in peace by letting you stay here, and I could take care of you until you died. But it seems I was too naive," Hadwin Stephenson said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His calm voice sounded as if it was void of any feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did you think I'd live a good life after you sent me abroad?" Emily Flowers suddenly sneered. "You humiliated me for a woman. I gave birth to you and put up with all kinds of hardships to raise you. Is this how you treat me? Do you think you're filial just because you gave me some money?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, money alone isn't enough for you. You want more than money. You want power and have others listen to you, do whatever you want, and shower you with flattery. You spent half your life groveling, so you can't wait to let everyone know that you're living a better life than anyone else. And you can now easily deal with those who once looked down on you, right?" said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers asked in reply, "What's wrong with that? I finally made you the patriarch of the Stephenson family. I deserve all these, but what about you? You sent me here just because of a woman!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "Yes, just because of a woman, but this woman matters more than my life! I told you not to lay a finger on her, but you did it anyway, didn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers's heart leaped. "What do you mean by that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do I need to speak more bluntly? Didn't you single-handedly cause Lina's difficult labor? You almost made me lose my wife and my daughter. You nearly made my life a living hell, and my own mother was the one who caused all this!" said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When all the evidence he had pointed to his mother, he only felt an unspeakable sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mom, do you see me as your son? Or have I always just been a pawn to you? My feelings don&rsquo;t matter to you, huh? All you want is a son you can manipulate, right? You knew that if something happened to Lina, I wouldn&rsquo;t be in the mood to do anything else. Then you'd be able to come back and take control of the Stephenson family. I'm nothing but a puppet to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson uttered Emily Flowers's original plan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Emily Flowers's expression finally changed. Her son must have found enough evidence to implicate her to say that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You made me do all this! I wouldn't have done it if you hadn't forced me here!" Emily Flowers said with a ghastly expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "I never forced you. You ask for too much. You're too greedy! I thought of letting you live in peace for the rest of your life since you're my mother, but now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Now what? Are you going to send your only mother to prison?"</p></div>
