        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On his lips, it's her temperature.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her movements made his last strand of reason break.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So indulged in her proactive enthusiasm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can this really be done? Can you believe she really loves him? Even without the memories of the past, she still fell in love with him again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And not just those pitiful people?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler slowly closed his eyes and let himself sink into this sweetness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A night of lingering love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Tina woke up the next day, she only saw Chandler already up, holding a small bottle in her hand and studying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina suddenly woke up. The bottle was the medicine Lornell gave her, and there was still leftover inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yesterday, after she drugged his red wine, she put the bottle into her pocket without much thought at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did the bottle roll out of her clothes pocket and be discovered by him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina sat up at the moment, the sheets wrapped around her body, and looked at Chandler with some fear, "Chandler, this..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it your thing? "Chandler slowly lifted his head and looked at Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gentle gaze was like the one they had before </span><span>signing</span><span> the divorce agreement, which he had always looked at her with before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he didn't have any suspicious or angry expressions, she became even more nervous, as if her heart was about to jump out of her throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is... "Tina unconsciously swallowed the sudden secretion of saliva in her throat. How should she answer him? Tell him truthfully, or conceal it with lies!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if lies are used, then one lie after another overlaps, and once the truth is known, what will he think?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Isn't she the most aware of the killing power of lies?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the beginning, Kit was like this, deceiving her with lies, making her think that the person she used to love was Kit, and when the lies were exposed, it wasn't just the two of them that hurt!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is what I want from someone else! "Tina said, as she had promised Lornell not to say his name, so Tina could only say," This is a medicine that can make you... excited. Yesterday I drugged your red wine, that's why you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina couldn't help but lower her head as she spoke, afraid to look at Chandler's expression at the moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afraid of seeing his angry expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, being drugged like this would make anyone angry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that right? I used to take the medicine, and that's also true. After all, the feeling is different from the pain when the insect attacks. I should have thought of it earlier. "Chandler's voice came faintly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's body trembled slightly and said, "I'm sorry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She apologized while thinking about what she should say to calm him down?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you say sorry to me now, it's no use! "He slowly stood up and walked step by step to the bedside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she didn't look up, she could feel his body pressing down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Out of the corner of her eye, she caught a glimpse of his hands propped up on both sides of her body, while his breath sprayed on her forehead: "Tina, even if you say sorry now, I can't turn back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I meant to do this on purpose. If you want to curse me, just curse me! "She closed her eyes </span><span>and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just the next moment, she felt his fingers pressing against her chin and lifting her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He probably didn't mean to hit her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was daydreaming, his lips had already pressed heavily against hers.</span></p></div>
