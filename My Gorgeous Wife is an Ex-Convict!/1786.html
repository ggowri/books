        <h1>Chapter 1784</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Anyone with some common sense can see from this report that you&rsquo;re pregnant. Unless the doctor you saw has no common sense," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina bit her lip with her teeth. Quite some time passed before she said, "What does it have to do with you whether I'm pregnant or not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're carrying my baby. Tell me how is it none of my business?" Hadwin Stephenson asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Maybe it's not yours!" she retorted instinctively. The words just slipped out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, the air in the private room seemed to freeze. Hadwin Stephenson's eyes darkened. "Then whose is it? Anthony Sherman's?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina only felt as if an invisible hand was strangling her throat. For a moment, she could not speak a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's gaze gave her a sense of danger. It seemed Anthony Sherman would be dead meat if she answered yes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's... It's not Anthony Sherman's." She finally managed to squeeze out those words after some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her pale face and the slight trembling of her body made him feel a pang in his heart. 'What's wrong with me? I almost lost my temper just now.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was obviously happy about her pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was probably because of her denial that his heart, which was excited after reading the report, suddenly felt like it had been splashed by a basin of cold water. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You have no appetite for these dishes, right? I'll have someone remove them and replace them with some dishes suitable for pregnant women." Hadwin Stephenson changed the topic and summoned the waiter over so he could order more dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is there anything you want to eat?" he asked her as he ordered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I don't have an appetite. You don't need to order anything," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even so, Hadwin Stephenson ordered many dishes, but they were all lighter food this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina kept her head down and ate in small mouthfuls. Fortunately, she did feel like throwing up this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was still holding the report, but his eyes were on Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She... is pregnant with my baby, our flesh and blood. A new life is growing in her belly.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had once hoped she would be pregnant with their baby, but he still had some concerns about the Stephenson family at that time. Therefore, he looked forward to her getting pregnant but was also afraid if she really did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After she was seriously injured, he was even glad that she had never gotten pregnant. Otherwise, if lost the baby after getting injured, he had no idea how sad she would be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although Lina hung her head low, she could feel Hadwin Stephenson's eyes looking at her. It made her feel like she was a panda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She never intended on letting Hadwin Stephenson find out about her pregnancy, but God had different plans. 'What does&hellip; Hadwin Stephenson think about it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was nervous. She finally looked up and said to Hadwin Stephenson, "Well... Can you give me back my report..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She stopped mid-sentence as the man in front of her was staring at her with red eyes. Tears were welled up in his dark eyes as though they would come bursting out any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She never knew that a man could be so attractive when his eyes were full of tears till it seemed they could fall at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She seemed unable to look away from him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she suddenly looked up, Hadwin Stephenson seemed a little awkward. He looked away and raised his hand to wipe his face. When he faced Lina again, there were no more tears in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll hold on to your report first," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina froze a little. "Who are you to hold on to it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm the father of your baby," he said.</p></div>
