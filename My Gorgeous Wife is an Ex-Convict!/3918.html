        <h1>Chapter 3916</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy tried to push Clarissa away, but she had been beaten before and was already weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now being choked by the other party, her breathing became more and more difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The weaker Nancy was, the more ruthless Clarissa became.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the midst of the pushing and shoving, Nancy's upper body had already been pushed out onto the balcony by Clarissa. If this continued, she would be pushed off the balcony entirely. Eileen, who was standing nearby, became anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Clarissa, let go quickly! You can't take Nancy's life no matter what!" Eileen rushed over, trying to pull Clarissa's hand away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Get out of here!" Clarissa pushed Eileen away in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eileen was originally standing by the edge of the balcony. When Clarissa pushed her, she stumbled backwards and couldn't steady herself. At that moment, the balcony railing behind her suddenly came loose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" Eileen's body fell straight down from the balcony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom!" Nancy caught a glimpse of her mother's falling body from the corner of her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pushed Clarissa with all her might, trying to grab her mother's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But it was too late!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't grab anything and could only watch as her mother fell from the balcony and landed heavily on a planter below.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The planter shattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The mixture of blood and soil from the planter became a glaring dark red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mom!" Nancy trembled all over, turned around and quickly ran down the stairs to where her mother had fallen!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, there was a pool of blood at the back of her mother's head, her face was pale, and her eyes were tightly closed, which made Nancy extremely frightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't dare to move her mother's body, but with trembling hands, she reached for her phone and searched for it on her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She needed to make a call and get 120 here quickly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mother was her only true relative, and she couldn't let anything happen to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was still a faint breath coming from her mother's nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She quickly dialed 120 and explained her mother's situation to the operator, giving her address.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she finished speaking, Nancy couldn't stop her tears from falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had complained about her mother before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She resented her mother for wanting an easier life and bringing her into the Schultz family, where she lived like a servant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had no dignity, all because the Schultz family took her in!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had wanted to leave the Schultz family with her mother many times, but her mother refused, so she left on her own when she could support herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to cut ties with the Schultz family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her mother stayed with the Schultz family, allowing Clarissa to boss her around and abuse her in front of Nancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had resented and hated her mother for it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she never thought her mother would fall off the balcony trying to save her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since her mother had always been so weak and had only watched her being tortured by Clarissa, why did she have to rush out and try to stop her this time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did she have to rush out?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did she have to stop Clarissa?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy kept asking herself over and over again, tears streaming down her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when she looked up, all she saw was Clarissa looking down with a cold, indifferent expression. There was no fear or worry on her face, only a sense of superiority.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The ambulance arrived quickly.</p></div>
