        <h1>Chapter 2466</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she met Herman Moss through George Gregory, but she did not expect Herman Moss to fall in love with her. He did not tell her about his feelings for her, so she had no idea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she would happily marry George Gregory, but she repeatedly faced suspicions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Gregory family looked down on her even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One time at the Gregory family's banquet, a relative of the Gregory family openly questioned how an ex-convict like her could dare to marry George Gregory in front of everyone. They said there were many socialites better than her in Deer City. Though she was the eldest heiress of the Mitchell family, she had a criminal record.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The relative even made assumptions about female inmates serving other men, suggesting that she might have done so too. Amber Mitchell had found it utterly ridiculous at the time. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she refuted that relative, she was besieged by the rest of the Gregory family's relatives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She argued with them without backing down, and they were silenced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not feel the joy of victory but a deep sense of loss. It was because George Gregory, the man who said he would love her with his life, never once spoke up for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She left the banquet and drank alone at a food stall when she happened to meet Herman. He had anxiously come looking for her after hearing about what happened at the banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her tears could not help pouring out at the sight of Herman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect Herman Moss to be the first person to look for her instead of George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wiped her tears in a panic. Seeing that she was drunk, he wanted to send her home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he sent her to the door of the Mitchell family&rsquo;s house, he ran into George Gregory who was waiting there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only then that she knew Herman Moss loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory fought with Herman that night, and George Gregory raped her that same night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory had said he loved her too much. She was disappointed in him, but she still could not let him go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe it was because he had once said... &lsquo;I, George Gregory, will love Amber Mitchell with all my life!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew she loved the man, so she did not want to break up just like this. If he could trust her, she could forgive and forget.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She found Herman Moss and said straightforwardly, "I don't love you. I love George."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know that. I didn't mean to ruin your relationship. I just didn't expect George to notice when I thought I had covered it up pretty well."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From then on, she distanced herself from him, but George was still suspicious and jealous even if she only ever met Herman Moss by chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They quarreled more and more, so Herman went to her one last time and said, "I'm going abroad. If I'm no longer in Deer City and disappear from your and George's world, you two won&rsquo;t have so many conflicts and arguments anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect them to get into a car accident when he was sending her home after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Herman protected her with his life. However, the man who said he would love her as if she were his own life allowed her to be sent to a mental hospital without doing anything. He did not even spare her a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the beginning, she thought she would die from being tortured in the hospital. She kept repeating that she was not mentally ill. She tried to escape from the hospital many times. She was filled with hope that he would save her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that did not happen... He never came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hope turned to despair, then it became extreme disappointment in the end.</p></div>
