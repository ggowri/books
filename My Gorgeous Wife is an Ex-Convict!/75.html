        <h1>Chapter 74</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Who says we can't afford to buy something? I can..." Lina was about to bite the bullet and just buy an outfit to vent her anger and make the staff stop looking down upon them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace held her back in time and said to the senior staff, "Can't we just have a look in the store?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You two have come to a store which is far out of your income range. You might be here to make trouble, and it is my job to protect the rights of the other guests in the store." The supervisor acted as if he was being reasonable.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace responded directly, "But you don't have any evidence against us. In fact, you are clearly discriminating against us for no good reason. By the way, what you just said?&rdquo; She held up her phone and waved it for good measure. &ldquo;I have already recorded it. I think this should work as a good piece of evidence for me to hand over to the management of the mall."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You..." The supervisor's face immediately turned red. He had never thought that the other party would record his words.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, that's enough,&rdquo; Zoe scolded. &ldquo;You are someone who sweeps the streets. Why would you come here to shop? Do you still miss the days when you got to wear this kind of thing?" Zoe said mockingly, "If you really want these clothes, then I can take pity on you and buy something for you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why? Can't a sanitation worker come here to look around and shop for clothes? Or does the Stevens Family think that sanitation workers are inferior to others? If the public knows that the Stevens Family looks at sanitation workers in this way, I'm not sure how they will feel about it."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace said her words in a neutral tone. She wasn&rsquo;t making a threat so much as stating a fact. Zoe&rsquo;s personal behavior was a reflection on the Stevens Family.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe sputtered but she didn&rsquo;t go so far as to refute what Grace said&mdash;probably because she knew Grace was right and she didn&rsquo;t have any argument.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe held her tongue. Only because if it really did leak, what she&rsquo;d said, and somehow it flowed out onto social media that she&rsquo;d said that sanitation workers were inferior, then she would probably get flamed to death on the internet before the end of tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And it wouldn't just be her, but the whole family too.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why do you have to be so serious?" Lily, who had been silent throughout, suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace barely masked her surprise. Lily was the last person she&rsquo;d expect to come to her defense.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily smiled coldly and went on, "Sanitation workers can certainly buy clothes here, but as with any store, if one isn&rsquo;t actually making purchases, they shouldn&rsquo;t loiter. That&rsquo;s an impediment to store owners. If you aren't going to buy anything, then don't interfere with other people's business.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">From the sparkle in her eye, Lily thought she&rsquo;d scored the last word, and, already she could see the store manager perking up like that bit about loitering was the key to proving his innocence.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But Grace wasn&rsquo;t ready to be thrown out just yet.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This one is fine." Grace directly pointed at a dress with a price tag of four million dollars. It was a one-of-kind couture gown and the designer&rsquo;s name was valued around the world. It was a true showpiece. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Miss Stevens just say that she wanted to buy a dress for me? Then let's just get this one."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe almost spat blood. She despised Grace Cummins. And she might have been being catty to say that she&rsquo;d buy Grace something. But she didn&rsquo;t mean it!!!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Miss Stevens, you're not going to go back on your words, are you?" Lina asked. She smiled and stepped closer to Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe's face turned even redder.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily said disdainfully, "It's not that Zoe can't afford to pay for the gown. It's just that buying something like this for a murderer is not worth it."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's face went as white as a sheet of paper. Lina stepped in front of her. "Who are you calling a murderer?&rdquo; Lina snarled.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why? Does she not even dare to admit that she killed my sister?" Lily stared straight at Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace pressed her lips together tightly. The scene of the car accident flashed across her mind again. If she had been a step slower at that time, she might have died in the explosion of the car crash as well!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I didn't." She met the other person's gaze and spat out these two words.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; Lily sneered. "The verdict has already been passed. Weren't you talking all high and mighty about some evidence just now? You have to realize that all the evidence back then pointed at you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's eyes watered. It was true. No matter how hard she tried to defend herself, all the evidence really did point at her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was obvious that she had been framed, but no one believed her except Lina .</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Lina, let's go," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She grabbed her friend and spun to walk them out of the store.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And she slammed directly into Sean who was on his way in.</p></div>
