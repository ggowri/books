        <h1>Chapter 1045</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You rejected Brian?" asked Sam as he looked at Grace in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately felt a little awkward. After all, Brian was right in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was struggling to answer, Sam continued to do her makeup, saying, "You're brave. It's the first time I've ever seen a woman rejecting Brian's advances."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You seem pleased that I was rejected?" Brian glanced sideways at Sam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I haven't seen this before. It's refreshing." Sam grinned. Although he was chatting, he did not stop his movements at all. When the car arrived at the gala's entrance, Grace's makeup and hairstyle were done!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't prepare a gown. You said you&rsquo;d prepare one," said Sam as he looked at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian handed Grace a bag containing the gown. "The gown is in the bag. It should be the right size. Get changed in the car. We'll get off first!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he asked everyone in the car to get down except for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace opened the bag and looked at the gown inside. Suddenly, her pupils shrank and her eyes seemed to sting a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... a purple gown, and the skirt was full of butterflies and flowers made of lace and crystals. This dress was just like what he told her&hellip; when they were little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said he would buy her a purple dress with lots of flowers...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes welled. He gave her a dress like this even though he did not know the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he had delivered her the dress he promised as a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Bryn... still gave me a purple dress in the end!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace finished changing into the gown, Brian was stunned the moment she opened the door and got out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The dress was originally a gift he wanted to give the little girl when he found her. However, when he found Stella, he did not give it to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had no idea why. Perhaps he thought it would shatter the fantasies he once had if he gave it away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he knew those fantasies were only wishful thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he bought Stella other purple dresses afterward. However, he did not give Stella any of the purple dresses he collected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace wanted to attend the charity gala and Sam said that he did not have the right gown on hand, he had someone bring over the gown from the closet without thinking twice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was willing to let her wear the gift he had never given Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, as she stood stunningly before him in the gown, he suddenly felt that his fantasy had come true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It&rsquo;s as if... the little girl I&rsquo;ve been fantasizing about has appeared in front of me, wearing the purple dress I promised to give her&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's so real... So real that I&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not help reaching out his hands and embracing the woman in front of him as if he was holding the unforgettable fantasy and longing deep within him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked but did not push away Brian's embrace. Perhaps it was because his embrace felt wary.</p></div>
