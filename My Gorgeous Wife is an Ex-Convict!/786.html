        <h1>Chapter 785</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I want to forget about him and this relationship from the bottom of my heart. From now on, I want to forget about the man named Jay. Emerald City only has Jason!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having made her wish, Grace slowly opened her eyes and looked at the burning candle before blowing the flame out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll cut the cake," she said as she cut three slices of cake and gave them to Lina, Hadwin, and herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Picking up the cake, Grace ate it mouthful by mouthful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cake... should be sweet, but it tasted so bitter in her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After eating the cake, Lina cleaned it up. She planned to stay, but Grace said, "You don't need to accompany me. I want to be alone and have a good rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina hesitated a little before saying, "Alright then. Have a good rest! I'll see you tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Grace nodded. Looking at her best friend's worried expression, she smiled again and said, "Lina, I'm fine."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This smile made Lina feel even more bitter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the hotel, Lina got into Hadwin's car with a frown on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Still worried about your friend?" asked Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can I not worry? She said she&rsquo;s alright, but how could she be alright? How could she be alright?" Lina was more dissatisfied with Jason as she thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even thought Jason was great. Now, she just wanted to slap herself hard!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take me to Reed Residence. I want to see Jason!" Lina said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now?" Hadwin raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, now! If it's inconvenient for you, I'll take a taxi myself," said Lina, about to open the door and get out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He grabbed her arm and said, "It's not inconvenient, but... are you mentally prepared for it? You're going to get justice for your friend and stand up for her, but you might offend Jason by doing so."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll just offend him. I'm only a small citizen. What&rsquo;s there to be afraid of?" Lina trembled with anger at the thought of Grace's forced smiles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin said nothing more and started his car, driving toward Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The night was dark. At Reed Residence's entrance, Lina banged the gate desperately and pressed the doorbell, shouting to the inside, "Come out! Ask Jason to come out! I want to ask him something!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how noisy or how loud she was, Jason did not come out. Instead, a group of Reed Residence's security guards came out, warning Lina that if she did not leave, they would report her to the police directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Hadwin pulled Lina into the car. "Do it some other day. If you really want to see Jason and say a few words for Grace, then I'll find you a chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned and stared somewhat blankly at the man in front of her. Suddenly, she came back to her senses. He had taken her here to see Jason. If Jason did show up and got his head bit off by her, then she would have offended Jason. However, what about him? He would have offended Jason too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to find me a chance to scold Jason? Have you ever thought that by doing this, you&rsquo;d be offending Jason too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what?" He chuckled. "I&rsquo;ve prepared myself for that by accompanying you here today."</p></div>
