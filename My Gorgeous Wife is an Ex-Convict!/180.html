        <h1>Chapter 179</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, someone knocked on the door to the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason effortlessly answered, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The door opened. It was the manager and a few waiters who were bringing in the dishes. Grace wanted to pull her hands back, but Jason held onto her hands firmly. He said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move. They&rsquo;re still so cold.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, the manager and waiters all had their gaze on the two pairs of interlocked hands. This caused Grace&rsquo;s face to heat up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason continued to warm Grace&rsquo;s hand as if there was nobody else in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Is... this really Young Master Reed? The legendary Young Master Reed who&rsquo;ll strip a woman off her clothes and throw her into the streets if she tried to seduce him on purpose?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s said that Young Master Reed has zero interest in women, yet right now, he is being so gentle toward such a... plain-looking woman!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This scene was too shocking to be true!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Luckily, the manager quickly got a hold of himself and cleared his throat. He hurried the waiters to place the dishes on the table and leave the room. He then carefully closed the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Manager, we aren&rsquo;t hallucinating, are we?&rdquo; someone whispered to the manager. &ldquo;Who is that lady?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager solemnly said, &ldquo;That lady might become this city&rsquo;s future owner.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Indeed, the woman chosen by Jason would be someone who could not be offended in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the private room, silence enveloped the space once again. After Jason made sure that Grace&rsquo;s hands were warm enough, she felt that her face had already melted from the heat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s eat while the food is still warm.&rdquo; Jason sat next to Grace and grabbed food for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was not fully focused on eating. Her periphery vision kept looking over at Jason. After some time, she plucked up the courage and asked once again, &ldquo;Um... Will you let the police release my relatives?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It looks like you sincerely wish that I will release your relatives.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was only doing this for her grandmother! Grace looked directly into Jason&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His black eyes carefully observed the person in front of him. She seemed to have thinned down even further. Her chin was now sharper. Her willow leaf-like brows curved downward, but her pair of almond eyes seemed to have become bigger. Her face was so small that he could cover it with a single palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, her gaze was filled with expectation and yearning. She looked like a small animal that would tug on anybody&rsquo;s heartstrings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never liked small animals. However, it seemed to be an exception whenever he faced her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand moved slightly and reached for the wine glass in front. He poured a cup of red wine. He then placed it in front of her and asked, &ldquo;How about drinking some wine?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Wine?&rdquo; She was puzzled as if she had not expected this request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s drink some wine. I want to see how you look when you drink.&rdquo; He smiled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was hesitant. Her alcohol tolerance was very low. There was a possibility that she would get completely drunk. If that happened, she would no longer be aware of what she was doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;How... How many glasses?&rdquo; she asked.</p></div>
