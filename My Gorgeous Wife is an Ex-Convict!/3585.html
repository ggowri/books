        <h1>Chapter 3583</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside the charity event, a middle-aged man in a car respectfully handed the hairpin he was holding to Roger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Young master, this is what you wanted."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You did well." Roger looked down at the hairpin in his hand. "Don't let anyone know that I asked you to take a picture of this hairpin."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I understand," the middle-aged man replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger slowly tightened his grip on the hairpin, holding onto it tightly in his palm, allowing the sharp edges of the gemstones on the hairpin to prick his skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even a butterfly that flies freely will eventually be held in his own hand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper never expected to meet Roger at the welfare institution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, her class organized a public welfare activity and connected with the welfare institution. Every week, students from her class took turns coming to the welfare institution to play the piano for the children there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, the school's teachers also encouraged them to use the music therapy methods they had learned to better help and uplift the children in the welfare home, making them more positive and happy about life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper quite enjoyed this kind of charity activity, and she already liked spending time with children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before coming to the welfare home, she even bought some small gifts to give to the children there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when she arrived at the welfare home, she didn't see many children around. Just as she was wondering about this, the welfare home's teacher explained to her, "Many of the children have gone to listen to the big brother play the piano."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Big brother?" Jasper was puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's also a student at your Stanford University and plays the piano very well. Every time he comes, the children love listening to him play," the teacher said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is he a student in our class?" Meave asked, who came with Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We'll know when we go and see," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they arrived at the room where the piano was being played, they saw Roger playing the piano, and many children sitting around him, seeming to enjoy listening to Roger's performance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The piece Roger played was not a well-known piano piece, but rather a song from an animated movie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, listen, it's actually the theme song from the cartoon she watched when she was a child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh my god, I can't believe Roger can still play this song," Meave whispered in Jasper's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper nodded, she hadn't expected it either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the Roger playing this song was different from what she usually saw. His face was adorned with a gentle smile, making him look much softer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And when the song ended, the children were still chattering about what song they wanted to hear next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, what they were talking about were songs from children's cartoons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, as if sensing their gaze, Roger turned his head and looked in the direction of Jasper and Meave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's body immediately stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What a coincidence to meet you here." Roger stood up and greeted them proactively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Absolutely, what a surprise!" Meave said, then nudged Jasper with her elbow. "Right, Jasper?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it's really a coincidence. I didn't expect you to play the piano for the children here," Jasper said, as it was completely different from Roger's usual image.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are many things you didn't expect," Roger said calmly.</p></div>
