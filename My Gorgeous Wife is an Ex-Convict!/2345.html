        <h1>Chapter 2343</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Chase Harper called her the next day, she said, "Chase, about that... I don't need you to help me take the pastries back anymore. I'm going back to Emerald City too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to go back too? When?" asked Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Probably in the next couple of days. I have to check the high-speed train schedule," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you join me tomorrow? You're pregnant. It's safer to have someone look after you. There are still seats on the carriage I booked. I can just switch seats with someone else," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla thought about it and agreed. After all, she should be careful now that she was pregnant. It was better to have someone she knew look out for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Kyla asked Chase Harper about his train ride and carriage before booking a ticket back to Emerald City tomorrow on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she called Mallory Malcom. "Mallory, I&rsquo;ll be returning to Emerald City tomorrow. Please help me check out of the hotel."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mallory Malcom froze. "Tomorrow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, tomorrow. There's no point in staying here any longer. I might as well return sooner. Thank you for all the help these days," she said politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she ended the call, she let out a little sigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it would be hard for her to meet Martin Weiss again after her departure. Maybe when she did get a chance to see him again years from now, he would already have someone new by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thought of it made her feel a clenching pain in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried hard to suppress the heartache and told herself that she had made this choice. She did it in hopes that he could live a good life and not risk his life for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He has now forgotten this relationship and no longer loves me. Is it not the best outcome?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He&rsquo;ll live a good life, so what do I have to regret?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I have nothing to regret!' she said to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mallory Malcom came to Martin Weiss's office and said, "Chairman Weiss, Miss Corbyn will return to Emerald City tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's hand jerked when he was reading the documents. He looked up at Mallory Malcom. "She's returning to Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Miss Corbyn just called and told me about it. She has already booked a ticket back," replied Mallory Malcom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face was cold as his fingers gripped the pen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She's... going back?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'So, has she given up begging me? Is she leaving my world so readily?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She disturbed his already peaceful mind when she came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that she had messed him up, she was leaving?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla... Why can't I shut her out of my mind?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His mind flashed back to the conversation he had with the hypnotist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can hypnosis make me forget my feelings for that person?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In principle, yes. As long as no one says the 'code word' you've chosen, it's impossible to recover your feelings. Unless you fall in love with her again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it true that only the code word can recover the memories? As long as I don't fall in love with her again and no one says the code word, I&rsquo;ll be indifferent to her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There&rsquo;s another exception, which is if you love her too deeply. In that case, there's a small chance your mind will dehypnotize itself. But the chances are so small that you have nothing to worry about."</p></div>
