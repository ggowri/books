        <h1>Chapter 3265</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're pregnant, why didn't you tell me? Were you planning to keep it a secret if I didn't come to your studio?" Camille said angrily to Valda in her studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not like I was intentionally keeping it from you. It's only been a little over a week since I found out, and because it's still early in the pregnancy and the fetus is not stable yet, I wanted to wait until it was more stable before telling anyone," Valda explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Camille's expression immediately turned nervous. "How is the fetus now? Is it stable?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"For now, it's okay. The blood test results have doubled, but we still need to check every week," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's good," Camille breathed a sigh of relief. "But now that you're pregnant, it's best to reduce your workload so you don't overwork yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew how much her friend wanted this child, so now that she was pregnant, it was natural to protect her and the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda also nodded. "I will try to finish the comic I'm currently serializing before I give birth, and after that, I plan to take a year off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," Camille readily agreed. "I'll go back and see how I can adjust your current serialization process for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing their work conversation, they started talking about the baby in Valda's belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're pregnant, how is Brian reacting?" Camille asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Be careful, and he talks a lot more now than before. I didn't know before that he could be so chatty," Valda chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, in her memory, he had always been a man of few words. However, after they started dating and their relationship improved, he did speak more, but not excessively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And until now, she only just found out that he too can be a bit of a complainer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille chuckled at the comment, "I'm actually looking forward to seeing what Brian will be like as a dad in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Valda imagined Brian holding a baby... Hmm, it seems like she's starting to look forward to it too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Valda had originally planned to wait until after the first three months had passed before telling her godmother and in-laws about her pregnancy, Brian took care of Valda's diet and daily life, and even had the butler hire a chef to make special dishes for pregnant women. He also accompanied Valda to prenatal check-ups and even placed some pregnancy-related books on the office desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could the old Mr. Hart and the old Mrs. Hart not have guessed it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So he went straight to his son's office, closed the door, and began to interrogate him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is Valda pregnant?" Mrs. Hart asked directly without beating around the bush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Brian replied readily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. and Mrs. Hart, who are elderly, exchanged a joyful glance with each other, both expressing happiness in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda is pregnant, which means they will have a grandchild! They have been envious of their old friends who already have a third generation, so this is exciting news for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although they didn't pressure their son to have a baby after getting married, they have always been longing for one deep down. And now... they finally see a glimmer of hope!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How long has it been?" asked Mrs. Hart again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's almost been 6 weeks," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"6 weeks? How is the fetus doing now?" asked Mrs. Hart anxiously, while Mr. Hart also looked on nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian, on the other hand, calmly said, "Everything is fine."</p></div>
