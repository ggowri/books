        <h1>Chapter 2313</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She instantly trembled as a tall figure came into view.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was thinner than she had last seen him in the hospital. The crisp suit and his cold face made her nose prickle and her eyes warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She realized how much she wanted to see him when she saw him again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not only because of Amber Mitchell but also because she... just wanted to see him. She wanted to see how he was healing from his injuries and how he was doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin..." she cried out, but her voice was so pitifully low that it could hardly be heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he heard it all the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been talking to someone who had walked out with him when he stopped suddenly and looked up at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When their eyes met, Kyla's heart trembled instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, she seemed to understand why Mallory Malcom said Martin Weiss had moved on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because the way he looked at her was frightfully unfamiliar as if she were a mere acquaintance to him and nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if their relationship in the past meant nothing to him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss then turned and said to the person beside him, "Go back first and give me the materials of today's meeting after you've sorted them out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if some wanted to watch the scene unfold, they dared not stay after their boss said so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd soon got into the elevator and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss slowly walked up to Kyla with indifferent eyes and an unchanging expression. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I remember telling Mallory that I don't want to see you." His cold voice pricked her eardrums like a steel needle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I want to see you about something important." She bit her lip slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "If you&rsquo;re facing any problems, you can ask Mallory to help you solve them. You don&rsquo;t need to come and see me. I'll let it pass this time, but I don't want this to happen again, Kyla. I'll ask Mallory to take you back to your hotel later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Martin Weiss turned around to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla put the glass in her hand on the small round table nearby almost subconsciously. Then, she quickly grabbed his arm. "Martin, since we've already seen each other anyway, why don't you let me finish what I have to say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glanced down at the hand gripping his arm before slowly moving his gaze to her face. Suddenly, he sneered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, you're still so full of yourself. You said you wanted us to be even, so be it. You said you didn't want me to ever show up in front of you again, so I stayed far away. You make all the decisions in our relationship. You now want to meet me, so you came. Do I have to listen to whatever you have to say just because you want to talk to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he raised his hand and pried her fingers off his arm one by one.</p></div>
