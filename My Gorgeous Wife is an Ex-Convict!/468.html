        <h1>Chapter 467</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold and Camelia Meyer were no longer acting superior as they had with Grace earlier today. Even though they had seen Grace as an ant that could easily be crushed, at this moment, they were the ants!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As an actress, Lily was the most capable of concealing her expression. With a look of guilt, she said, "Brother, my parents met Miss Cummins at the mall today. In a fit of pique, they did some drastic actions toward Miss Cummins. Therefore, we&rsquo;ve come here hoping to apologize to Miss Cummins in person and get her forgiveness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a bit difficult for Lily to call her &lsquo;Miss Cummins&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, this woman was the last woman she wanted to see. She had always considered her worthless, but now, she needed to address the person whom she considered worthless respectfully. She had to forcefully suppress her dignity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? In a fit of pique? Tell me, what is it about her that made you angry?" asked Jason calmly. His deep black eyes made it hard for them to guess what he was feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Temperamental&rsquo; was how people described Emerald City's local tyrant. Few people in Emerald City could guess what Jason was thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She&hellip; She's Jennifer's murderer, Jason! Isn't that enough to make us angry?" Camelia Meyer suddenly shouted, her voice full of resentment. "She&rsquo;s the one who killed Jennifer! How&hellip; How can you date her? Jennifer won't rest in peace if you do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the second half of the sentence came out of Camelia Meyer's mouth, Harold and Lily's faces immediately paled. They tried to stop Camelia Meyer, but it was already too late. Camelia Meyer had finished speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as they saw Jason's face darkening, their hearts stopped. They realized that they had made a mistake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold, in particular, was a wild old fox in business. He was better at reading people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man like Jason was free to be interested in any woman he wanted. Not to mention that he had not married Jennifer back then. Even if they had gotten married, the Atkinson family still did not have a right to comment on the woman he was interested in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, Jason stared at Camelia Meyer coldly. "Is it up to you to tell me who I can be with?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer trembled and immediately came back to her senses. What did she just say in a moment of desperation?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew she should not say this, but how could she come to terms with this? How could she come to terms with the fact that the person who killed her daughter was now with the man her daughter should have married? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gritting her teeth, Camelia Meyer once again said, "Jennifer loved you so much, Jason. Don't you care about her? If you really get together with a murderer like Grace, Jennifer will only become a joke in the eyes of others!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sneered. "That&rsquo;s enough. Stop calling her a murderer. She's not a murderer. Jennifer Atkinson's death has nothing to do with her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason finished, both Harold and Lily looked at him in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer yelled, "Nothing to do with her? The court found her guilty!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason turned to Harold who was beside Camelia Meyer. He had a half-smile on his face. "I&rsquo;ve already said that it has nothing to do with her, so it has nothing to do with her. Do you understand? I don't want to hear you call her a murderer anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold turned pale as his lips trembled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer looked like she wanted to say more, but Harold stopped her. "Sure, we understand. Why don't Young Master Reed ask Miss Cummins to come out for a moment so that we can apologize for what happened today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold, who had been doing business for many years, naturally knew when to yield.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the Atkinson family was also rich and powerful in Emerald City, they could not compete against an elite family like the Reed family. Harold thought about the incident, and a wave of mixed emotions swept over him.</p></div>
