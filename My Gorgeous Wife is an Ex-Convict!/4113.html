        <h1>Chapter 4111</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina nervously closed her mouth and frantically tried to think of an excuse to get out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Hadwin obviously didn't give his daughter time to come up with an excuse, and looked directly at Chandler, "Did you do something to Tina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler met Hadwin's gaze, "I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No...no, Chandler didn't do anything to me." Tina quickly interrupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin, who was rarely angry, shouted at his daughter, "I didn't ask you, I asked him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I did." Chandler gave a simple and straightforward answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air suddenly seemed to freeze, and Hadwin suddenly rushed forward, grabbing Chandler's collar, "Is this how you treat the Stephenson family's trust? I trusted you to be with Tina, she's only a few years old, and you're treating her like this. You're not even married yet! Have you thought about the consequences of this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina and Lina looked at Hadwin's angry expression, both dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But fortunately, they were mother and daughter, and their tacit understanding was enough. They both rushed forward without saying a word, one pulling her husband back, and the other squeezing in between her father and fianc&eacute;, trying hard to separate the two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Husband, calm down first, and figure out what's going on. Chandler is someone we've watched grow up, he's not that kind of person!" Lina helped her future son-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How can I calm down about something like this!" Hadwin said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He cherished his precious daughter, who was already 20 years old, but in his eyes, she was still a little girl. Even though she had been engaged to Chandler for many years, to Hadwin, it was just an engagement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> They hadn't even set a date for the wedding yet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But today, he suddenly discovered that his carefully nurtured daughter had been taken away by someone else without his knowledge. How could he not be angry?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just then, Tina shouted at her father, "Dad, you've got it all wrong. Yes, Chandler and I had sex, but I forced him to do it! He didn't want to, but I made him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The air froze once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin, who had been full of anger just a moment ago, almost couldn't catch his breath after hearing his daughter's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina, on the other hand, looked at her daughter with interest. "You took the initiative?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yeah." Although Tina was usually carefree, she blushed when talking about this kind of thing with her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You're my daughter after all. When you need to take the initiative, you should take it!" Lina patted her daughter's shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina was delighted. Her mother's words meant that she was being supported and that her mother was on her side!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Lina, how could you say that!" Hadwin was unhappy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You heard it yourself. It was Tina who took the initiative. Don't blame Chandler." Lina was still very satisfied with her future son-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "If a man refuses, how can a woman take the initiative? He could have refused!" Hadwin blamed Chandler for not refusing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In any case, it was all Chandler's fault!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And his precious daughter was just an innocent little white rabbit!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina was puzzled. Her usually steady husband was acting like a stubborn child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then why didn't you refuse my advances back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With Lina's shout, the room fell silent again.</p></div>
