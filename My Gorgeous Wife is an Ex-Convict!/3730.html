        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She spoke vaguely, as the explanation of her current situation with Mason, with whom she was trying to date, might sound a bit strange to outsiders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel felt a sense of disappointment rising in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he heard Veronica say that she had broken up with Mason, he felt a strange happiness that he couldn't explain, because he hoped that he could still hold a place in her heart after many years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That's why he felt disappointed when he heard the rest of her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...are together now?" he murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um, at least for now," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" Daniel asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked at him with confusion, clearly not understanding what he was asking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you two get together back then, and only recently started dating?" Daniel asked. Mason had used such means to break up with Veronica back then, but after many years, he was now dating her. It all seemed very strange to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica pursed her lips and said, "This is between him and me, senior, you don't need to ask too much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel suddenly realized that he might have crossed a line with his question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm just...worried about you," he said hesitantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm doing well now," Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel gave a bitter smile, realizing that the underlying meaning of her words was that he was now just an outsider and had no right to ask these questions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And you? This is just a part-time job, right?" Veronica asked. According to their age difference, Daniel should have already been working full-time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, part-time. I haven't found a suitable job yet, so I'm delivering food and sending out resumes at the same time," Daniel said. "The economy isn't doing well right now, and it's hard to find a job after graduation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, good luck. I have to go to work now, so I won't chat for long," Veronica said, heading towards the bus stop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, she walked towards the bus station sign.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica!" Watching Veronica's back as she left, Daniel couldn't help but speak up. "Have you...ever hated me over the years? Hated me for what I did back then..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," she said calmly. "I never hated you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, she lifted her foot again, and Daniel watched her disappearing figure, feeling a heavy and oppressive weight in his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She never hated him, but why did he feel that it was even harder to bear than if she had?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if he had no place in her heart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica didn't deliberately avoid thinking about her relationship with Daniel, but whenever she thought about it in the past, it was always in relation to Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, when Daniel asked her if she had ever hated him, she suddenly realized that she had never hated him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because their relationship was too short and shallow that she didn't even have the capacity to hate it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in reality, Daniel simply made a choice between his home and his relationship with her, and he chose his home, betraying her feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you thinking about?" A sudden cold voice sounded in Veronica's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was startled, only then realizing that Mason had appeared in her room without her noticing any sound.</span></p></div>
