        <h1>Chapter 1766</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two men looked at each other. Neither of them spoke, and for a moment, the atmosphere seemed to freeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Terrence hurried over and reported, "Young master Reed, we've sent Little Young Master Ci to the hospital. The doctor has already pumped his stomach. They suspect that Little Young Master Ci was fed some sleeping pills, but not too many. We still have to ask Lily for the details, though. Besides that, we've found Sean, but he's seriously injured."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In other words, were they going to save him or not?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, with the Stevens family's current capabilities, they had no extra money to save Sean. Furthermore, Sean was a kidnapper, so saving him was not worth it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said coldly, "Save him. I want Sean to live!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence froze and immediately understood what his boss meant. Little Young master Reed wanted Sean to live and stay in prison for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In that sense, perhaps death would be a relief for Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Terrence's phone rang. Terrence answered it, and his expression changed. "What? Did you say Little Young Lady is missing? How did she go missing? Aren't there so many people watching... Huh, you found her... Okay, got it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Moments later, Terrence ended the call. Under his boss' intense gaze, he quickly explained, "Well... The person looking after Little Young Lady reported that she evaded the surveillance cameras and sneaked out. She went missing for a while, but they quickly went searching for her. They&rsquo;ve found Little Young Lady now. She's safe and sound."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason snorted coldly. "How did they manage to let a five-year-old girl sneak out when there are so many people watching her? And they waited until they found her to report it? What's the matter? Were they going to keep it a secret if they never found her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence was dripping with cold sweat. He could almost foresee that even though they had found Little Young Lady this time, the people in charge of looking after Little Young Lady would definitely suffer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... "Well, Little Young Lady's disappearance and how she evaded the surveillance cameras probably have something to do with Little Young Master Mo," Terrence added carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mick will help Jasper because they&rsquo;re close. What's the matter? Is this enough reason for those people to escape punishment?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence could not help complaining in his head, 'Is Young master Reed... pushing the blame?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Now that Jasper has been found, get more people to watch over her. If anything happens to the kids again, tell those people to prepare for a miserable life ahead!" Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence quickly said, "But they also found Lily's son, William, with Little Young Lady. That kid... What are you going to do with him, Young master Reed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Lily's son?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason could not help frowning. 'How did Jasper end up with that kid after going missing?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper had quarreled with the child over the piano at the exhibition. He did not think much of it at the time, but if the kid was Lily's flesh and blood, then... "Let the police handle him. Just let the police handle it according to the standard procedures. Keep Jasper away from the kid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though it was just a child, he did not want to put his child in any possible danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," answered Terrence. Then, he picked up his phone again to inform his subordinates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes fell on Brian not far away. He suddenly asked, "Why did you just happen to be there today?"</p></div>
