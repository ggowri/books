        <h1>Chapter 503</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was dating him now, so to speak. Therefore, if she was involved in any scandal with other men, it would be humiliating for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not think of the trouble he was causing her by making their relationship public today. When the time came for them to break up, perhaps the only thing she could do is to change her job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina immediately laughed at herself. In the end, he was still &lsquo;getting even&rsquo; with her. The more miserable she was, the happier he would be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, I see. I don&rsquo;t think anyone else will think that I&rsquo;m after their boyfriends anymore,&rdquo; said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin frowned a little. The way she was speaking somehow made him feel uncomfortable. It was as if she was emitting an invisible sense of alienation from her body, stretching the distance between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't like it?" asked Hadwin, squinting his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, you're my boyfriend, and it's the right thing to do," Lina replied with a smile. "What you did today embarrassed Hattie Robson and Taylor Carline in front of everyone, which is a relief to me, so that's quite nice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, why did he feel as if she did not mean what she said? Did she know that he did that today just to claim her under his wings in front of outsiders? It was so that she would not be easily bullied in his absence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Hadwin took Lina into his arms. His face came close to hers, and his voice whispered in her ear, "When will you fall in love with me, Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's body stiffened a little. Falling in love with him meant the end of their current relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Soon,' she said to herself. Soon, she would act as if she had fallen in love with him, and then... She would pretend she was falling a little more in love with him each day until he &lsquo;dumped&rsquo; her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace later called Lina to ask how the police were handling the situation and whether she needed help. Lina said, "It's all right, it has been settled. Plus, my two colleagues have both apologized to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They apologized?" Grace was a little surprised. The woman she saw the other day, Hattie Robson, seemed determined not to give up until Lina was found guilty. She apologized so soon?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin came to my office," Lina said succinctly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace understood what had happened after hearing about Hadwin&rsquo;s involvement in the matter. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was relieved that her best friend was all right. After she ended the call, she went online and was shocked when she saw the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The news reported the demolition of a shopping mall, and it was expected to take a month. However, the problem was that the mall was only ten years old. It was rare for a mall that had only been built a couple of years to be demolished. Besides, the mall usually had a lot of customers, so the reason it was getting demolished was a mystery. The news of this prompted much speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The official answer from the mall was simply that there were other purposes for the site.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What surprised Grace was that it was the same mall from which Lily's parents had kicked her out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What the hell was going on? Could it be a coincidence, or...</p></div>
