        <h1>Chapter 2361</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at the unit that was more than 300 square meters in front of her. It had exquisite furnishing, and everything was new. It looked just like those sample houses. It had everything it should have, maybe except a breath of life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla replied to Martin Weiss, "Okay, I'll think about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Also, move here in a couple of days. I'll send someone over to help you move your things," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In a couple of days?" She was shocked. "So soon?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He asked in reply, "Is it too soon? How long do you wish to delay it? Kyla, you were so eager to get me to agree to your request, yet you&rsquo;re saying it's too soon when I&rsquo;m asking you to carry out our deal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was speechless. Flustered, she looked at the person in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The look in her eyes softened his heart. He pressed his thin lips together and said, "I&rsquo;ll try my best to do what I promised you. Similarly, I expect you to do your best to keep your promise to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay... I'll live with you like a normal married couple, but..." She bit her lip slightly and said awkwardly, "I'm not physically capable of fulfilling marital duties for now... I hope you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you think I'm going to want you?" Martin Weiss suddenly sneered. "Do you think I would be interested in a pregnant woman or a woman who just gave birth? How charming do you think you are to tempt me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla blushed suddenly. His words seemed to be telling her not to flatter herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked down. 'Yeah, how could he want me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me take you home," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they reached the store&rsquo;s entrance, Martin Weiss said, "Kyla, I hope you'll play the role of a good wife for more than a year. I'll set you free once the time is up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would be setting himself free at the same time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyelashes quivered a little. When she heard him say he would set her free, her heart instantly ached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She... had never been free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it. I'll be a good wife," she said. Not for the agreement but because it was their last moments together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could savor this memory when she got old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She closed the car door and headed for the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at the thin figure as a complicated look flickered in his eyes. Even if he had forgotten his feelings for her, he remembered how much he hoped they could become a real married couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Think of it as fulfilling my wish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When this is over, I won't long for her anymore.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought to himself...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn was shocked when she learned that her daughter would soon move in with Martin Weiss. "So soon?"</p></div>
