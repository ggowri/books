        <h1>Chapter 2650</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "No, let's go to a bar today. Do you have a specific bar you want to go to?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not really," replied Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">20 minutes later, Brian pulled up at a bar's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller knew this bar. After all, she had researched many bars in tMason Swansonty for the protagonist&rsquo;s character.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bar that Brian brought her to was a new and popular bar in tMason Swansonty. However, the bar was more popular among the rich because of its high prices. Ordinary working-class people or students would not come here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, the bar was in line with the bar Valda Theller&rsquo;s protagonist owned. It was a good place to base her protagonist&rsquo;s bar on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only problem was... "Would it be expensive here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda Theller saw the prices, she instantly understood that their definition of &lsquo;expensive&rsquo; was completely different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at the menu and hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian seemed to see through her hesitation and said indifferently, "You can order whatever you want. Don't worry about the price."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since we're dating, we should play along with each other's spending habits. I had no opinions when you said you refused to accept my gift because you'll think what's fake is real if this were to go on for long. But it's too tiring if we have to calculate the price of every meal or drink every time we go out on dates."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian flipped through the menu and summoned a waiter to order two cocktails as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the waiter left, he said, "This bit of money doesn&rsquo;t mean anything to me, and you don't need to help me save money. What you're helping me with is more important than this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller paused. He was referring to her pretending to be his girlfriend. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think anyone will believe that I'm your girlfriend?"Valda Theller asked. Even Raymond Bowman did not think they were dating and thought she was being fooled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She and Brian were like people from two different worlds when they stood together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian murmured, "Yes, as long as you look like you love me and I look like I love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not that easy," muttered Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it difficult?" Brian said as he suddenly leaned over and caressed her cheek with one hand. "Valda, is it hard to pretend to love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller only felt her heartbeat racing at that moment. The cheek his palm pressed on seemed to burn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark phoenix eyes were no longer distant and indifferent but misty. They looked near yet far and were seductive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gosh, forget about pretending. It would be easy to fall in love with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does this man not know how captivating he is when he poses like this?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the waiter came over with two cocktails, so Valda Theller got to resolve the embarrassment she felt. She quickly turned her head, took the cocktail, and sipped it with her head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said nothing more on the subject and withdrew his hand. He picked up the cocktail in front of him and sipped gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller soon drank more than half the glass.</p></div>
