        <h1>Chapter 824</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin lazily waved his hand. "It seems that you don't want to apologize after bullying my girlfriend. As her boyfriend, I have to stand up for her. Otherwise, wouldn't I turn myself into a joke?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man was now lying flat on his stomach. The spot where he was hit with Hadwin&rsquo;s punch hurt so much that he could no longer speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Hadwin turned to Lily. "What about you, Miss Atkinson? Are you going to apologize?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The seemingly polite question had a dangerous tone to it. Lily even had the feeling that if she said no, she would end up like the man who was just beaten to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man in front of her would not have any compassion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily had now recognized the man in front of her. He was the new patriarch of the Stephenson family who just took office for more than half a year&mdash;Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He managed to take over the Stephenson family with the identity of a b*stard, which meant he was no rookie in terms of schemes and trickery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Stephenson family was now on a roll and was actively expanding in Emerald City. The Atkinson family had not been doing so well in recent years. Several major projects at hand had suffered losses. Some time ago, her father mentioned that he wanted to collaborate with the Stephenson family on several projects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect that Hadwin's girlfriend was... Grace's friend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily's face paled as she pursed her red lips, only feeling that the world was smaller than she imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not apologizing?" Hadwin's voice rang again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A sentence escaped Lily's mouth with much difficulty. "It's my fault, Miss..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sweeney. My girlfriend's last name is Sweeney," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Sweeney, please forgive me." With that, Lily stepped on her high heels and left without turning back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was still a little confused. From Hadwin's appearance to Lily apologizing and departure, everything happened too fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not until Hadwin took her into the VIP room of the auction and gave her a cup of juice to calm down that she finally came to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While blinking, she sipped her juice and looked around the VIP room. It was a place where even the director could not get in!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you here for the auction?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. Real estate is the best way to make money nowadays. If the Stephenson family wants to expand in Emerald City, real estate would be the safest choice," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Lina recalled that the Stephenson family did have any real estate companies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you call me? Were you really going to let yourself be dragged out if I didn't happen to bump into you?" asked Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned. Then, she said somewhat lamely, "I forgot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." he said somewhat helplessly. "You never take my words to heart, do you?" He had told her more than once to call him if she was in trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she never seemed to remember.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Not really&hellip;' Lina said to herself. She took it to heart when he said he wanted to become the sword in her hand that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because she cared so much about it that she kept thinking about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, which plot are you going to bid for?" asked Lina as she changed the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think? Which one's the best?" asked Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina immediately pointed to the most popular plots and said, "This one, of course. They&rsquo;re going to build a complex, right? I wonder which design firm will undertake this project. Wow, I'm itching just thinking about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin glanced at her thoughtfully. "Why, do you want to design a complex?"</p></div>
