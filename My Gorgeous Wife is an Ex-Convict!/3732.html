        <h1>Chapter 3730</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica never expected to hear the word "date" from Mason's mouth. A date... it felt like they were really in a relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want to?" Mason's voice rang in her ear again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," she quickly replied, "but if we're going on a date, is there anything you want to do?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just do some things that normal couples do, and see if we're compatible for a relationship," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Normal things that couples do? Veronica was taken aback, and memories of what she had done to him on the couch flashed through her mind. Oh my god, what was she thinking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, when?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have time on the weekend?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't have to work on the weekend, but... "I have something going on at school this weekend, there's a meeting in my class."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, call me 20 minutes before you come out, and I'll send someone to pick you up," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, just tell me where to meet you, and I'll go there myself," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wouldn't it be a waste of time for you to go by yourself? I don't want to waste too much time," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." Veronica was silent for a moment before saying, "Okay then."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did he mean he didn't want to waste time waiting for her, or did he mean... the time they spent trying to date each other?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did this kind of interaction mean to him? And yet, she was desperately trying to seize this one opportunity to get closer to him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, Veronica kept checking the time on her phone during the class meeting.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, what's wrong? You seem to be very concerned about the time," Shirley, who was sitting next to her, asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing, just that I have something else to do after the meeting today," she replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Something else? Don't tell me you're working today too," Shirley sighed, "Your dad is really something, not even paying for your tuition and making you work to earn it yourself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm already an adult, and I don't need him to pay for my tuition. This is fine for me now," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Fine? What's so fine about it? If you keep this up, you won't even have time to find a boyfriend," Shirley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Boyfriend... A blush appeared on Veronica's face as she thought of Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Come on! He's not even her boyfriend yet!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although... some of their actions towards each other seemed to be closer than those of a boyfriend and girlfriend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, that senior we saw the other day, the one you used to know. I noticed the way he looked at you, it seemed different. He's probably just doing delivery as a part-time job, but he looks pretty good. Have you been in contact with him since you reunited?" Shirley looked at Veronica with a suggestive expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's impossible between him and me," Veronica said with absolute certainty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, she and Daniel were impossible from the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just kidding. You're so firm in your denial," Shirley said, amazed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the class meeting was coming to an end, Veronica sent a text message to Mason: "I'm almost done here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Mason replied, saying that someone would pick her up at the school gate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who did you send the message to? Don't tell me you have a boyfriend and didn't tell me," Shirley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just... a friend," Veronica hesitated and said. Her relationship with Mason was considered that of friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the class meeting ended, she packed up her things and walked out of the campus. Suddenly, she was stunned when she saw a silver-gray Maybach parked at the school gate.</span></p></div>
