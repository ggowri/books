        <h1>Chapter 2694</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The arrest of the extras and Queenie Mack were kept under wraps for the time being. The production team was going to replace 17 actors. The news of it received attention as the list included important roles such as the second female lead, the fourth female lead, the fifth female lead, the third male lead, the fifth male lead, and the sixth male lead&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before the paparazzi heard about the drama's massive cast change and could figure out why, word came that the director would also be replaced. The one taking over his place was a big shot in the industry who had filmed many popular films.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It set off waves in the media. The reporters gathered at the set, trying to get the latest news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The film crew naturally replied formally that it was due to some personal reasons and scheduling conflicts. They also felt that some actors were too different from the characters, so they changed the actors and directors to produce a better show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to the film crew swarmed by reporters, Valda Theller's side was peaceful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bruises on her face and body had faded, and her body had stopped hurting. After more than a week at home, she was finally able to go out and see people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said on the phone that he would take her to a party today. He spoke nonchalantly that it was only a small party with him and several friends. He wanted to bring her so he could introduce her to his friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just relax and be natural. I only want them to know that I have a girlfriend," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller understood that Brian wanted to give others the illusion that he was in a relationship so that the person he loved would believe that he was truly dating someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller chose her outfit from her wardrobe and wore light makeup. Even if she was only a fake girlfriend, she did not want to embarrass Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller went downstairs when it was time, only to see Brian's car parked at the apartment's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tonight, Brian was not wearing his usual suit. Instead, he wore a casual beige shirt and light gray trousers, making him look elegant and relaxed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could not help lamenting when she saw Brian like this. 'No wonder many female celebrities in the entertainment industry are after the crown prince.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even without the Hart family, his charm was enough to attract many women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller got into the car, and Brian said while driving, "If you feel uncomfortable later, tell me. I'll get you out of there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She replied, "Oh. What are your friends like?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll find out after meeting them. And stay calm. They're probably more curious about you since they know I'm bringing my girlfriend over today. Anyway, ignore them if they ask questions you don't want to answer," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you good friends with them?" she asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're okay, I guess. We're from the same circle. I've known them since I was a child," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The same circle...' It made Valda Theller realize that she and Brian were from different worlds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a strange experience to have him bring her into her circle. When it was all over, she would return to her own world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove to the entrance of a private club, and Brian took Valda Theller inside.</p></div>
