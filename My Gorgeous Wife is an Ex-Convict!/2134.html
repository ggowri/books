        <h1>Chapter 2132</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He just wanted her to live... well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day, Grace went to the store to pick up Kyla before going to the hospital to visit Lina together. However, Lina still had not woken up, and Hadwin Stephenson looked like he had not slept the entire night. He looked somewhat haggard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What did the doctor say? Did they say how long it would take for Lina to wake up?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The doctor isn't sure, but they'll check on her soon," said Hadwin Stephenson. His hair was unkempt, and there was stubble on his chin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could only comfort him by saying, "Don't worry. Lina will wake up soon. She's probably just too exhausted from giving birth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, she'll wake up," muttered Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he clenched his hands as he spoke. It was as if he was trying to persuade himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For some reason, while she was looking at the sleeping Lina, Grace had a bad feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, Grace and Kyla went to the neonatal care unit to see Lina's newborn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was a pretty girl, but she was thinner than the average baby because she was born prematurely. However, she had large dark eyes and looked so adorable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They learned from the doctor on duty that the baby was three weeks early, but she was doing well and could return to the ward later this evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace only hoped that Lina could wake up in the evening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The baby is so beautiful. If I hadn't seen her with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe that a baby who wasn&rsquo;t breathing just earlier would be so healthy in less than 24 hours!" Kyla said emotionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The average baby with this condition would have spent more than a week in the incubator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "You could call her lucky, I guess? But... I wonder who that little boy is. He&rsquo;s so mysterious!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Could it be like what Lina speculated? Does he have superpowers?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How is that possible..." said Grace. However, her tone sounded doubtful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The following days seemed to confirm Grace's bad feeling. Lina still had not woken up. Mr. Sweeney, Mrs. Sweeney, and Hadwin Stephenson stayed in Lina's ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney kept calling out to their daughter as they cried, while Hadwin Stephenson was silent. He just stared blankly at Lina, not even willing to glance at his newborn daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The best doctors in Emerald City had gathered at the hospital to check on Lina, but the result they got was that... the patient was in good health and should be awake by now. They did not know why she had not woken up yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The longer the coma lasted, the more likely the patient would become a vegetable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could hardly accept it when she heard the word &lsquo;vegetable&rsquo;!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">How could Lina become a vegetable?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was appalled. "Is there no other way? How could she become a vegetable just from delivering a baby?"</p></div>
