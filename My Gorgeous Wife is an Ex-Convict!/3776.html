That classmate of yours is probably regretting everything she said now and wishing she hadn't said anything," Veronica said. "By the way, where are we going now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're going to have lunch with Jasper and William. They should be waiting for us in the restaurant by now," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, the restaurant?" Veronica was surprised.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason took her to a restaurant near the school. Jasper and William had chosen a private room, and when Veronica followed Mason into the room, she saw Jasper and William playing mobile games.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Sister Veronica, you're here. William and I are playing a game. You and Mason can order first. We'll finish this game soon," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." Veronica nodded and sat down with Mason. She scanned the QR code on the table with her phone and opened the menu page.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The restaurant served Emerald City's home-style dishes. Veronica ordered a few dishes and then let Mason order.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Mason finished ordering, Jasper and William's game seemed to have entered a fierce stage. Jasper would occasionally shout, "Ah...ah, William, come save me, I can't take it anymore...I'm going to die..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah! What should I do? I'm dead. Wait for me to respawn..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Quick, hurry up, help me block it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"One wave, one wave, here comes a wave..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica rested her chin on her hand and watched Jasper playing games. She used to play these online games on her phone too, but she stopped playing after she broke up with Mason. Playing games always reminded her of the times she played with Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Firstly, she didn't want to be reminded of the past and get upset. Secondly, she didn't have the time anymore. Her time was mostly spent on studying and working, and carefree life seemed to be getting further away from her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching Jasper and William playing games now made her miss the times she played games with Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"OK, we barely won!" Jasper let out a sigh of relief and put down his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That was satisfying," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper smiled, "Yeah, it was."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, I ordered some food earlier. Take a look and see if you want to add anything," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, you and Mason ordered enough. William and I will just eat," Mason said, his gaze suddenly falling on Veronica and Mason's phones. "Hey, Sister Veronica, you and Mason have the same phone charm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's face turned slightly red. "Yeah, we bought it at a booth in your school. It's pretty nice."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it a couple charm? Are you and Mason officially dating now?" Jasper looked at Veronica with a sharp gaze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason didn't say anything, but his gaze was also on Veronica, as if waiting for her answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica pursed her lips and answered honestly, "Yeah, we're dating."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If we're going to date, let's do it openly and honestly. There's no need to hide anything.</span></p></div>
