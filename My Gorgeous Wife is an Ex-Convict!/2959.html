        <h1>Chapter 2957</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the store, after the manager made sure that Brian didn't need anything else, he left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at Brian and asked, "Do you know this store manager?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I should say I know the owner of this store, so I've been here a few times before. That's why the store manager knows me," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda suddenly realized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This shop owner, you know him too," Brian added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was surprised, "I know him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's Patrick," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Patrick?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda didn't expect that Camille would take her to a restaurant owned by Patrick for dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It just goes to show that the world is really quite small.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't associate with classmates like that in the future," Brian said. With his experience, he could easily tell what kind of intentions the other person had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just happened to bump into her here today. I had no idea she would say those things. We didn't have any issues in high school," Valda muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Some people just can't stand seeing others doing better than themselves," Brian said, looking at Valda with a gaze that he himself didn't realize was indulgent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she has experienced many ups and downs, Grace still retains a kindness and innocence at her core.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This kind of kindness and innocence has a fatal attraction for someone like him. He wants to protect her kindness and innocence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Camille returned and upon seeing Brian, quickly expressed her gratitude once again for saving her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Hart, I'm treating you and Valda to this meal today as a way of expressing my gratitude," said Camille. "If it weren't for you two, I don't know what else I would have faced every day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian didn't refuse when he heard this, "You're Valda's friend, you can call me by my name directly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This statement is actually a recognition of Camille's abilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille also smiled and responded happily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The dishes began to be served on the table one by one, and Brian helped Valda set up the bowls and fork, arranging the dishes with such grace and ease that it seemed effortless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille looked at Brian, who was taking care of his friend like a little princess, and exclaimed, "Ah, having a boyfriend is so great! Even meals are taken care of by your boyfriend. I envy you guys so much. Watching you two is like watching a romantic drama."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda blushed slightly and said, "You're exaggerating too much, it's not like a drama."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is not an exaggeration at all. Your family member would be a perfect example if placed in an idol drama nowadays. If he were to act in one, the drama would definitely become a hit," said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda glanced at Brian beside her and felt that her friend's words seemed to be true. "If we really make an idol drama, it's indeed easy to become popular." After all, Brian's appearance is superior to many A-list male stars in the industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you hoping that I will go and film an idol drama?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I wished for it, would you really go and take it?" joked Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's possible." He said, "If you're willing to be the leading actress, I can go ahead and shoot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice sounded normal, but it gave the impression that if Valda was willing to take on the lead actress role at this moment, he would definitely film it.</p></div>
