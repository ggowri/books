        <h1>Chapter 2553</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If anyone got in his way, he would get them out of the way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to see Amber Mitchell. He wanted to see Amber Mitchell no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his hand and swung it fiercely at the man in front of him. The entrance to the cemetery started becoming chaotic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the cemetery, Amber Mitchell stood in front of Herman Moss's grave. Workers took out the old tombstone and replaced it with a new one. There was a new line with the words &lsquo;Wife, Amber Mitchell&rsquo; next to the words &lsquo;Husband, Herman Moss&rsquo; on the tombstone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only difference was that the words &lsquo;Herman Moss&rsquo; were drawn with red ink, representing that he had died. Meanwhile, the words &lsquo;Amber Mitchell&rsquo; were in gold, representing that she was still alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Amber Mitchell died and her ashes were put into this tomb, the gold words would be painted red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked quietly at the new tombstone and murmured, "Herman, I&rsquo;ll go look for you someday. But I might be old by then. You'd better recognize me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even looked forward to the day when her ashes would be placed next to his. They would quietly be with each other forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, someone hurried up to Daley Moss and whispered something in his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss's expression froze. Whitney Herrera, who was standing next to Daley Moss, watched her husband's expression change slightly as she whispered, "What's wrong? Did something happen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory's here, and there's a fight outside," said Daley Moss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Whitney Herrera was shocked. "Why is George Gregory here? Does... Does he know about what's going on here today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the Moss family was holding the wedding in secret and had never disclosed it. How could George Gregory have known?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss said, "I don't know. But he can't get into the Moss family's cemetery so easily!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Daley Moss instructed the messenger, "Keep George Gregory outside and don't let him disturb us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," the person answered and hurriedly left again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The ceremony went on, and the new tombstone was set. A priest began the wedding ceremony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the groom was unable to make any sound in this special ceremony. Only the bride answered &lsquo;I do&rsquo; and recited the marriage vows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Amber Mitchell completed her vows, two rings were handed to her, one of which was a male wedding ring that Amber Mitchell had made into a necklace. She wore it around her neck. The other was a female wedding ring that she held in her right hand and carefully put it on the ring finger of her left hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was her wedding ring&mdash;her and Herman's wedding ring. She would be wearing these two rings for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a voice suddenly rang out just as the ring was about to slip onto her ring finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell, stop!" The roar was so loud that everyone there looked in that direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, there was the sound of footsteps. The security guards guarding the cemetery entrance came over. When the one leading the security guards realized the ceremony had been disturbed, he rushed to Daley Moss's side and cautiously said, "Mr. Moss, I'm sorry. I failed to stop the man. I'll ask them to take this man away immediately!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, the man ordered his men to take George Gregory away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Daley Moss, you'd better ask them to leave me alone if you don't want me to have someone demolish the Moss family's cemetery!" George Gregory threatened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss narrowed his eyes slightly. "The Gregory family might have a hard time setting foot in the Moss family's cemetery. George Gregory, you broke into the Moss family's cemetery. Shouldn't you explain yourself first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Explain?' George Gregory looked at the woman in a wedding dress nearby. It was Amber Mitchell, the person he had wronged the most in his life.</p></div>
