        <h1>Chapter 3322</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did Jasper fall asleep?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I just woke up not long ago. Today, I'll sleep in her room with her. I'm worried that she might wake up in the middle of the night and cry again," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Jason responded, "then you should also go to bed early and don't worry too much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, he walked closer to Grace and leaned down to give her a kiss on the forehead. "I'll head back now," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait a minute," Grace stopped Jason and said, "Jason, what should we tell Jasper if we still can't find Lawrence after some time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She's afraid that it will have a bigger impact on her daughter if she does it later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, there are some things that she always understands and learns to accept," Jason said, such as leaving and death...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grace, Jasper is our daughter. She needs to grow up slowly and become stronger. Otherwise, what will she do when she faces more difficulties in the future?" Jason said, looking at his sleeping daughter. "As a father, I want to protect her and make her happy for her whole life, but life is full of unexpected events that we cannot control."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace sighed, knowing that Jason was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this world, nothing is ever perfect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There are always things we need to face, whether it's sadness or happiness... they are all part of our own experiences!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She just hopes that her daughter can be stronger by that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the official announcement by the police, the tragedy of the Abbott family became a hot topic in tMason Swansonty for a while. Valda naturally became aware of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After seeing the news, she made a phone call to Grace to confirm that the people mentioned in the news were indeed the Abbott couple and Lawrence. She felt a sense of sadness and regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, that was a child she had seen before, but now they are missing and their whereabouts are unknown, and there is a high possibility that they have been silenced by someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about Jasper?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm still feeling sad. It will probably take some time before I can calm down," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda suggests that it would be better for the child to spend more time with peers of the same age, which may help her feel better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, Mick and Mason will be accompanying me, and William is also planning to come to Emerald City," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her own two sons, however, are not talkative.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These days, Mick has been spending time with Jasper both at school and at home. Even though he doesn't talk much, he stays by her side and is always there for her. He even sleeps in Jasper's room at night, holding a pillow and blanket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Mason, Grace didn't expect him to come all the way to The Reed House just to accompany Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Mason doesn't usually come over to the Reed family's side on his own. He mostly likes to hang out with the Barlow family and be with their daughter Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, this time Mason came alone with a bodyguard accompanying him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He also played a piano piece for Jasper and awkwardly said, "If you like listening to piano music, I can play for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This made Jasper burst into tears and hug Mason on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Mason, surprisingly, did not push it away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Normally, Mason only allows hugs from Veronica. If anyone else tries to hug him, he will resist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the past, Jasper often wanted to hug her brother, but Mason always rejected her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time, Mason stood quietly, allowing Jasper to hug him, which made Grace notice Mason's change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, Mason gradually developed feelings towards his family and was no longer indifferent towards them.</p></div>
