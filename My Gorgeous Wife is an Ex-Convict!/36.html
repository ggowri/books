        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily and Annabelle seemed as if they had had enough of looking at Grace's dejected form searching through the rubbish and decided to drive away.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Annabelle asked, "How long are you going to let her look for it?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily replied casually, "Let her look for it till late at night, just before I go to bed. Then, I'll call the director and tell them that it's fine if they can't find the ring. I'll just acknowledge my misfortunes."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Heh, you let her off easily," Annabelle said. "If Sean saw her now, I'm afraid he'd vomit. Grace is not worthy of people like Sean. Only a socialite such as you can match him."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as the red Maserati started its engine, several police cars suddenly drove toward them. In the blink of an eye, the Maserati was surrounded by the police.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A policeman stepped out of one of the cars and knocked on Maserati's glass window.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily lowered the window and heard the policeman say, "We received a report that a ring worth hundreds of thousands was lost here. We're going to lodge a report now to investigate if the ring was lost or stolen."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Lodge a report?" Lily and Annabelle were both stunned.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But we didn't call the police!" Annabelle shouted noisily.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, the policeman paid them no mind and continued, "Anything worth over a hundred thousand dollars is considered a major case. We would appreciate your cooperation and we also hope to help the two of you recover the ring."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the problem is... no ring was lost! The two of them exchanged looks. Lily spoke through clenched teeth, "I don't want to investigate the missing ring further. It's fine if it can't be found."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If this is a theft, then the value of the item qualifies it as a criminal case and we have to lodge a report to conduct an investigation. If you could please get out of the car and confirm the general area where you realized the ring was lost." The officer handling this case wasn&rsquo;t taking any chances.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to do this by the book, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; He opened the car door for Lily. &ldquo;Now, if you&rsquo;d please step out of the car. We&rsquo;ll take a statement from each of you, separately&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">personnel who was handling the case said insistently.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily and Annabelle exited the warm car and were welcomed by a cold blast of air. They walked to the spot where they had been speaking to Grace just then. However, the place was now covered with piles of rubbish.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A large mass of rubbish that had originally been in the bins had now been poured out. The piles had been placed out in the open to facilitate the search for the ring.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The stench of the rubbish drifted over ceaselessly. Lily and Annabelle were both dressed flashily and stood out even more in the midst of the piles of rubbish. And yet, the personnel handling the case was not willing to let them leave, insisting that they stand still as they recounted their experience.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their recounting was an ordeal. After they finished, they thought they would be able to leave but the personnel said, "Since we're already looking for the ring, then would the two of you just stand here and wait a moment? If the ring is found, you'll be able to immediately confirm if it's yours."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Stand here?" Annabelle asked with surprise.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But it's so dirty and smelly here..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, an alarming voice suddenly rang out nearby, "Oh my god, that must be Lily! I'm actually getting to see a huge celebrity!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Immediately after, a large crowd of people gathered around them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why is she standing in the middle of a rubbish pile?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are those police standing next to them? Are they filming a movie now?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The surrounding crowd erupted in wild discussions.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I think it's best if I leave now. I will let my assistant and lawyer assist the police regarding this matter," Lily said, mentally wishing to leave the place as soon as possible.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Miss Atkinson, I know you're a celebrity, but the sanitation workers are currently working hard to find the ring for you. You're the party concerned and your role is to just stand aside and wait, can't you even do that? Or do you think you're better than everyone else?" the policeman retorted righteously.</p></div>
