        <h1>Chapter 3521</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Afterwards, Mason never returned to the country. When Veronica saw him again, it was already the day of the kidnapping trial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason attended as a witness. When Veronica saw him, tears filled her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they weren't in court at that moment, she might have rushed over, taken his hand, and apologized...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even later in court, she didn't hear what he said. Her eyes were fixed on him. After he finished his testimony and left the courtroom, she instinctively wanted to follow him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica!" Jasper grabbed her and said, "It's almost our turn. You can look for Mason later. He's back this time and I heard from our parents that he shouldn't be leaving the country again soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Veronica murmured, her excited emotions slowly calming down because of Jasper's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When did Mason come back?" she asked, her voice choked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He probably just got off the plane not long ago. Anyway, Mason didn't come home last night," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the first day of the trial ended, Veronica rushed out of the courtroom to look for Mason's figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Where could he be? Is he still here at the courthouse? Or has he already left? If he has left, then...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she was guessing in her heart, suddenly, her gaze caught sight of a familiar figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was...Mason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica stared at Mason, who was not far away, and tears couldn't help but roll down her cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then she watched as he took steps towards her, one by one, until he was standing right in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her tears fell even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, he stopped in front of her. His beautiful black eyes stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason..." Veronica choked, "I finally...finally see you again. I'm sorry. I...I want to apologize to you. I shouldn't have doubted you before...I'm sorry. I know this kidnapping case has nothing to do with you. I should have believed you. Can you forgive me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I forgive you." His calm voice spoke, and his expression was also incredibly calm. It was as if what she said was just an ordinary thing that didn't stir any emotions in him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, he lifted his foot expressionlessly and was about to pass by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was startled by his calmness, which made her feel uneasy. Almost instinctively, she grabbed his hand and said, "Wait!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stopped walking and glanced at the hand she was holding. In a flat tone, he said, "Let go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, can you wait for a moment?" She said anxiously, "I have a lot to say to you. Let's find a place to talk, okay?"</p></div>
