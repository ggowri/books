        <h1>Chapter 4060</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her confidence was instantly cut in half. After all, he was eight years older than her, and because of this age difference, she had always been inferior to him in terms of confidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Isn't it said that practice is the only criterion for testing truth?" She muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I thought the practice just now was enough," Chandler said. "Or do you actually hate kissing me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No, no, of course not!" She quickly replied. Kissing him felt amazing, "But... we could practice a little more, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I already said, except for sex!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, that means no sex, but it doesn't mean we can't touch and kiss more," Tina said. "Shouldn't we become more intimate?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He stared at her, his eyes suddenly darkening. "So you want to be more intimate with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes...yes," she said, feeling a little nervous under his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Okay, I understand." Chandler began unbuttoning his shirt. "So even if I treat you like this, it's what you want, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As he spoke, he wrapped his arm around her waist and pressed her onto the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina felt her body heat up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was strange. She had been held by him countless times since childhood, even lying on the same bed together many times, but at this moment, she felt her whole body heating up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Was it because they had just kissed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As she was thinking, she suddenly felt a warm sensation on her lips. After a second of confusion, she realized he was kissing her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But unlike the previous kisses, this one was more dominant and intense, making it hard for her to catch her breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Wait...wait..." She managed to say, but before she could finish, his lips were on hers again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> His fingers began to slowly undo her clothes, and the skin on her shoulders broke out in goosebumps as it was suddenly exposed to the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As his lips finally left hers, she gasped for air while his lips continued down, kissing her neck and shoulders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Small kisses sucked on her skin, leaving marks on her flesh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His kisses continued down, and Tina's body grew hotter, her skin turning pink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was a completely unfamiliar feeling for her, and when his fingers touched her skin and continued down, the feeling of being lost in the unknown overwhelmed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No!" She unconsciously shouted out these two words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His actions stopped. "Are you scared? So don't think that making love is that simple. Once a man loses control, no matter how much you shout no, it's useless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, Chandler straightened up, intending to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Tina grabbed his hand again. "I'm not scared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Chandler was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not scared of you. I will never be scared of you. Just now, it was just because I haven't experienced it before, so I was a bit..." She thought for a moment, seeming unsure of how to describe it. "Anyway, it's not fear. I'm ready now, let's continue!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This statement made Chandler somewhat amused and exasperated.</p></div>
