        <h1>Chapter 2222</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, when he found out about the beatings and humiliations she received in prison, it even terrified a man like him. He had no idea how she survived it all while pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry. I'm sorry..." muttered Martin Weiss, his eyes heavy with regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla paused before saying indifferently, "I don't want to discuss who's right and who's wrong in whatever's between us. I just hope we can end all our grudges and return to our peaceful lives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss could not help smiling wryly. 'Yes, return to our peaceful lives. It's what she wants the most, right? And I owe it to her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay. If you want peace, then I&rsquo;ll give you peace. I&rsquo;ll return to L City after you give birth to the baby. I'll hand over the branch company in Emerald City to someone else, so you don't have to worry that I&rsquo;ll affect your normal life," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked somewhat blankly at Martin Weiss. What he said was what she wanted to hear. He would leave Emerald City after the baby was born. Then, she and he might only occasionally see each other in regards to their children. She could live in complete peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, why did her heart feel empty because of what he said?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her in a trance, he seemed to recall something and added, "If you&rsquo;re worried about the divorce, just give me a call. I&rsquo;ll come to Emerald City and divorce you whenever you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla pressed her lips together. In truth, she had not been thinking about it at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, he&rsquo;ll leave Emerald City after I give birth to the baby. Maybe the next time we&rsquo;ll see each other is when we're getting divorced.&rsquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they reached the hospital, Kyla accompanied Martin Weiss to the emergency room. The doctor redressed Martin Weiss's wound and told him not to hold any heavy objects with his hand for the next few days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor said, "Don&rsquo;t take it lightly just because it's a superficial wound. Your wound will only get worse if you delay the recovery. It might not just be a superficial wound by then. Don't eat any stimulating food. That way, your wound can heal faster."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After coming out of the hospital, Martin Weiss said, "Would you like to go for a meal? I can sit at a different table. I won't disturb you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla turned to look at the man beside her. The man was so wary around her. It was different from his calm overbearingness from when they were in the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His wariness made her feel as if something was pressing against her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. Let's just share a table," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss seemed surprised, but a smile appeared on his face afterward. "Okay." It was like a gift to him that she was willing to eat at the same table as him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because the cut on my hand burst open when I was punching someone for her today? Is it compassion or an apology? Is that why she's willing to dine with me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, whatever it was, he would take it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whether it was her sympathy or something else, he wanted it, What he could not bear the most was her indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was indifference, it felt as if he had ceased to exist in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never wanted to see her look at him that way again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two arrived at a small noodle restaurant near the hospital. Kyla ordered a bowl of noodles with pork chop and looked at Martin Weiss.</p></div>
