        <h1>Chapter 1468</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He never thought she would find out about the truth of the case like this. It even almost made her give birth prematurely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If anything had happened to her, he would never have forgiven himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He went over to the bed and looked at her sleeping face in the moonlight. Her eyes were a little puffy, and she looked slightly pale. A few strands of hair clung to her cheeks. Even when she was asleep, her hand lay protectively against her belly, showing how much she cared for the babies in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was gambling her life on these three babies!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm sorry... I'm sorry..." His voice was a little hoarse. "It was my fault. I was so preoccupied with profits that I had no compassion. I thought it was just a small matter and never thought about what it meant to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was just profit to him at the time. Besides, the Atkinson family had never pointed out to his face that Lily was the culprit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he could sort of guess who the culprit was from a few clues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that time, he had no feelings for Jennifer, so he did not bother to get involved in the Atkinson family's affairs. It was just the death of a fianc&eacute;e to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could just find another fianc&eacute;e if the Reed family needed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Yes, that was what it had meant to him back then. All he wanted to do was expand and develop the Reed family. Profits came first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was nothing to him back then. He never cared about her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, just like what she said, he had put someone innocent in prison for money. His indifference had harmed her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No matter how many times he apologized, it could not make up for what she had suffered in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason gently touched Grace's hand. Her slightly deformed joints stung his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her hand... seemed to tell him in silence how cruel his decision had been.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He did not even know what to do to get her to forgive him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The moonlight shone into the room through the window. The man stood by the bed, carefully touching the sleeping woman. He was afraid that he would wake her up. There was a helpless fragility on the man's face as if he would completely crumble with one gentle push.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was hospitalized for several days and never met Jason during this time. She was supposed to stay in the hospital for only three days, but she did not want to go back to Reed Residence, so she continued to stay in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had someone to take care of her meals every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace forced herself to stop thinking. She made herself relax by watching dramas or reading magazines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn came to see her once again. After learning that she had not met Jason, she could not help saying, "Even if you have some problems, you should see him. Talk it through and sort it out. If there's a misunderstanding, you can clarify it sooner by talking. Don't be like me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn did not go on, but the meaning was already clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In Kyla Corbyn's opinion, if Martin Weiss had not approached her to be in a romantic relationship with her and instead explained to her their previous generation's feud, she probably would not have hated Martin Weiss even though he was bent on the Corbyn family paying the price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, it was indeed her father's fault. Even if Martin Weiss blamed it on her, she would have paid the price more willingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now, she could only stop hating Martin Weiss but could not love him anymore no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could only taste bitterness in her mouth after Kyla Corbyn left.</p></div>
