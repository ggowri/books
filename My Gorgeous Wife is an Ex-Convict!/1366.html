        <h1>Chapter 1365</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... it was probably her greatest regret that she could not see him grow up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they got downstairs, Martin Weiss's car was already there and Martin Weiss was leaning against the side of the car. He was seemingly lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Daddy!" Nelson immediately shouted when he saw Martin Weiss from a distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked up and saw Kyla Corbyn wearing a light blue wool dress and a pair of white sneakers. She had some light makeup on her face and carried a navy blue canvas bag on her back. She looked different from how she looked when she was running the food stall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked somewhat like the woman she had been before going to prison, pretty and vivacious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Martin Weiss was in a trance, the big and small figures had approached him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good morning, Daddy," Nelson said politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good morning..." replied Martin Weiss. Then, he said, "Hurry up and get in the car, or it'll be too late when we get to the amusement park."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he quickly opened the car door as if to cover up his moment of absentmindedness earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson got into the back seat first. Just as Kyla Corbyn was about to get into the car, Martin Weiss suddenly grabbed her arm and said in a voice that only both of them could hear, "I don't care what your purpose is today, but you&rsquo;d better not do anything you shouldn't do. The Weiss family's mistress can only be Paisley!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn replied lightly, "I know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her reaction made him feel powerless. It was as if he had thrown a defensive punch but it ended up hitting a ball of cotton instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, can you let go? Nelson will be worried," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, Nelson's voice sounded from the car. "Mommy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face turned cold, and he let go. Kyla Corbyn bent over and got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss got in the driver's seat and drove toward the amusement park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was the most talkative person during the journey there, and Kyla Corbyn spent most of the time just quietly listening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could see Martin Weiss's back from where she was sitting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She used to like to sit in the front passenger seat while he was driving and claimed it as her seat, but now... She was never getting back in the front passenger seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although it was strange, she kept recalling the time she used to spend with Martin Weiss these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, she even wondered if all the memories that had been buried deep in her heart were recurring to her one by one because she was dying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, these memories no longer affected her mood. She felt no sadness or joy. It was as if she was watching someone else's story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not even need to warn her like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no more feelings for him ever since she went to prison. She just wanted to leave a good memory for Nelson today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she passed, then Nelson would never have been to the amusement park with his mother and father, which might become his lifelong regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hoped to leave her child with fewer regrets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they arrived, Kyla Corbyn got down from the car and took her son&rsquo;s hand to get entry tickets while Martin Weiss went to park the car. She had already booked three tickets for the amusement park.</p></div>
