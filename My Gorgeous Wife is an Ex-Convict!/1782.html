        <h1>Chapter 1780</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't take medicine!" Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked at her best friend with a puzzled look on her face. "Don't take medicine? Then what should I take?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace pressed her lips together and sized her best friend up a little hesitantly. "Have you... uh... had sex recently?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was dumbfounded for about ten seconds before she suddenly realized what her best friend meant. Her somewhat pale face instantly turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace quickly said, "I... I don't mean anything else. I'm just afraid it's not a good idea to take medicine if you're... pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked at Grace and then at her flat belly... 'Am I pregnant?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she was pregnant, then the child... could only be Hadwin Stephenson's!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... it would be ridiculous if she were really pregnant!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had once looked forward to conceiving that man's child because she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him. However, if she were pregnant with Hadwin Stephenson's child, they would only be more entangled with each other!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had finally drawn a line with Hadwin Stephenson. What... <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>did this mean now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at her best friend's reaction, Grace also figured that Lina... was probably pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is it Hadwin Stephenson's?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina smiled bitterly and looked up at Grace. "It's funny, isn't it? It never happened when I wanted it to, yet it has happened when I don't want it to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You&rsquo;d better get yourself checked. Maybe it's not what we think," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said, "I know. But... if it's true, then... what should I do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is it really impossible for you to be with Hadwin Stephenson?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina sighed. "If I wanted to be with him, I wouldn't have rejected him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was also aware of her best friend's concerns. Besides, she was in no position to meddle in other people&rsquo;s relationships. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Lina, I'm on your side no matter what decision you make. If you want the baby, then I'll be their godmother and help you raise the baby. If you... don't want the baby, I'll accompany you to the surgery!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As the mother of three children, Grace understood what it was like to be a mother. The baby in the womb was something a mother could not bear to abandon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, Hadwin Stephenson was once the man Lina loved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... Even if Lina did intend to abort the baby, she would accompany her as long as Lina had thought it through and was not impulsive when making the decision. No matter what Lina had to face, she would face it together with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina looked a little blankly at her best friend, her eyes watering a little. "Grace, thank you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After coming out of Grace's ward, Lina went straight to the hospital's gynecology department to do a blood test.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The blood test report would not come out until an hour later, and during that hour, Lina felt as if a lifetime had passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She felt nervous, uneasy, and at a loss... She did not know what she would do if it turned out to be the last thing she wanted.</p></div>
