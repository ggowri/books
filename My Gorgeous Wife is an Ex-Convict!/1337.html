        <h1>Chapter 1336</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was usually a low-key person, but now, she had to toughen up for Kyla. Otherwise, Paisley Daniels would only bully Kyla even more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels's eyes gleamed a little, but she still stubbornly said, "Okay, I'd love to find out the truth too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace ignored Paisley Daniels. She just looked over and asked Kyla Corbyn, "Kyla, can you get up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." Kyla Corbyn forced herself to smile and staggered to her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was going to help Kyla Corbyn, but Jason said, "Let me do it." With that, he took Kyla Corbyn's arm, and the three walked toward the police station's exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes narrowed slightly. He knew Jason and Kyla Corbyn had nothing to do with each other. It was only because of Grace that the man was willing to help Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss still found the sight particularly unpleasant to his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn did not even look at Martin Weiss when she passed by him. She completely ignored him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's thin lips were almost pressed into a straight line. He stared at Kyla Corbyn's leaving figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels was upset as she looked at Martin Weiss. He was looking at Kyla Corbyn's back so intently that some unease rose in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does he still hold that b*tch Kyla Corbyn in his heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But Martin and I will be married soon. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if he still has Kyla Corbyn in his heart. But he can only have me in there after this!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After coming out of the police station, Paisley Daniels was still pretending and crying about her grievances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just thought that since I was going to raise Nelson, I should resolve my feud with Kyla Corbyn. But... she slapped me in the face without any reason. She previously caused me to miscarry and lose my child, and now she did such a thing to me. Am I supposed to tolerate it? I wanted to patch things up with her because I didn't want to make things hard for you, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels looked so pitiful while she cried. Especially when the street light fell on her cheek which still had the slap print as the lighting made it seem all the more striking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, looking at the slap print on Paisley Daniels&rsquo;s face, Kyla Corbyn's bruised face flashed before Martin Weiss's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gaze on Paisley Daniels also sharpened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... What's the matter?" Paisley Daniels suddenly felt guilty. It was as if his eyes could see through everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure those trouble-making thugs have nothing to do with you?" Martin Weiss asked in a grim tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels's heartbeat suddenly quickened, but she still put on an aggrieved look. "Martin, do you think I had something to do with it? Do you believe what that woman Grace said? She and Kyla Corbyn are in this together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stared at Paisley Daniels for a while and said after a moment, "We'll find out whether you have something to do with this after investigating it. Paisley, I've made Kyla Corbyn pay for taking our baby&rsquo;s life by sending her to jail. I don't want any more trouble that people can make fun of, do you understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels felt a pang in her heart. By saying this... he believed that she did it! He was just trying to save her dignity by not saying it out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... see." Paisley Daniels bit her red lip and lowered her head. A gleam of jealousy flashed across her eyes.</p></div>
