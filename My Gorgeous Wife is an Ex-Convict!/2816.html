        <h1>Chapter 2814</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was only standing there but looked like a celebrity or supermodel out of a poster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If her parents were still alive, they would be amazed to meet someone like Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would they have difficulty believing she had found such a brilliant boyfriend?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It&rsquo;d be great if they were still alive...' Valda Theller's nose turned sore as her eyes reddened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to cry?" Brian noticed something different about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller sniffed and suddenly muttered, "Do you know I caused my parents' death? It's why my aunt calls me a Jayx and thinks I'm someone who brings bad luck to people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had kept some things in her heart for years. She had never told anyone about them, but she suddenly wanted to confide in him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've never been a Jayx, so don't take it all on yourself," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But it was my fault. My dad wasn't feeling well that day, but I made a fuss and insisted on going to the canyon, so my dad took some fever medicine and drove me and my mom there. But the fever medicine contained valium... We got into a car accident. My dad died on the spot while my mom cradled me in her arms. She ended up staying in the hospital for two days before passing away. I was only slightly injured."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even to this day, the horror of that scene still filled her mind sometimes when she dreamed at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you think of it that way, aren't you betraying your parents' wish for you to live? Your parents wouldn't want to see you in pain," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Betray?" murmured Valda Theller. Her eyes stared at the black and white photos on the tombstones. They were her parents&rsquo; photos. That was what they looked like when they were alive. "Yes, I... I can't betray their wish. I want to live a good life. I gotta make an effort to live each day well so that I don't betray their wish..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, tears kept pouring out of her eyes as she spoke. They were like loose pearls, flowing constantly...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She fumbled to wipe her tears. "I won't cry... I won't cry... They dislike seeing me crying the most. I won't cry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried desperately to stop the tears, but they kept pouring out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What should she do to stop crying?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a hand grabbed her shoulder and pulled her into a wide embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The familiar and reassuring scent poured into her nose. An elegant voice spoke softly above her head, "Don't cry... Alright, stop crying..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Like magic, the voice slowly stopped her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her face in his arms, she felt for the first time that she was not so alone! She used to come alone on this day and feel the loneliness and pain all by herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She now had someone by her side, helping her ease the pain little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, Valda Theller finally left Brian's arms. "I'll... stop crying. They like to see me laugh, not cry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were red as she said this, and her face was covered with tears, but she was trying hard to smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian only felt his heart being struck by something. It was heartache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart broke for this woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the incense burned out, Valda Theller blew out the candle and cleaned up before saying to Brian, "Alright, let's go back. I appreciate you coming here with me today."</p></div>
