        <h1>Chapter 844</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kiss... Kiss you?" Her face went red, and she even started stuttering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her in a way that even he did not realize just how greedy he was being. "Yes, that night at the entrance of Drunken Days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was rendered speechless. 'Drunken Days?' It seemed that drinking was really a mistake!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect to have kissed him when she blacked out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you don't believe me, I'll ask Terrence over for you to ask him," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Terrence? Terrence? His secretary? Did he see it?' Grace's face grew redder!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Or we can pull out the nearby surveillance footage from that night. They probably have it on video," he added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt the urge to bury herself in a hole.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Surveillance... Does this count as a damning indictment?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... No need," she said, looking embarrassed. If she had known how she was going to behave after getting drunk that day, she would never have taken a sip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her head and dared not look at Jason's eyes again. As such, she did not realize that he was looking at her with such fascination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face was getting closer and closer to hers. He could not help but want to kiss her crimson cheeks&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Creak!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the door was pushed open. It was the assistant who had gone to fetch the medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The assistant was stunned when he saw what was going on inside the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man was squatting in front of the woman like he was kneeling on one knee. His hands were massaging the woman's knees through her long dress, and his handsome face was close to the woman's. He looked... obsessed and infatuated as if the only thing the man had in his eyes was this woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could such a look... appear on the famous Master Reed's face?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Didn't they say Master Reed is cold and heartless?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The assistant had only heard that Jason had brought a woman here for treatment, but it was the first time he was seeing it for himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of the assistant opening the door startled Jason and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The obsession on Jason's face was instantly replaced by coldness. Out of the corner of his eyes, he coldly glanced at the assistant, causing the fellow to break into a cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins, here's your medicine. The instructions are the same as before, but this week, we've added a box of western medicine for pain relief. They&rsquo;re all written in the instructions." The assistant hurried forward and handed Grace the medicine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, thank you." Grace took the medicine and hurried to get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason took her hand and said, "Stay seated. I'll see if there's any medicine you can take right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he said this, he took her medicine and looked at them. He found that the western medicine could be taken immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he read the instructions, took two tablets as the instructions instructed, poured some warm water, and brought it all to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The assistant, who had not yet left, looked on with astonishment. Emerald City's high and mighty Master Reed had always been served by others, but now he was waiting on someone else so that they would take their medicine.</p></div>
