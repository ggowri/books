        <h1>Chapter 2903</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There is still a slight pain, but it's just the usual menstrual cramps, nothing too unbearable," she said, blushing slightly when she mentioned the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He furrowed his brow, wondering just how painful it was for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard that if it hurts, boiling ginger and brown sugar water can help alleviate the pain," he suddenly suggested. This was something he had heard from Patrick Weiss and his friends during their idle chatter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"And what if it does?" Valda Theller retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart turned and walked into her kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller quickly followed, only to see him rummaging through her kitchen for ginger and brown sugar with ease. It was normal for him to know where things were since he had been in her kitchen during their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him in surprise. "What are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm going to make some ginger and brown sugar water. You can rest on the couch outside for a while," Brian Hart said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need, I can make it myself if I want to drink it," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you planning to argue with me in the kitchen the whole time?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish her sentence, he had already walked up to her, picked her up and carried her to the couch, placing her gently on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait here, you'll feel better soon. Be good," he said, standing up straight and walking back to the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller sat on the couch in a daze, staring at his back as he walked away. Even though they had broken up, he still treated her the same way he did when they were together. How was she supposed to keep her distance from him like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a quarter of an hour, he walked up to her with a freshly brewed cup of ginger and brown sugar water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's still hot, be careful when you drink it," he said, handing her the cup carefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took the cup and looked at the steaming brown sugar water, murmuring, "You don't have to do these things for me." This tenderness and care only made it harder for her to let go of her feelings for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You think it's unnecessary because we've broken up?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mm-hmm," she replied softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if we've broken up, I can still be good to you," he said. "Valda Theller, do you know? I want to be good to you, whether or not you're carrying my child, whether or not we've broken up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at him in a daze, watching as he knelt down slowly in front of her.</p></div>
