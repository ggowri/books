        <h1>Chapter 4120</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, no problem!" Kit readily agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina turned the camera towards Kit, who greeted Eugenia on the other end of the video, "Hello Eugenia, nice to see you again, I remember you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia immediately showed an extremely happy expression!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oh my god, Kit remembers her! Her efforts in being a fan weren't in vain! "Kit, keep up the good work! I have confidence in you and I'll promote your new drama as much as I can at school!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you!" Kit smiled and said, "But I'm a bit busy today, I still have to continue filming. If there's a chance next time, I'll treat you and Tina to a meal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia's expression was even more exaggerated, "Eat a meal together...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, you wouldn't refuse, would you?" Kit said, but his gaze went beyond the phone screen and towards Tina, who was holding the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was also surprised, she didn't expect Kit to take the initiative to invite them to eat together in the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or maybe... it was just a polite remark?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course we'll accept!" Eugenia said excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In no time, Kit left the nanny car to continue filming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the time filming was over, it was already several hours later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me take you back now." Kit said, "What about your friend, do you want me to drop her off too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, no need. I've already sent my driver to take her home," Tina said. She regretted not knowing earlier that Kit was planning to take Eugenia home, or else she would have asked Eugenia to wait a bit longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina wondered if Eugenia would be angry with her if she found out about this tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the nanny car slowly left the film and television city, Kit asked casually, "You and your friend are very close?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah," Tina smiled. "Eugenia is a lovely person and very sincere to others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How long have you known her?" Kit asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"More than two years," Tina replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Such a short time... You seem to be very trusting of people," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I'm not the type to easily trust others," Tina muttered, then thought for a moment and said, "I should say I trust my instincts."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Instincts?" he was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, instincts. Like who can become a friend and who can only have shallow conversations. In this regard, my instincts are pretty accurate!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, how does your instinct view me?" he asked, his beautiful black eyes staring straight at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was taken aback. Kit's gaze at this moment seemed to contain something else, making her unable to understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think you're a pretty good person, hardworking, pure, and honest!" Tina smiled and said, shaking off the doubts in her heart. "You're also talented and good-looking, and your songs are great, so that's why I decided to become your fan!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" Kit smiled faintly. "I'm happy to have a fan like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pure and honest? He looked at her smiling face, and it seemed that her instincts were not always accurate after all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, he's not pure or upright! He's just trying hard to make himself more "valuable".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because the more valuable a person is, the less likely they are to be abandoned!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car drove up to the Stephenson family's door, which had a security system and was in a wealthy area. The reporters never dared to do anything at the Stephenson family's door!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Tina got out of the car, she unexpectedly saw Chandler at the Stephenson family's door!</p></div>
