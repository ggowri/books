        <h1>Chapter 4404: Not Friends</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? Well, I'm quite upset then," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was taken aback, abruptly lifting his head to look at the other person. "You're upset?" Had he answered something incorrectly again?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's pretty sad. You say you like me, but it seems like you wouldn't be upset if I rejected you. It's as if your affection for me is just casual, just a nonchalant liking. That's why you wouldn't be upset even if you were rejected!" Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's face was a mix of red and white, "No... that's not it, my feelings for you have never been casual, I just... just..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stammered, but his voice got stuck once again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just didn't want to end up not even being able to be friends with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm going to ask you one last time, if I reject you, are you really not going to be upset?" Harley asked seriously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert looked at the person in front of him. This time, he seemed to have made up his mind and answered truthfully, "Yes, and it will be very painful, probably unbearable. But... even so, I... I still want to stay by your side, just to watch you quietly. It's enough if you can occasionally talk to me. I don't want to end up as strangers just because I confessed my feelings for you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he continued speaking, his voice choked with emotion. His eyes were incredibly red, as if the mist in them could turn into tears at any moment, ready to flow down his cheeks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley looked at Calvert, feeling a surge of emotions in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't dislike Calvert saying he liked her, in fact... she was even somewhat accepting of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, when he says that he'd be devastated if she rejected him, she might even feel... happy?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His reddened eyes and slightly trembling body made her feel pity and heartache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be... she has different feelings for him? Feelings that go beyond friendship, for him...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley, please don't hate me, okay?" Calvert mumbled, choking back tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thump! Thump! Thump!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley found his heart suddenly pounding faster.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this what they call love at first sight?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once, she had feelings for Lornell, you could even say she loved him deeply. But that affection and love, accumulated over the months of this year, gradually formed into a habit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After breaking off her engagement with Lornell, she didn't think she'd fall in love with anyone else anytime soon. After all, it wouldn't be easy to find another person in this world who could make her heart flutter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, that person must be honest and kind, not approaching her deliberately because of her family background, but simply liking her for who she is.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this vast sea of humanity, what are the odds of us meeting?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, has she encountered it?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't hate you," Harley began, "And when you said you liked me, I was actually very happy. But Calvert, I've broken off an engagement before, so if I were to start another relationship, I would be more cautious. I don't want to reject you, but right now, I can't make any promises to you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert listened, his eyes slowly widening, as if he couldn't quite believe what he was hearing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can... Can I still stay by your side, as... as a friend?" Calvert asked, his voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not just friendship," Harley said. "I want to see what it would be like to be with you. So, can we try to be more than friends first? If it doesn't work out, we can always go back to being friends."</span></p></div>
