        <h1>Chapter 2023</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If he did star in a gay drama, then... she felt that her nose was about to bleed just thinking about it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why are you blushing?" asked Grace as she looked at her best friend's flushed face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"N-Nothing." Lina quickly got rid of the blush on her face and said to her best friend, "Let's wait here for a while. Let's ask for an autograph or something when they finish filming. I'm sure they'll say yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I think so too," said Grace. Although the drama Old Friends was getting popular, it was only a niche genre, after all. Besides, the two actors were rookies, so they probably would not reject fans who asked them for autographs or something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Especially when her best friend was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But I'm afraid it's going to take them a while to wrap up. Are you just going to wait here? Aren't you tired?" Grace said with some concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "Nope. It's kinda interesting to watch them shoot!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After watching for a while, Lina could not help crying out, "Wow, are they filming a breakup scene? Gosh, they're gonna break up in the sequel!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Gosh, I'll probably cry if I watch this episode on TV."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Wow, they have a crying scene. I really want to get closer to watch it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina rambled on. Then she dragged Grace along until she was stopped by the film crew's security guards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A few fans were also trying to get closer to the film set, so the security guards pushed a little harder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Watch out!" Grace hurried to protect Lina, worried about her pregnant best friend getting hurt. However, she was accidentally pushed to the side and was about to fall. Someone helped Grace in time, and then someone came forward to protect Lina, separating those fans and security guards from Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Suddenly, Lina and Grace were the ones being protected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Madam, are you okay?" The bodyguard's voice rang in Grace's ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She looked at the person in front of her, who was the Reed family's bodyguard. It was unsurprising that she had bodyguards secretly protecting her. After all the danger she had been in, Jay had gotten people to secretly protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She looked at the faces of those who were now guarding her best friend. They were unfamiliar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"They're..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"They're the Stephenson family's bodyguards. Mr. Stephenson is having them secretly protect Miss Sweeney to keep her safe," the bodyguard next to Grace replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How do you know that? Do you know each other?" Grace asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We... We&rsquo;ve been bumping into each other a lot recently because of our work. We occasionally talk to each other, so I kinda know what's going on," the bodyguard replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace met Lina once or twice a week, so their bodyguards often ran into each other and would sometimes have a chat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked at the bodyguards in front of her in shock after hearing that. "Hadwin... sent you?"</p></div>
