        <h1>Chapter 2709</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled. "I wished the newlyweds a happy marriage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How boring." He commented.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled and said nothing, but the priest then said, "The groom may now kiss the bride."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla suddenly turned sideways, wrapped her hands around Martin Weiss's neck, stood on tiptoes, and pressed her lips to his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss froze. There was a flicker of mixed emotion in his eyes. Suddenly, the memory of him and her coming to the church flashed through his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was smiling as she wrapped her arms around his neck and said, "Martin, why don't we have our wedding in this church someday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's your call," he said. It was only a casual assent at the time because he did not think he would ever marry her at all. He only approached her to get revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she smiled contentedly at his answer. "Thank you!" she said happily before kissing him on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was now kissing him on the lips in the same way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her gentle lips pressed on his slightly cool lips, making his Adam's apple roll. A certain desire seemed to rise in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It took all his self-control to suppress that desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop! Stop it! 'Martin Weiss shouted desperately in his head. His self-control was shattered by her simple kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If this went on... he probably would not be able to last much longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to push her away, but his body was so stiff that he could not even push her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Martin Weiss's arms could not help wanting to embrace her, Kyla's lips finally left his. It also quickly brought his sanity back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He withdrew his hands stiffly, feeling glad that he had not embraced her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;That was close... Maybe I'm close to surrendering.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's red lips gently uttered two words, "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He froze. It was the same words she had said when she kissed him in the church back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you... thanking me?" he asked hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because you didn't push me away," she said. The kiss seemed to have brought her back to the age when she was carefree and thought romance was beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, time was the most ruthless thing in the world. It would not return after it was gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come on," she said as she turned around to walk out the church exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pressed his thin lips tightly and followed Kyla out of the church.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where next?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're getting lunch at the restaurant we used to go to. I looked it up online, and it's still around," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The restaurant from ten years ago was still around. When they arrived at the restaurant, there were not many people inside, and it had many empty seats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two sat down at a table, and Kyla nostalgically looked through the menu. Many of the dishes on the menu were still the same as she remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She ordered some dishes she remembered. Then, she asked Martin Weiss, "What about you? What else do you want?"</p></div>
