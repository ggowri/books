        <h1>Chapter 1460</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace came to the stairway, she happened to see Jason's figure. However, she also saw Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What is... Brian doing here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as Grace was about to go downstairs, she heard Brian say, "I didn't expect Grace's case to have something to do with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace instantly stopped in her tracks. The words she just heard made her breathing constrict.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What does Brian mean... by that? Jay has something to do with my case? Hasn&rsquo;t my case with the car accident been closed? Haven't they found the real perpetrator?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Is that what you wanted to talk about?" Jason's voice rang out faintly as if he was nonchalant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian continued saying, "That Dexter Rios was just a pawn. You knew who it was who wanted to hurt Grace, but you kept turning a blind eye to it. Why? Was it just for the minor benefits you'd get from the Atkinson family? You ruined Grace's whole life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes darkened. "It seems that Old Master Reed had indeed kept something up his sleeve. Did you learn all this from him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Someone just sent me an anonymous email with all the files of Grace's case attached, as well as the tunneling between the Reed family and the Atkinson family after the case!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It must be because of the Reed family and the Atkinson family's joint development project in the West, Wanjia City. If the truth of the car accident were exposed, it would have been an inconcealable scandal for the Atkinson family and would also cause great losses to the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It was a joint development project, and the interest was 50% in proportion to the investment. But after Grace's imprisonment, the Atkinson family transferred 20% of their interest to Reed Group. Why was that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian had clearly done some research and spoke aggressively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's original nonchalant expression turned gloomy. His dark eyes stared at the person in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What is your purpose in coming here to talk about this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Let me just ask you, are you really going to give Grace justice?" Brian asked grimly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm giving Grace justice right now," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian suddenly sneered. "Your so-called justice is just to destroy the Atkinson family and the Stevens family, but the real perpetrator is still unpunished. Grace doesn't even know that the real perpetrator was Lily, the Atkinson family's second heiress and Sean's fianc&eacute;e!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes turned darker while Grace, who was at the stairway on the second floor, froze when she heard the name Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Lily was... the real perpetrator?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Lily, the woman who kept going on about getting revenge for her sister, Jennifer, in prison? And Jay... knew about it? He knew from the beginning that Lily was the real perpetrator?'</p></div>
