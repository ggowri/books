        <h1>Chapter 716</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had just let go of her hand when Brian&rsquo;s hand grabbed hers in the next moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who the hell are you?" His intense phoenix eyes were as sharp as a sword, trying to cut her open for a closer look!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned, and Jason's hand had already grabbed Brian's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let go!" Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not care about Jason. His phoenix eyes were still fixed on Grace. "Who the hell are you?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a flash of rage in Jason's eyes. Then, he pressed hard with his fingertips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">An ordinary person would have let go by now, but Brian clung to Grace's hand as if he were trying to hold on to the most important thing in his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a suffocating atmosphere in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three's unusual state had already caught passersby's attention, many of who recognized Jason and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men, who held sway in Emerald City, were now having a dispute over a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, a scene like this would make people curious and surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay saw what happened when she came out of the bathroom to look for Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The moment she heard Brian asking Grace, "Who the hell are you?", Stella Lindsay only felt as if her heart was about to stop. A chill rose from the soles of her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why did Brian ask Grace that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian keeps holding Grace's hand even though Jason is trying to pull him away. Brian refuses to let go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why the hell is that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay's mind was filled with questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she hurried forward and said, "Brian, what's the matter? Why are you holding Grace's hand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, no one paid her any attention. The three looked at each other while Stella Lindsay looked like an outsider.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was immediately overwhelmed with embarrassment, especially when so many people were watching them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm Grace," a clear voice replied Brian. "Mr. Hart, can you let go now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not let go. "Why did you say that... Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know what you're talking about." Grace frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You said you won't let go. You said you'll take me up there and that I must hold on to you!" Brian's usual cold voice was so eager right now. "Why did you say so?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened. 'The little girl in my dreams... Said these to the little boy. Did I... Say them out loud just now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I was just having a headache and was dazed by the pain, so I said something that even I don't know myself. Maybe I was afraid of falling and grabbed you, but I accidentally said the opposite," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is that so?' Brian pressed his thin lips together tightly, but his heart was still full of doubt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, I'll say this for the last time, let go! Otherwise, don't blame me for breaking your hand!" Jason's voice was harsh. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no doubt that a man like him would keep his word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian was unwilling to let go just like that. He felt that if he let go now, he would lose something important.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, what's the matter? No matter what Grace has said, you don't have to keep holding on like this. Are you really going to have your hand broken?" Stella Lindsay said hastily.</p></div>
