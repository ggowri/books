        <h1>Chapter 2223</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Same as her," Martin Weiss said to the lady boss, who was also the cashier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright," the lady boss answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two walked over to a small dining table. Kyla looked at Martin Weiss's hand and said, "Keep an eye on your hand these days. Don't let your small injury turn into a big one like what the doctor said."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I will," he answered like an obedient child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two bowls of noodles with pork chops soon arrived. Kyla lowered her head to eat while Martin Weiss looked at the woman in front of him. He recalled back to the time when they had noodles together. She had smiled and said, "Martin, why don't I learn how to make noodles? That way, I can make you a bowl of longevity noodles on your birthday. You can live to an old age in peace." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you believe that?" he asked with a chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I would rather believe it!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to go out of your way to do it. Just buy some longevity noodles in the supermarket and boil them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But homemade noodles are more sincere. I'll make them for you for every birthday from now on. And you&rsquo;ll live a safe and healthy life. Our children and I are counting on you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She trusted him with all her heart at the time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the end, he did not manage to eat the longevity noodles she made. An opportunity like that had become a luxury he could not afford. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could she and their children still count on him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why aren't you eating?" Just then, Kyla's voice rang out. He came back to his senses and happened to meet her puzzled eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just had a little flashback. I... I'll start eating now." With that said, he lowered his head and devoured the noodles in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would become someone she and their children could count on! He would keep them safe even if he had to sacrifice his life! He would make all the necessary preparations so that she and the children would have a good life even if something happened to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After their meal, Martin Weiss asked the driver to send Kyla home. "I won't get into the car so that you'll be less afraid. Kyla, I know that no matter what I say or do, I can't fix things. After all, what's done is done! Maybe the best I can do is make you a little less afraid of me. All I want in this life is for you to be okay and safe. I'm not expecting anything else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He muttered inwardly, 'Yes, I'm not expecting anything. I'm not expecting another chance to spend my whole life with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Or that she&rsquo;ll fall for me again.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He no longer had the right to these things after what had happened that year. It was all the more reason he should not be anticipating them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla felt a pang in her heart. When Martin Weiss said he was &lsquo;not expecting anything else&rsquo;, she felt something pressing against her chest. It made her a little breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face was still so pale under the street lights. The eyes looking at her were filled with love, pain, regret, and... despair. </p></div>
