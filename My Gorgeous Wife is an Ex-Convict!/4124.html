        <h1>Chapter 4122</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked at her angry expression. "But if you really want to leave me, do you know how painful it would be for you if I don't let go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">If it really came to that point, if he really used extreme means to keep her by his side, she would probably collapse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I don't care!" Tina said. "I want you to say that! Because I will never leave you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because she believed that her feelings for him would never change!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler laughed, even though he didn't agree with her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But it seemed that she always had a strange ability to calm his unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The unease he felt when he saw Kit bring her back slowly dissipated because of her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you very angry?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, you have to say it like I want you to, then I won't be angry. So, say it quickly!" She stood with her hands on her hips, staring at him with wide eyes, a look that made him think of a cute little hamster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler's eyelashes trembled slightly. Anyway, he just didn't want to make her angry. Since she didn't like him giving her the choice, he wouldn't mention it in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Anyway, no matter what choice she makes in the future, he will accept it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay, I..." Chandler was about to say what Tina wanted to hear when suddenly Tina shouted, "Wait!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I need to add something else," Tina said. "You also need to say that if I dare to leave you, you will cry, cry hard, not be able to eat or sleep every day, hold onto my thighs, and beg me not to leave!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler was stunned. Not being able to eat or sleep was not a problem, but crying... um, how long has it been since he cried hard?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Or should he say, has he ever cried hard from childhood to adulthood?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">In addition, hold onto her thighs? In his memory, even when he was very young, he never held onto an adult's thighs!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Okay, you can say it now!" Tina put on a waiting expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler was sweating profusely. Well, as long as it was what she wanted, he could do it for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For example... saying these embarrassing words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Even if you want to leave me, I won't let you go. I will... cry hard, not be able to eat or sleep every day, and hold onto your thighs, begging you not to leave me..." Chandler almost used all his strength to restrain his embarrassment and said the words Tina specified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he finished speaking, he secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This should be enough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But in the next second, the breath he had just let out was taken away again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina's voice suddenly rang out, "Oh my god, Chandler, what did you just say? Is Tina leaving you? No way, don't cry yet, let me ask Tina!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler's body immediately became incredibly stiff. He turned around and saw his future in-laws standing at the entrance to the living room, looking at him with surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And from what he heard from his future mother-in-law, they also heard what he just said!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Chandler finally felt so embarrassed that he wanted to dig a hole in the ground with his toes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For the first time since birth, he was so embarrassed that he didn't even know what to say!</p></div>
