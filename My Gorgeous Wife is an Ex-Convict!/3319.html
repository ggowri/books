        <h1>Chapter 3317</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go ask them? Ask them for what? Look at these past few days, have they let you go and accompany their daughter to play the piano? Last time when Jasper heard those words, the Reed family now looks at our family as if we are filthy, where would they still help us!" Wilona said irritably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She really hates the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for the Reed family refusing to help her repay the money and even saying they had no relation to their family, how could she not borrow from loan sharks?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go ask Jasper for help, she'll help me!" Lawrence said anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Reed family clearly won't help us, what are you dreaming about?" Wilona said angrily. "Everyone outside knows that the Reed family has kicked us out. I told you to please Jasper, but what happened? You didn't please her and let her hear a few more words, and now she's unhappy with our family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona blamed all the mistakes on others, but never thought about her own problems.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence lowered his head and tightly pulled his clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That day, Jasper left so sadly, he really wanted to stop her, but he didn't dare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's been so many days, and Jasper hasn't come to see him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the piano teacher told him he could continue taking lessons there, he couldn't learn with Jasper anymore because their schedules conflicted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, does Jasper really not want to learn piano with him anymore or listen to him play?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, hurry up and go clean up for me!" Wilona impatiently yelled at her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence slowly walked back to his room and began packing his things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He is now leaving with his parents from here. He heard his parents say that they are leaving Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So when will he be able to see Jasper again in the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He thought for a long time, and finally hesitated for a moment. Then he took out paper and a pen, wrote a letter, and placed it on the desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He hopes that in the future, if Jasper comes back to find him and sees this letter, she will be willing to forgive him and understand that his sudden departure was not by choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he grows up, he will be able to support himself and do things according to his own wishes. He won't have to stay if he doesn't want to, but leaving will be his only option.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After packing up their belongings, Lawrence left home with his parents and took a taxi to the train station. Along the way, Wilona and Doran looked nervous, as if they were afraid of encountering debt collectors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Lawrence just kept his head down, holding in his arms the gift that Jasper had given him - a small house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "This is 'home'."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For him, that was his fondest memory ever, so even though he had to flee Emerald City with his parents, and even though the toy was not easy to carry, he still insisted on taking the little house with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, he heard his mother's exclamation, "What's going on? We're supposed to be heading to the train station, why are you driving this way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is a shortcut, there won't be as much traffic," replied the driver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the direction the driver was heading in was becoming increasingly off course, heading towards a sparsely populated area, completely opposite to the direction of the train station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The couple Wilona exchanged a glance, both with a look of unease in their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop the car, we're getting off here!" said Doran.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this time, the driver didn't answer them. Instead, he drove the car even faster!</p></div>
