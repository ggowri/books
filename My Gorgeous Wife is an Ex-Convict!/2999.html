        <h1>Chapter 2997</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taylah quickly changed the subject, "Valda, did you come alone today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, my boyfriend will be here soon," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, that's a coincidence. Linda's boyfriend is also coming soon. He's a rising director. You can show him your comics. If he likes them, you might even get some of them adapted into TV shows!" Taylah said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Taylah seemed to be introducing Linda's boyfriend, she was actually mocking Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda, however, didn't show any change in expression and continued to answer questions from the students in the comic club.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Soon, a man in his early thirties wearing clothes with a big brand logo walked over and greeted Linda and Taylah.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Linda took the opportunity to say, "Valda, this is my boyfriend Fynn. He's a young director who is highly regarded in the industry. If you really want your comics to be adapted into TV shows, you can talk to him. If he's interested, you'll be lucky."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Comics?" Fynn frowned when he heard this. "Linda, don't recommend me any random comics. I have several scripts to choose from. I don't have time to read these kinds of comics."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fynn's words hit the nail on the head. As his girlfriend, Linda knew that Fynn had high standards. Unless the comics were well-known, why would he be interested in adapting them into TV shows?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Linda was waiting to see Valda's embarrassed expression, but Valda seemed indifferent. It was the students in the comic club who looked like they wanted to speak up for Valda, but they were too afraid to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I draw comics, but I never thought that my comics must be made into a movie or TV show," said Valda. Then she turned to the students and said, "Okay, let's continue with the questions we had earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can't taste the grapes, so you say they're sour." Taylah chimed in to help Linda retort against Valda. "Saying that you never thought about turning your comics into a movie or TV show, when in reality, there's no director to make it happen!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who said that? Valda has already finished filming a TV series based on a comic book, and the male lead is still Baron!" said a girl who couldn't help but speak up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fynn, on the other hand, looked disdainful. "Baron is really something else. He actually went and made a live-action adaptation of this manga. It's like he's lowering his own status."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, and it's only one manga adaptation. They really think they're lucky enough to have consecutive adaptations?" Taylah chimed in, "Maybe in this lifetime, this is the only manga adaptation they'll get."</p></div>
