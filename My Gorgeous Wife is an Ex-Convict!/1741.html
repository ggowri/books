        <h1>Chapter 1739</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The security guard hesitated but still insisted and said, "Sorry, Young Madam. If we let you in, we won't be able to give Young master Reed an explanation!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll explain it to him, so you don't have to. I can assure you that nothing will happen to you!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No matter how Grace persuaded them, the security guards still refused and the mansion's iron gates continued to block their way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was anxious. She was getting more worried and anxious with every passing minute and second!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The situation with Jay's memory loss made it unsuitable for him to undergo hypnosis treatment. If they rashly hypnotized him, he would only... break down!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Open the gates! Open the gates now! None of you will be let off the hook if anything happens in there!" Grace threatened, but the security guards still would not do anything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If this went on, she would not be able to get in even after a few hours! Grace frowned. She had tried calling Jay on her way here, but his phone was turned off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She made up her mind and went straight back to the car. However, she got into the driver's seat this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She... had not driven a car in years, even in the five years she lost her memory. She would feel scared whenever she held the steering wheel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She never understood why before this. However, she understood after recovering her memory!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The accident and the subsequent fall into the sea had made her scared to drive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she was going to enter the mansion one way or another!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jay, Jay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She wanted to know how he was doing. She was afraid that if she just foolishly waited outside, she would regret it for the rest of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace took a deep breath, turned the car key, and started the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence immediately understood what Grace was trying to do when he saw this. He quickly said to the security guard, "Hurry! Hurry and open the gates! Young Madam's going to crash into the gates with the car!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What?" The security guards seemed dumbfounded. They thought Terrence was joking at first but panicked when they saw Grace driving toward the iron gates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Open the gates! Do you know how important Young Madam is to Young master Reed? If anything happens to her, forget about your jobs, everyone here will probably be dead meat!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">One of the security guards hurriedly took out the remote control and pressed the button to open the iron gates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace drove into the mansion right as the iron gates opened. When she pulled up to the main house, her limbs felt weak and her palms were covered with cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She almost staggered out of the car and ran into the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence also came running over and followed Grace inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was no one in sight, and everything seemed quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you know which room Jay is in?" Grace asked in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence shook his head. "We can only search one room at a time if there's no other way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as he finished speaking, there was suddenly a roar of pain from inside one of the rooms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace shuddered. This sound was... "Jay!"</p></div>
