        <h1>Chapter 1608</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The child was about the same age as Jasper and Mick, but he was leading such a difficult life in that family. That child had beaten up other children today. She wondered what had happened to him in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? What's on your mind?" Jason's voice rang in Grace's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I thought of the boy I saw during the day, the one who beat up others in the restaurant's playground. I wonder how his family will punish him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Are you worried about the child?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah." She nodded. "Maybe it's because the look on that child's face today reminded me of the first time I saw you, so I unconsciously care about him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Does he look like me?" Jason raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The look in his eyes and his expression reminds me of you. There's a hollow look in the boy's eyes. It's not an expression a child should have, but he cares about his sister. If the other boy had not pushed his sister, he wouldn't have hit them," she said as she told him what she saw today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?" Jason's eyes flickered a little and he said, "He has a Sis he cares about, and I... have a Sis I care about too." His life would have been different if he had not met her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would never even have known what it was like to love someone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Since you care so much about the child, I'll talk to my men and have them check with the amusement park to find the family. We&rsquo;ll straighten things out so they won't give the child a hard time because of the fight," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace breathed a sigh of relief when she heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace had gone to bed at night, Jason opened his eyes and slowly sat up. He fell into a trance as he looked at the woman who was sound asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So what if you're my weakness? Even if someone uses you do threaten me one day, I still won't let you kill yourself no matter what!" he muttered as though he was making an oath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What answered him was the sound of her even breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Maybe it's just like what you said. It's best if that day never comes..." Before he could finish talking, there was a throbbing pain in his head as though something flashed across his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason suddenly froze. What flashed across his mind was the image of a cliff by the sea. Something seemed to fall off it and then he heard himself crying out in despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Ah!" He gasped suddenly and pressed one hand against his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What was that suffocating feeling?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His heartbeat became unusually fast, but the only blessing was that the headache only lasted a moment. It was fast! The images that flashed across his mind were quick too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They were so quick that he only saw the cliff!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he remembered the cliff. It was the cliff where Grace had fallen into the sea. Terrence had said that Grace could not accept the truth of the case no matter what and went there when she left. Then, she accidentally fell into the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Terrence and the rest have no idea why Grace went there. She... also lost that part of her memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But if I was the one who shouted, does that mean... I was at the seaside too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why hadn't Terrence ever mentioned to me that I was at the seaside as well?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What on earth happened? Was it really just an accident that Grace fell into the sea?&rsquo;</p></div>
