        <h1>Chapter 1291</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn hugged her son and said, "You know what? You matter the most to me. I don't care what others say about me, but I'll be sad if you get hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one nodded with determination in his eyes. "I won't make you sad anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn smiled gently and touched her son's tender little cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The interaction between the pair of mother and son gave others a warm feeling. Martin Weiss was a little lost in thought at the sight of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had never thought of her as a mother before, but now, he was witnessing her playing her role as a mother with his own eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His mind flashed back to the time she had said with a smile, "When we have kids, you'll probably be the kind of father who&rsquo;s strict.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you?" he had asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Me? Probably a loving mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you ever heard that a loving mother would foster a useless child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A loving mother like me will make a good mother. I'll teach my child well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know how well she taught him, but at least he knew that she was a good mother to her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Kyla Corbyn frowned and her expression changed. Then, she said to the little one, "Nelson, talk to Daddy while I go to the washroom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Kyla Corbyn turned around and walked toward the washroom at the end of the corridor. One of her hands subconsciously covered the upper part of her right abdomen while she made her way there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes could not help narrowing as he looked at Kyla Corbyn's back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn gasped heavily for air after entering the washroom. Her right hand was pressed hard on the right side of her abdomen, enduring the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since a few months ago, she would sometimes suffer a dull pain at that spot, but it would subside in a while. However, the pain had worsened the last few times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pain finally subsided after a while, and Kyla Corbyn let out a sigh of relief. She looked up, feeling completely exhausted. She looked at her pale face and the beads of sweat on her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Maybe I'm just too exhausted,' she thought to herself. However, she would hold on for Nelson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn walked out of the washroom after washing her face with clean water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened to you?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said lightly, "Nothing. Thank you for the hearing aid. I'll take Nelson home first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pressed his thin lips together. "I'll send all of you home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll send all of you home!" Martin Weiss said without giving her room for rejection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Kyla Corbyn did not say anything more and let Martin Weiss send her and her son back to the entrance of the neighborhood where they lived. Then, she took her son's hand and got out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one politely waved to Martin Weiss and said, "Goodbye, Daddy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss subconsciously waved and said, "Goodbye." He was a little stunned after doing that. It seemed he had not waved goodbye to anyone like this for a long time.</p></div>
