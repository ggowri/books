        <h1>Chapter 658</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at Jason. After a while, she said, "If so, I guess I&rsquo;ve gone through so many things probably&hellip; Just to meet you and fall in love with you too. If I hadn't gone through all these ups and downs, maybe I wouldn't have anything to do with you at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had it not been for her imprisonment, she might have married Sean and remained a lawyer. However, she might still be unable to blend in with the Stevens family after marriage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, it was also possible that she did not marry Sean because of his parents' objections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In any case, she would not have met Jason that night while in such a mess and neither would she have brought him home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She and he would eventually miss each other like two parallel lines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyelashes quivered a little. Then, he gently hugged Grace, buried his face deep in her neck, and sniffed the scent of her body. "Yes, you... Must have gone through all that to meet me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not know that he had caused her some of the pain she went through. Had he felt a little compassion or kindness for her, she would not have suffered this fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not even have to suffer three years in jail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt Jason's arms shaking as he hugged her. "What's wrong? Is it cold?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's a little cold," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I get a blanket for you?" After all, the night wind was a little cool, and according to the rules of keeping vigil at night, the door of the room needed to be kept open. As such, gusts of cold wind kept blowing in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace spoke, she tried to get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason only held Grace tightly in his arms. "I don't need a blanket. Just hold me for a minute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His mutters sounded like what a spoiled child would say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace somehow found Jason acting like a child who was seeking some kind of comfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised her hands and hugged him gently. "Is it not cold this way, Jay?" Her voice, as gentle as her actions, sounded like a voice from heaven.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason gently nudged Grace's neck. "Yes, it's not cold anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only she could give him peace of mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once, he thought that he was not bothered by the cold. He would not feel as cold even if he was in the snow and there was ice in his thin clothes. Even if his blood turned cold, he would not die from it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every night on the anniversary of his father's death, he would sit in the same spot where his father had died and wonder if he would freeze to death like his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Staying alive meant nothing to him. He could die without a care.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her embrace gave him a warm feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People would fear the cold when they had experienced warmth, and at the same time, they would also yearn for more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like how he yearned for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Outside the window on the other side of the room, a figure was staring blankly at the two people in the room who were embracing each other.</p></div>
