        <h1>Chapter 1795</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a long while, Lina finally heard Hadwin Stephenson's voice from the phone. "Are you thinking of aborting the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I'm just saying," she said timidly. She did not know why she was scared when she heard Hadwin Stephenson ask that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if it was a heinous thing to abort the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Anyway, hurry and send someone to take all these things back," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you so scared of your parents finding out you're pregnant?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She snapped, "How am I not supposed to be scared? I'm a single woman who got pregnant. Do you think it's a glorious matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her parents were quite conservative. If they found out about it, she would be punished to kneel on a washboard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then if we get married, your parents won't scold you, right?" asked Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Get... Get married?" Lina's jaw dropped. Although she had thought about it, she did not expect Hadwin Stephenson to mention it so quickly. He even did it... on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If we get married, isn't having kids something just and honorable?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina froze. Her nose suddenly felt sore when she heard that. She remembered how she had asked him previously what they would do if she got pregnant. His answer was still the same!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, do you think I should marry you just because you said so? You can't even get my parents' blessing, so why make it sound so simple? Do you know how much my parents hate you after we broke up?" Her voice broke, and she ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What happened back then was not only her sore spot but also her parents&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her parents naturally felt betrayed when he broke up with her at her lowest when he was supposed to be someone she could rely on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her parents were so sincere to him, thinking that he would become the son-in-law of the Sweeney family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina sat on the bed and sobbed. Even if she tried hard to stop the tears, it was to no avail!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if all the pent-up emotions within her had exploded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she went to work the next day, she had two panda-like dark circles around her eyes. The sight of her set off a flurry of speculation among her colleagues.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she was about to get off work, Anthony Sherman texted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anthony Sherman: [I'll pick you up after work and take you to GB's concert.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina instantly froze. There were so many things going on lately that she had forgotten about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she heard that GB's concert was being held in Emerald City, she wanted to attend but could not get a ticket at all. It slipped out of her mouth when she was having dinner with Anthony Sherman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Who knew that two days later, Anthony Sherman told her that he had gotten the tickets and invited her to GB's concert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had been looking forward to the concert. After all, GB was her favorite group. The five handsome men were such eye candy. However, she was preoccupied with her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at Anthony Sherman's text message, Lina hesitated before replying with an &lsquo;Okay&rsquo;. After all, she had to come clean with some things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When it was time to get off work, Lina went downstairs and saw Anthony Sherman's car parked across the street. She walked over and got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We have two hours before the concert, so why don't we get something to eat first?" asked Anthony Sherman.</p></div>
