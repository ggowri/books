        <h1>Chapter 1317</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn followed Martin Weiss to the living room of the suite. He stopped, turned around, and stared at her coldly. "You came and said something about accepting my request. What's the matter? Are you going to give up Nelson's custody?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Kyla Corbyn's mouth gently uttered the word. However, when she said the word, she felt as if her soul was trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The &lsquo;yes&rsquo; made Martin Weiss's brows furrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He ought to be happy that she was willing to give up custody of Nelson because it would spare him the time and effort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, for some reason, he was not happy at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you really going to give up custody?" He narrowed his eyes and stared at her sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn smiled bitterly. "Isn't me giving up custody what you want? But I hope you can promise me two things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her wry smile was particularly glaring to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, shoot," he said as he sat on the couch nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"First off, I hope you can raise Nelson by yourself instead of completely handing Nelson over to Paisley Daniels. Although you're going to be husband and wife and she'll inevitably be involved in raising Nelson, I hope you can listen to Nelson more if there's any conflict. You know my history with Paisley Daniels. She may not be sincere to the child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Paisley isn't the kind of person you imagine her to be. Do you think she'd abuse the child? She said she would treat him like her own," Martin Weiss said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you believe whatever she says?" asked Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's going to be my wife. Why wouldn't I believe her?" he retorted coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn felt a pang in her heart. She was only humiliating herself right now. "Well... If there's any conflict between Nelson and Paisley Daniels in the future, can you let Nelson be with your mother? Let your mother take care of the child instead," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a flicker of confusion in his eyes. "Kyla Corbyn, what are you trying to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just a mother trying to make the best choice for my son. You believe in Paisley Daniels, but I don't," she said as she met his eyes. From her eyes, one could see that she was ready to risk it all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, it was as if she was a fighter who would do anything for her child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pondered for a moment before finally saying, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Secondly, I hope Nelson can stay with me for another three months. After three months, I'll hand him over to you. Nelson will live with you after that, and I won't appear in front of Nelson anymore. I won't affect your family," she continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gaze grew sharper as he stared at her. "What's the matter? Are you not going to appear before Nelson anymore? Are you going to pretend you don't have a son after giving me custody?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since I've handed Nelson to you, it's time for me to pursue a new life too. I'll get married and have other children. I can't possibly tell others that I have a son, can I? It's not good if I tell others that I&rsquo;m single with a child," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a surge of discomfort in his heart. He got up and approached her. "What's the matter? You dared to have children out of wedlock back then, but now you're afraid to tell anyone? I thought you loved the child, but it turns out Nelson is just a burden you can't wait to get rid of in your pursuit of a new life!&rdquo;</p></div>
