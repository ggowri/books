        <h1>Chapter 670</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just here with a friend. If you want to pick out some clothes, you might as well ask the salesgirl for help," Grace said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay embarrassedly looked for a salesgirl to help her choose some clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian walked to Grace's side and said, "Don't be too sad about your grandmother. Everyone is born, gets sick, and dies. Someone in this world will always leave first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up at him. 'Is he... Comforting me?' His lanky body was now clad in a dark graphite gray suit. His handsome face had a placid, indifferent expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The entertainment industry's crown prince was known for his indifference and his behavior of changing one girlfriend after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one knew who the next girlfriend would be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could it be Stella?' Grace suddenly came up with the idea. After all, Brian's previous girlfriends were, by definition, substitutes for Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The real one was now found, and Stella seemed to have divorced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you thinking?" His voice rang out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing," said Grace. There was no need to talk to him about what she was thinking. Besides, it was not her business to know exactly what would happen between him and Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... There were still doubts in her mind. 'What was that dream all about? Does the boy in my dream have anything to do with Brian?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little boy in the dream held the little girl's hand tightly as he fell down the hill. She could still feel the shudder and fear even after she woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a far cry from the indifferent man in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only pressed her lips together slightly before saying. "When you were a child, did someone call you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" he asked. Just then, Stella Lindsay held a bag and in Brian's direction, she asked, "Does this bag look good, Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bag was a limited edition, and she had seen videos of people showing it off online, saying that only the truly rich could buy it. There were a bunch of people bootlicking and complimenting it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had this bag, she could show it off on the internet too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace spat out the word, &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes were subconsciously looking toward Stella Lindsay after hearing her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he heard the word, his body immediately stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His pupils constricted instantly, and his breathing seemed to have stopped suddenly. The word &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo; seemed to have traveled across time and space, coinciding with the sound in his memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at the person in front of him. "What&hellip; Did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I mean, did everyone call you &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo; when you were little?" repeated Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, Brian lunged forward, grabbed her arm, and asked, "Why do you ask? Why are you calling me that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers were so tight that she felt only a pain in her arm and could not help frowning. "I... I was just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing, Brian?" asked Stella Lindsay as she rushed to the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian seemed to have come back to his senses immediately. After seeing Grace's slightly anguished face, his fingers loosened slightly, but he continued to grip her arm.</p></div>
