        <h1>Chapter 2011</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing this, the class teacher said with displeasure on their face, "This is the discipline office. If you&rsquo;re not a parent, please leave. I'll only talk to the parents about this." They were trying to kick Grace, Lina, and Hadwin Stephenson out of the discipline office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really?" Hadwin Stephenson took out his phone, dialed a number, and said to the person on the other end of the line, "I'm Hadwin Stephenson. I'm having some issues here. Please ask the principal of this school to come to the discipline office."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson then gave them the name of the school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The student's mother looked at Hadwin Stephenson like he was a fool. "Who do you think you are? If anyone can just summon the principal, won't the principal be awfully busy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The class teacher also looked angrily at Hadwin Stephenson, only thinking he was here to cause trouble! "Sir, please leave immediately, or I&rsquo;ll call security."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Meanwhile, the student's father was staring at Hadwin Stephenson's face, finding it familiar. Besides, when he made the phone call, he had called himself Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Stephenson...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Suddenly, the eyes of the student's father widened as if he had thought of something incredible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the principal rushed into the discipline office. After looking around the room, they immediately headed toward Hadwin Stephenson. After all, there were only two men there. One was the boy's father, who donated money to the school every year, so the principal knew him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The principal hurried over to Hadwin Stephenson. "You must be Mr. Stephenson. I'm the principal of this school. I'm so sorry. I wonder why you asked me here? Did something happen?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The principal's attitude immediately surprised the class teacher, who hurried forward. "Sir, Mr. Stephenson is..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mr. Stephenson is the president of Stephenson Group. What on earth is going on here?" the principal asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The class teacher immediately turned pale as cold sweat broke out on their forehead. "It's... It&rsquo;s just a misunderstanding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Stephenson Group. Even if the class teacher did not know the name of the president of Stephenson Group, they had heard of the company. The problem was that they did not expect a big shot like that to be here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The student's parents seemed to realize it too. Their faces turned pale and awkward. 'The president of Stephenson Group?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Gosh. How did this happen? Didn&rsquo;t that deaf kid only have a mother who ran a store? How does a woman who runs a store have the president of Stephenson Group backing her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"There was no mistake in what I heard," Hadwin Stephenson said with a half-smile. He told the principal what Lina told him. "My friend's child does have a hearing problem, but your teacher thinks it's okay for parents to discriminate against students with hearing loss. The child did nothing wrong but is being forced to apologize and even at the risk of getting thrown out of the school all because he has a hearing problem. You should know what effect this will have on the school if it's reported in the news."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hearing this, the principal immediately smiled awkwardly. "How is that possible? Our school treats all students equally."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The student's parents also hastened to reply, "It&rsquo;s a misunderstanding. It's just a misunderstanding! It's our child's fault, and we apologize for that. Just tell us how much money you need for your medical expenses. We'll pay you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, the couple immediately grabbed their son and was about to apologize to Nelson Corbyn and Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Nelson Corbyn and Kyla would not accept their apology. Nelson Corbyn even stepped back with a look of rejection on his face.</p></div>
