        <h1>Chapter 4250 Longing</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's going on?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he's going home, he doesn't need to turn off his phone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or is it that he misunderstood something? </span><span>So</span><span> he deliberately avoided her, and even refused to answer her calls?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, Tina couldn't help but bite her lip, a feeling of unease surged in her heart!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She took out her phone and called her mother: "Mom, do you know where the main branch of the Hunter family is? Chandler went back there, and I want to go find him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour later, with a driver arranged by Lina, Tina was escorted to the Hunter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lina originally wanted to accompany her daughter, but Tina said, "I want to go by myself. After all, this is between Chandler and me. If you come with me, it will become a matter between two families."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Lina was worried about her daughter, she admitted that her daughter was right.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadwin, on the other hand, fully agreed with his daughter going to the Hunter family alone: "Since she wants to resolve things between her and Chandler, then let her solve it herself. There are some things we can help with, but there are some things we can't!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina knew that she had been to the main branch of the Hunter family before, but she had no impression of it at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place was unfamiliar to her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the people of the Hunter family all recognized her and immediately welcomed her into the mansion when they saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the </span><span>first person</span><span> Tina saw was the old Mr. Hunter and Chandler's parents, but Chandler himself did not appear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina took out the prepared gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You prepared it with great care," the old Mr. Hunter nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Grandfather, where is Chandler? I came here today specifically to find him," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she didn't have that married feeling yet, in fact, she and Chandler had already obtained a marriage certificate. In the eyes of the law, they were already husband and wife. Moreover, they had a daughter, Quinn, together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So now, Tina called the people in the Hunter family by their family names, just like Chandler did.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler is not convenient to see you right now. I'll have someone arrange a room for you first. You can stay here for a few days, and when Chandler feels convenient, he will naturally meet you," the old Mr. Hunter said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was taken aback, not convenient?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happened to Chandler?" Thinking of Chandler's phone being turned off, Tina asked nervously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's nothing serious. Tina, take a good rest for now. It shouldn't be long before you can see Chandler," the old Mr. Hunter said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina couldn't get any more information even after further questioning, so she had to leave with the servant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She arrived at the room prepared for her by the Hunter family, but it was not Chandler's room, it was a separate guest room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina couldn't tell whether she felt disappointed or relieved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After losing her memory, she met Chandler again. Although they were husband and wife, they had never slept on the same bed. After she left the hospital, she had been living with the Stephenson family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the arrangement of the room by the Hunter family made her feel isolated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She always felt like she didn't fit in with the Hunter family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meanwhile, Chandler, immersed in the potion, was enduring the piercing pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain spread throughout his body, reaching every limb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more intense the pain, the more desire, and longing grew in his heart!</span></p></div>
