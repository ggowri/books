        <h1>Chapter 3219</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the other bedroom, Grace said to Jason, "I saw Lawrence today and he seems like a nice kid, but his parents are a bit..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sycophantic, right?" Jason interrupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can understand their thoughts, after all, Jasper likes the piano that their son plays. If they can get some favor from the Reed family through their son, then their family's life can naturally be improved. Actually, there's nothing wrong with that, but... I hope the child won't be affected." Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She could understand the thoughts of people like the Abbott couple who lived at the bottom of society, but Lawrence, with his clear eyes, she didn't want his clarity to turn into worldliness in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It depends on the child himself." Jason said, he didn't really care about Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do the child's parents do?" Grace asked, she hadn't asked about these details before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"His mother is a cleaner at that hotel, and his father is a transportation worker." Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace pondered for a moment, and Jason said, "If Jasper really gets along with the child later on, then I will arrange another job for his parents, so their family's conditions can naturally be improved."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if things don't go so well?" Grace asked. After all, today was only the first day they met, even though it seemed like Jasper quite liked Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, children are naturally fickle and who knows what the future holds!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it doesn't work out, then it came from somewhere and will go back there," Jason said indifferently. He naturally didn't care about the fate of others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jason, even if these two children don't get along, don't just kick them out right away," said Grace. "Now that we plan to have Lawrence systematically learn piano, and he has a high talent for it, I think even if the two children don't get along in the future, let Lawrence continue to learn piano. Otherwise, it would be a waste of his talent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to properly nurture this child?" Jason raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm just afraid that if this child falls from a high point to a low point again, their mentality will change. I don't want Jasper's actions to make this child's fate worse than before," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason's eyes flickered slightly, then he smiled faintly and said, "Alright, whatever you say, we'll do it that way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace's eyebrows relaxed, "I wonder how Lawrence will turn out in the future. Jasper was also into piano when she was young, so she treats William with special care. Time flies, it's been several years already. It feels like I'll be old soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The older the children get, the older she becomes.</p></div>
