        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She blinked and said, "I'll come to the study with you that night. You can do your work and I'll do my painting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "Don't worry, I still have this ability. It's not like I need you to sit still for me to draw. Besides, when you're working, your movements aren't very big anyway. And, I'm not drawing you to enter a competition or win any awards or anything like that. I just...um, want to draw you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, it's up to you. Just remember that it's just a painting, don't tire yourself out too much," he reminded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After dinner, the couple went to the study together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian was sitting at his desk, working on company matters, while Valda took her sketching pencil and set up an easel in front of the sofa to start drawing a sketch of Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda did not study in the art department at university, but she knew how to sketch. She started drawing comics and then went on to study painting systematically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she has some talent and learns quite quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The teacher who taught her sketching was quite regretful at the time. He said that if she had started drawing since childhood, her achievements now might have been much higher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For Valda herself, it's not actually that regrettable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She just likes to draw, so whether she succeeds or not, she hasn't really thought about it. She feels that if she can make a living doing what she loves, then that's a really good thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And when she finishes a piece of work, she feels a sense of satisfaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This sense of fulfillment is actually more important to her than achievement, in her opinion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, while Valda was drawing, she suddenly said, "Brian, could you please unbutton two buttons on your collar? It doesn't feel casual enough right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian heard Valda's words and looked up at her. Then he raised his hand and began to unbutton the top two buttons of his collar. "Like this?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His graceful movements, combined with his handsome face, created an indescribably charming scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's heart suddenly started beating faster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, falling in love is just like that. It could be because of a certain look, or maybe a certain gesture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda realized that she was really too easily swayed by her dear husband's advances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh? Are you done?" His voice sounded again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" She suddenly snapped out of her daze and realized that she had been staring at him just now. At this moment, he had unbuttoned two buttons of his collar, revealing his beautiful collarbone. However... it seemed like she wanted to see more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She swallowed her saliva and thought for a moment before saying, "How about unbuttoning one more button?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. As Valda wished, he unbuttoned another button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked down again and felt like she wanted to see more. "Can you undo one more button?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want me to untie it?" His eyes flickered slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, remove one more, the casual feeling in the picture will be stronger," she explained her reasoning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do I need to undo all of them?" he asked calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face turned slightly red, "No, it's not necessary. If you could just undo two more buttons, I think that would be enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, as she wished, he undid two more buttons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this good? Are you satisfied?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I'm satisfied," her face turned even redder.</p></div>
