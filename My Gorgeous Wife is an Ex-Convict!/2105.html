        <h1>Chapter 2103</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn was stunned as he looked blankly at his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mommy, you're pregnant?" Nelson asked in confusion. Children at this age only had a vague idea of where babies came from.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla could only say vaguely, "It was an accident. But I hope this baby will be born legally so that people won't criticize them in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson listened with a hazy notion and asked, "Mommy, are you afraid that the baby will be called a bastard?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The word &lsquo;bastard&rsquo; was a word he had heard many times during his childhood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Those people had always looked at him with sorry, pity, or contempt when they said the word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not understand the meaning of the word back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he found out what it meant as he got older.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla felt a pang in her heart when she heard that. She owed so much to her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If... If you can't accept that, then I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn said, "No! Mommy, no matter what you decide, I&rsquo;ll support you. And... I don't want my younger brother or sister to be called a bastard either."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, he looked as if he were hesitant to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? What do you have to say to me?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well... Mommy, are we going to live with Daddy after you two get married?" Nelson Corbyn asked, his little face looking troubled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It seemed he still had a problem with Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "No. We&rsquo;ll only get a marriage license. We're not going to live together. It's just to give the baby a legitimate identity." Of course, that was if Martin Weiss agreed with all this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was a little unsure as she thought about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew that Martin Weiss would probably agree immediately if she wanted to marry him and live with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she was only marrying him to give the baby a legitimate identity so that the child would not be attacked by gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day, Kyla went to the hospital to see Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss seemed to be a little surprised when he saw Kyla, but he hurriedly sat up. "What are you doing here? Did I scare you yesterday? I... I really... But I'm glad you agreed yesterday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The head of Weiss Group, who had never been nervous in front of countless employees, was so nervous that he even stuttered in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, I... will treat you and our children well... I'll do whatever you want me to do!" he stammered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She stared at him. "You'll do whatever I want you to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, I'll do whatever you want. Even if you want me dead!" he said with great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He would give her everything he had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I need you alive, but I need you to marry me," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss froze instantly. His expression froze as if he had heard something unbelievable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Marry? She wants to marry me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His lips quivered as he seemed to speak with all his might. "What... What did you say? Say it again." His eyes were full of longing and hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I said I need you to marry me," Kyla repeated calmly.</p></div>
