        <h1>Chapter 1339</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's pretty eyebrows furrowed. "What the hell do you want to do? Didn't I already give you the agreement? Didn't you also promise that these three months would be my time alone with Nelson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was silent. Even he did not know what he wanted to do! He was restless at the company and kept thinking about the scene from last night, so he impulsively came over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What the hell happened last night? Was it really you who slapped Paisley in the face?" Martin Weiss found an excuse to justify his coming here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn suddenly came to a realization when she heard this. 'Did he come to seek justice for Paisley Daniels?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I did. So are you going to get even with me for Paisley Daniels?" she asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You chose to surrender Nelson's custody. Paisley is willing to treat the child as her own and raise him well. What is there to complain about? Don't you think you went too far by slapping her?&rdquo; Martin Weiss said with a stern face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Too far? I hate it so much that I think a mere slap isn&rsquo;t enough! How can a slap pay for what she has done?" What she hated most was not that she was wrongly imprisoned, but that her imprisonment had caused Nelson to lose his hearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe Nelson would have been a healthy child if she had not been forced to take the cold medicine because of those various incidents!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're so stubborn! Paisley has never owed you anything. But you owe her a life!" Martin Weiss said crossly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn suddenly burst out laughing, and her laughter was getting louder. "Haha... Hahaha..." She kept laughing as if it were the funniest joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face darkened even more, her laughter particularly irritating to his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was still laughing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla Corbyn, I said enough!" Martin Weiss suddenly grabbed her arm and glared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a sudden pain in her arm, and the spot where she had been kicked yesterday was even more painful now that he was grabbing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her expression changed, and a moan escaped her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing this, Martin Weiss was slightly stunned for a moment. Then, he instinctively pulled up her sleeve. Immediately, he could see several bruises on her arm, and it was truly a shocking sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened to your arm?" The words came out of his mouth almost unconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sneered, "You'll have to ask Paisley Daniels. Didn't she enjoy the show last night? I have more wounds on my body. Wanna see? I can show them to you if you want!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She made a gesture to undress as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes grew colder, but an unnoticeable trace of pain flashed in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was slightly alarmed by her actions, but he did not know what he was panicking about. Was he worried he would see more bruises on her body once she took off her clothes?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla Corbyn, you really have no shame. Do you enjoy taking off your clothes in front of men that much?" he said fiercely, trying to hide his panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn seemed indifferent. No matter how vicious Martin Weiss&rsquo;s words were, they could no longer hurt her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, her upper right abdomen started acting up again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn bent over and put her hand over where it hurt. She tried to adjust her breathing and let herself adapt to the pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the very least, she would not show her weak side in front of Martin Weiss. She did not want the man in front of her to see her pain!</p></div>
