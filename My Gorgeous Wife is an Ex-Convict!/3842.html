        <h1>Chapter 3840</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only wanted her to suffer, but he didn't want her dead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Marry me, leave Emerald City with me, and go abroad together!" Lawrence suddenly said. "If you're willing, I can let go of my hatred, and you can make up for your guilt towards me. What do you say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was stunned. She never expected Lawrence to make such a request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you joking about!" she exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I'm joking?" Lawrence replied. "I'm very serious about this, but every time I'm serious with you, you seem to think I'm joking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you want me to marry you, leave Emerald City, all as revenge against me?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think this is revenge?" he asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then what is it? What's the point of doing this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why can't you understand that it's because I love you?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She suddenly widened her eyes, looking at him in disbelief!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he said he hated her, resented her, or even wished she were dead, she could understand, but he said he loved her, and she couldn't understand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps the once innocent and harmless Lawrence had liked her very much. If there had been no twists and turns between them, and they had grown up normally, there was a possibility that he would have fallen in love with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But so many things had happened between them, and he had even lost his family. He had been determined to take revenge on her, and now he said he loved her?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You--" she moved her lips, but her throat was dry, and she didn't know what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, I love you, and even I find that strange," Lawrence leaned closer to Jasper, his fingers hooking under her chin. "So as long as you're willing to make up for your guilt towards me, as I said, I might really be able to let go of my hatred and live a good life with you abroad."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, there was a banging sound at the glass door of the lab.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper wanted to turn her head to look, but Lawrence still held her chin, not letting her turn. "It's Mr. Barlow knocking, but don't worry, this door is made of the highest level of bulletproof glass. Even if Mr. Barlow tries to break it down, he won't be able to."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lawrence, the person I love is not you, so I can't marry you," Jasper said. "I'm sorry, I can find other ways to make up for my guilt, but what you're suggesting is not one of them!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it because of William? Is he the one you love?" Lawrence asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes. The person I love is him. He is my boyfriend and the person I want to marry in the future!" Jasper replied without any hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although there had never been any intense separation between her and William, even when they had to be apart because they lived in different cities, they would regularly meet and often video call, so she never felt that William had ever left her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This long-lasting relationship gradually turned from liking to love, and she didn't know how deep her love for William was, but she knew she wanted to live with him in the future, just like her parents.</span></p></div>
