        <h1>Chapter 2545</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Back out? Why would I back out?" Amber Mitchell chuckled and said, "Now that Herman's real killer is behind bars, I think he can finally rest in peace. Tomorrow is the day I'm most looking forward to. I only want it to come sooner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss glanced at Amber Mitchell before finally sighing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His opinion of Amber Mitchell was changing after all that had happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he finally vaguely understood why his eldest brother had fallen in love with the woman. He was even willing to give his life to protect this woman in a life-or-death situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because this woman... was indeed kind and righteous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was kind, and not many people were kind these days. One would be lucky to meet someone like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brother and Amber Mitchell would&rsquo;ve been the envy of everyone if he were still alive.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have nothing more to say since you said you won't back out. Spend the night in the Moss family's house. Brother's room is still the same as it was when he was alive, and I've put all the things you wanted in his room," said Daley Moss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was sincerely grateful. "Thank you, Mr. Moss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just call me Beicheng from now on," said Daley Moss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While the car drove toward the Moss family&rsquo;s house, George Gregory also learned about Louise Mitchell's sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was sentenced to life in prison and deprived of political rights for life. The outcome of the trial was no surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Given Louise Mitchell's past crimes, even a death sentence was not unreasonable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only thing that surprised him was... "Did Amber Mitchell just get into the Moss family's car?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Miss Amber Mitchell got into a car with Daley Moss after the trial, and the car drove toward the Moss family&rsquo;s house," the subordinate replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory frowned slightly. 'What on earth is going on? Why did Amber Mitchell go to the Moss family&rsquo;s house?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Herman Moss's room was still the same as it was when Amber Mitchell visited it. However, she felt nostalgic as she entered the room again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Herman...' The name had been etched in her bones and blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what attracted the most attention was the white wedding dress that belonged to her, which the Moss family had custom-made for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, her request to Daley Moss was that... she wanted to wear a wedding dress and marry Herman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Herman was already dead, she still wanted to be Herman's wife. Even though such marriage could never be legally recognized, she hoped her name could be engraved on Herman's tombstone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That way, she could be buried with Herman after she passed away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not marry Herman when he was alive, but she could fulfill her wish by marrying him after he died.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She understood the Moss family's concerns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she was still in her 30s. In the Moss family's opinion, she still had the rest of her life ahead of her. Did she want to be a widow for the rest of her life by marrying a dead man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she only wanted to stay with Herman.</p></div>
