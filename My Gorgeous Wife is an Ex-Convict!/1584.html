        <h1>Chapter 1582</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had a comely face, and she wore light makeup that highlighted her eyes. She had her long hair in an updo with a few strands falling over her face. Her appearance today complemented her elegant temperament. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">People would not find her unworthy of Jason when she stood beside him. On the contrary, her tranquility matched Jason's beauty. Others would find the scene of them together a pleasant sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Some men looked at Grace with amazement, making Jason frown a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She looked beautiful today. It was not because of the clothes and jewelry she wore but her temperament and demure bearing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">One might not find her stunning at first glance, but one would find her pleasing to the eyes&hellip; It would be comfortable being around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This was probably her magic power. It made him seem more and more inseparable from her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The look in the men's eyes made Jason upset as though they were coveting a treasure he was carefully guarding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll take you to meet some people later. Of course, maybe you knew these people five years ago," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace smiled, knowing that Jason had brought her to today's banquet to officially announce her presence to the upper class. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason took her to meet some people, some of whom Grace had seen before. There were also a few others she had not met before. Grace greeted them amiably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After walking around once, Grace said, "I'm going to sit down and rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Are you tired?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm not tired. It's just that my heels today are a little high, so the soles of my feet hurt a little after walking for a long time," whispered Grace. With that said, she licked her lip with the tip of her tongue as if a little embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was already a mother, but she had a unique charm whenever she made such a feminine gesture. Jason found it attractive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His Adam's apple could not help bobbing. Her little movement had awakened his desire. He would probably have his way with her again if they were elsewhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When they reached the lounge area, Jason was stopped by another man. Grace recognized that person as a tycoon involved in microchips. They often appeared in the newspapers, and Jason had introduced her to them before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They seemed to want to talk to Jason about something, so Jason said to Grace, "I'll go over for a talk. You can rest here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," answered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Jason left, she took a glass of champagne from the waiter and looked around the fancy banquet as she sipped on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As she looked around, she realized that many people in the banquet hall had their eyes on her. Most of them were women, and the look in their eyes ranged from curiosity, envy, to hostility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace smiled faintly. Of course, she knew that since she wanted to stand beside Jay, she would have to endure more of such looks in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could put up with these looks!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Grace suddenly saw a figure and could not help feeling surprised.</p></div>
