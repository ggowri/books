        <h1>Chapter 1597</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had been living dazedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Fortunately, Grace was back now and their lives were getting back on track. The only thing he was worried about now was the last bit of memory he could not recall!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why on earth... did she leave me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He only hoped it was as she said&mdash;it was not because she did not love him that she left!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay!" At the amusement park&rsquo;s entrance, Grace said to Jason, "Hold Jasper tight later. She&rsquo;ll run out of sight whenever she enters amusement parks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was holding her son by the hand. She could not help but sigh at her son's obedience. He did not worry her at all. In contrast, her daughter was already pulling Jason around and asking questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We won't lose her. Even if she runs out of sight, someone will find her and bring her back," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Huh?' Grace blinked. 'Does that mean...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Uh... did the bodyguards follow us out today?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, some of them, but not many. We also have people in the amusement park's control room to check the surveillance immediately in case something happens," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace did not have the guts to ask Jason just how many he meant by &lsquo;not many&rsquo;. His definition of &lsquo;not many&rsquo; might be different from hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at Grace's expression, Jason raised his eyebrows and asked, "What's the matter? You don't like being followed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That&rsquo;s not it..." After all, he had sent bodyguards to follow her when she was pregnant. "I just think it&rsquo;s a little over the top for a trip like this.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Over the top?' Jason's heart sank a little. It was because he could not bear the possibility of losing her and the children again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had already lost them once. He knew how bad the pain and despair were!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I just want to protect you," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I know," Grace said and then smiled. "Let's have fun and ignore the bodyguards. Mick, Jasper, let's go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oh, let's go! Let's go!" Jasper shouted excitedly. Like Grace, she held a small fist in her right hand and raised it high.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed found it a little silly but seeing that his mother and sister had raised their fists, his delicate little face showed his dilemma. Moments later, he raised his hand like them too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper looked at herself, her mother, and her brother. She pouted and said, "Why isn&rsquo;t Daddy raising his hand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Well, your daddy..." Grace was finding an excuse for Jason when she saw that Jason had also raised his fist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was dumbfounded. She only did this gesture because it was her and her daughter&rsquo;s habit. She had not thought much about it when she did it. She never thought he would end up doing the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The action did not quite match his image!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jason was really doing it. Grace looked at Jason in surprise while Mick Reed looked at his father in a daze. Only Jasper was happily shouting, "Let's go! Let's go!"</p></div>
