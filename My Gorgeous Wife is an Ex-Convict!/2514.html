        <h1>Chapter 2512</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why would those doctors suddenly change their statements? Have they been in contact with anyone else?" Amber Mitchell asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There was a food poisoning incident at the detention center, so they were all taken to the hospital for tests," the lawyer said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's heart sank. They might have met someone there and negotiated the terms, which was why they suddenly changed their statements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could George Gregory have done that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory once said he would protect Louise Mitchell, so was this George Gregory's plan?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there no way to convict Louise Mitchell based on the evidence we currently have?" Amber Mitchell asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lawyer said, "It's difficult unless there's new evidence. I'm sorry. Grace asked me to help you before she left Deer City, but I haven&rsquo;t been very helpful."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said, "No, you've helped me so much already. Thank you, Lawyer Gan. I&rsquo;ll try to work things around. Perhaps there's a way to turn things around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she got up and walked out of the law firm. She headed for Moss Enterprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss looked at Amber Mitchell in his office. "You came to see me about my brother's car accident, right? Have you thought of anything else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Several doctors involved have changed their statements in the lawsuit against the Mitchell family. The lawyer just told me that Louise Mitchell will likely be acquitted once she goes to court," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss said unconcernedly, "I&rsquo;ve never cared about her guilt or innocence. If you're looking to me to help you get her convicted, you've come to the wrong guy. I'm the last person in Deer City who&rsquo;ll help you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s not for me but Herman!" Amber Mitchell corrected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss's eyes narrowed. "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The person behind the accident is either Louise Mitchell or connected to Louise Mitchell. "If Louise Mitchell is acquitted and released, it&rsquo;ll be difficult to bring her to justice if she goes abroad." Amber Mitchell took a deep breath and took out a photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The photo showed a woman dressed as a waitress. She looked to be about 27 or 28 years old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is a photo of a woman named Sandra Lucas from the information you gave me before. One month after the accident, I happened to see this woman looking for Louise Mitchell at the entrance of the Mitchell family&rsquo;s house. Come to think of it, her gaze was evasive, and she lowered her head when she saw me. But I didn't think much of it at the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, Amber Mitchell continued saying, "I investigated it the other day. Sandra Lucas resigned three days after the car accident. She told her colleagues that she had made a lot of money buying stocks and was going to enjoy her fortune. However, she had never opened any accounts in the stock market.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"On the third day after the accident, Louise Mitchell's bank account had one million dollars unaccounted for. One month later, another sum of five million dollars was unaccounted for. Sandra Lucas left Deer City and became a missing person. They found her corpse in a town near Deer City half a year later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, you suspect that Sandra Lucas has something to do with this?" Daley Moss asked rhetorically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said, "Don't you think it's suspicious? I&rsquo;ve checked, and Sandra Lucas only had one younger brother, but he moved elsewhere soon after Sandra Lucas's body was found. I hope the Moss family can help me find Sandra Lucas's brother's whereabouts. Her brother may be the only breakthrough. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d want Herman's death to go unexplained and the real killer to go unpunished, Mr. Moss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss stared at Amber Mitchell with her thin lips pressed together tightly. "I hope you're telling the truth. If you're taking advantage of the Moss family for your own revenge, there's no way I'll let you off the hook."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can kill me at any time if I&rsquo;m lying to you. I won't have any objections," Amber Mitchell said bluntly.</p></div>
