        <h1>Chapter 171</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace paused in her footsteps and slowly turned around. She saw that the car was slowly becoming a small black dot as it traveled further.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">'Perhaps, there will never be any other man who will wholeheartedly treat me well and is not even bothered by my criminal records. The only problem is that I don&rsquo;t want to drag him down with me.'</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She looked until she could not see the car before turning around to head toward her house.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, she did not notice the black Bentley parked by the roadside not too far away. The person in the car lazily looked out the window with a vague smile as if he was watching something amusing.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence, who was in the front row, nervously looked through the rearview mirror. After observing his boss for a while, he thought, 'The look on Mr. Reed's face right now... is a telltale sign that he is about to burst out in anger!'</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence inwardly chided Grace, 'If you're going home, just go home. Why did you allow another man to drive you home? What will Mr. Reed think about this!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&lsquo;At first, I thought that it would be a good thing to let Mr. Reed see Grace. Now, I think I should start praying hard that I won&rsquo;t be the punching bag in Grace's stead.'</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed, I suppose... Miss Cummins had some matters that she needed someone to send her back." Terrence broke the silence in the car.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason looked at Terrence with an indescribable look. "Why? Are you interceding for her?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence suddenly felt chills running down his spine and obediently kept his mouth shut.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">'Okay. It looks like the person who needs prayers is Grace.'</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the same time, Grace had arrived back at her rented home. She switched on the lights and placed the food that she bought from the canteen for eight bucks on the table. After that, she made her way into the bathroom to wash her hands.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her pair of hands had always worked in a dirty environment, so they no longer looked smooth and supple like how they used to be.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She only hoped that those words she said today would not be too traumatic for Chase. She then chuckled to herself. If those words did not affect him, then he might continue to waste his time and effort on her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Whichever way the situation went, it would have its consequences.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She sighed and looked at her reflection on the mirror by the wall. She was swamped with tons of problems herself. Her uncle's issues, her grandmother's condition... She did not know what to do anymore.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace froze when she came out of the bathroom. Jason was not only sitting by the small table, but he was also playing with a key in his hand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That key... She had given him that key in the past. When they were at the hospital, she had not asked him to return the key and neither did she change the lock to this house. This made it a breeze for him to walk in as he pleased.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why... are you here?" she asked awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If I didn&rsquo;t come, how would I find out that someone had sent you home?" Jason said as he stood up and naturally walked over to Grace. "The guy who sent you home today is that fella who works as a driver at the Sanitation Service Center?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was taken aback. 'He saw Chase sending me home?'</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">For a moment, she pursed her lips, refusing to say a word.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He walked up to her and grabbed her chin. "Why? Is he the reason why you refused to stay by my side? What is he to you?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's none of your business!" Grace wanted to look away, but the strength of his grip was extraordinarily strong that she could not even move an inch.</p></div>
