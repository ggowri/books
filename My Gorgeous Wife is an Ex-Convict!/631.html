        <h1>Chapter 630</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz felt a burning pain on her face, half of which seemed numb. When she covered her face and looked at the man who had struck her, it was Grace's boyfriend whom she met before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you&hellip; Did you just slap me?" stammered Andrea Schwartz.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What, can't I slap you?" asked Jason as he laughed in anger. There was an air of rare rage in his deep eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm&hellip; I'm helping you. You&hellip; You don't know that Grace is having an affair with Brian. They..." Andrea Schwartz said as she swallowed the pain, but before she could finish, she was slapped hard in the face once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instantly, both of Andrea Schwartz's cheeks were red and swollen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz even tasted blood in her mouth, which showed how heavy the two slaps were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what frightened her more was the look of rage in his eyes. He looked&hellip; Murderous! She even felt as if the man in front of her could kill her at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He&rsquo;s only... Grace's boyfriend, not some big shot, so I have nothing to be afraid of! I'm... I'm going to report this to the police and embarrass Grace and her boyfriend!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, there was the sudden sound of footsteps. Andrea Schwartz heard the voice of the firm's boss. "There you are, Mr. Reed. Grace's here too. Long time no see. Come, come. Let's go in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The boss, who was usually cold and stern, now had a face full of enthusiasm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stood coldly on the spot, looking at Grace. "Is she the one who spilled tea on you the previous time? What do you think should happen to her after talking about you like that today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Jason already had someone look into what happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz was shocked. She felt that Grace's boyfriend was too obnoxious. 'What does he mean by what should happen to me? It&rsquo;s as if he can decide my fate easily.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The boss looked at the scene in front of him, then at Andrea Schwartz's swollen cheeks and Jason's cold expression. He immediately shouted, "What's going on here, Andrea Schwartz?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could Andrea Schwartz tell him? After all, what she said about Grace earlier involved Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, after prevaricating for quite some time, Andrea Schwartz still did not say anything helpful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Andrea Schwartz and said coldly, "Andrea Schwartz, what happened to me is not something you can trample on. If you want to trample on others, sooner or later you&rsquo;ll be trampled on too! Now that you've recorded all the things you've said about me today, I'll keep it as evidence. If you ever say anything again, be prepared to go to jail!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's words were so harsh that Andrea Schwartz found her phone to be a hot potato. She&hellip; She saw her recording it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's go in, Jay. I want to see the evidence you've found," said Grace. Only by looking at the evidence could she be reassured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure!" answered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The boss and a few of the top executives of the firm quickly led the way, leading the two into the firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz was still frozen to the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh yes. Remember to copy all the recordings on that woman's phone. They're evidence!" said Jason.</p></div>
