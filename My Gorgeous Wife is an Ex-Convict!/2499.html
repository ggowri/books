        <h1>Chapter 2497</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace's car returned to Reed Residence in Emerald City, Jason was already standing outside waiting for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was already ten p.m. As Grace was pregnant, the driver drove slowly. He was afraid that driving too fast would affect the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace saw Jason at Reed Residence's entrance, her eyes got slightly wet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not only because they had been apart for ten days but because... she now had a little life in her belly. The baby was a continuation of their lineage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace got down from the car, Jason suddenly stepped forward and hugged her. The first words he uttered were... "I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze. "What's the matter? Why are you apologizing so suddenly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry, I was careless. I should&rsquo;ve been more careful not to get you pregnant," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then realized why he was apologizing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's there to apologize for? I'm actually glad I&rsquo;m pregnant again," said Grace. After all, she thought she would only have her triplets in her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she now had another baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Glad?" Jason narrowed his eyes slightly, but there was no joy in those dark peach blossom eyes, only worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Grace reacted, Jason grabbed Grace's hand and said, "Let's go inside first. It's cold outside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After entering the mansion, Jason asked the servants to leave first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are the children asleep?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, they are. They have no idea you were coming back today. Otherwise, they would&rsquo;ve probably waited until you got back,&rdquo; said Jason, his worried eyes resting on her flat belly. "Are you planning to give birth to the baby in your belly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded and said, "Since I've gotten pregnant, I want to give birth to them, of course."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was silent with a rare look of hesitation on his handsome face as if he was trying to decide what to say next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way he behaved filled Grace with anxiety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you not want the baby?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together before finally sighing. "I want our baby. How can I not? But the doctor said that your uterus was damaged when you carried the triplets. You weren't even fit to give birth to the triplets. And you wouldn't be fit for any more pregnancies even if you managed to give birth to the triplets."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because... it was too dangerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid that she would be in danger again, so he chose to undergo a vasectomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not expect her to get pregnant anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not impossible, though. Perhaps if he had been more careful and gone back to the hospital to check his condition post-operation, he would have noticed the situation earlier and prevented her from getting pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His mind almost went blank when she called him and told him that the driver would be driving her home today because she was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no joy but fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lost her for five years back then. She finally came back, and he did not want to lose her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People who had lost something knew how precious it was to have it again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, we already have three kids. They&rsquo;re enough, aren&rsquo;t they?" Jason murmured.</p></div>
