        <h1>Chapter 4284 Pretending Not to Know</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's fine," Harley awkwardly smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell actually didn't want his friends to know about her existence. In all these years, besides a few from the Crypt families, she hadn't met anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He never introduced her to his friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, I'm almost done eating. I'm going to leave," Harley said uncomfortably.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina glanced at the food on the table, thinking, "Hasn't he eaten much? He's almost done?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, before Tina could react, Harley had already hurriedly stood up and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley!" Tina couldn't help but shout.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her shout caught the attention of Lornell, who was originally sitting at another table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell looked up and glanced in Tina's direction. Then, his gaze followed the hurried figure that was leaving, and his eyebrows unconsciously furrowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lornell, what are you looking at?" someone asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing," Lornell replied, retracting his gaze as if he hadn't seen anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, what do you think of Eva?" another classmate teased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The atmosphere suddenly became lively.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina watched the lively scene at Lornell's table and suddenly understood why Harley had left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though they were engaged, Lornell didn't seem to have any intention of getting up after seeing Harley leave. Moreover, the people around Lornell were clearly trying to match him with another girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if those people didn't even know that Lornell had a fianc&eacute;e!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or maybe Lornell simply didn't take this engagement seriously, so he never mentioned it to the people around him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And naturally, those people didn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The engagement of the Crypt families?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina suddenly thought of her own engagement with Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Chandler had originally agreed to the engagement because of the curse of the insects...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then why did Lornell agree to the engagement with Harley? Was it just to save her life?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this answer, only Lornell himself understood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina lost her appetite and glanced at Lornell's table before leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing her afternoon classes, Harley was about to go to a nearby bookstore when she saw a gathering of people at the school gate, apparently discussing something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This car is a limited edition. Not many people in Emerald City can afford it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are the people inside? What kind of department are they from? Hopefully, it's a handsome guy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The discussions of the people around intrigued Harley, and she looked towards the center of the crowd.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, with just one glance, her footsteps suddenly stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was because the limited edition car that everyone was talking about was a car she was very familiar with.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Lornell's car!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is Lornell in the car right now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about the scene in the restaurant earlier, Harley's hand couldn't help but tighten around the strap of her backpack.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Lornell doesn't want anyone to know about their relationship, it's best to pretend they don't know each other!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that in mind, Harley turned away and walked in the opposite direction, no longer looking at the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, she suddenly heard a familiar voice behind her: "Why, no greeting for me?"</span></p></div>
