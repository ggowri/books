        <h1>Chapter 3621</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Over time, rumors and gossip about William in the school grew stronger and stronger. Behind all this, Jasper couldn't shake off the feeling that an invisible hand was orchestrating everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some aspiring internet celebrities took advantage of the situation and sneaked into the school to secretly film William, hoping to gain popularity. Even though the school reported to the police and caught several of these individuals, they couldn't completely prevent such behavior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper then suggested to William, "Why don't you take a temporary leave for a few days to avoid this wave of attention?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need," he said, "If I really avoid it, then some people will feel even more right about what they said!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you and my older brother find the person who posted on the forum last time?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, we found them. We have identified someone now, but that person is overseas, and they are likely just a hired hand. The real mastermind is someone else," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know why, but I always feel like that incident and what happened to your grandparents this time are somehow connected," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the time interval between the two incidents was too short, and it seemed like they both wanted to destroy William with public opinion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether there is a connection or not, I will uncover the mastermind," William said confidently.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later that evening, Jasper was looking at sheet music in the dormitory when Meave rushed in, saying, "Jasper, I just came back and saw a bunch of people blocking William at the school gate."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Jasper was taken aback and asked urgently, "What's going on?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Meave took a breath and said, "It seems that something happened to William's grandparents. They were admitted to the hospital, and then a group of small internet celebrities holding their phones and third-rate journalists blocked William, not allowing his car to enter the </span><span>school. And when he got out of the car to enter the school, those people surrounded him, bombarding him with all sorts of random questions."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Jasper quickly changed his shoes and was about to rush out of the dormitory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, are you... are you planning to go to the school gate?" Meave quickly interjected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I am!" Jasper replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's so chaotic outside, if you go, it will only get worse, especially with all those unscrupulous people doing live broadcasts. If you get captured on the internet, a lot of people might start criticizing you too," Meave said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there are all kinds of people online now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if that happens, it doesn't matter!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, do you really like William that much? Even at a time like this, you still want to go find him? If William treats you badly in the future, I might not help you beat him up!" Meave said anxiously.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Jasper ran towards the school gate, she couldn't help but think about what Meave had said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What exactly is her liking towards William?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In times like these, she knew that maybe her going there wouldn't make a difference and might even make things worse, but she just couldn't let William be alone!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, how deep is her liking for him?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was almost running to the school gate, when suddenly, a figure appeared in a dark corner and grabbed her. A familiar voice sounded in her ear, "Where are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper paused and saw Roger's clear and handsome face!</span></p></div>
