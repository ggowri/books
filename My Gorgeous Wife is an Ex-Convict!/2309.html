        <h1>Chapter 2307</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace, I'll never let you go again...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss lasted an unknown amount of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, love me like this forever&hellip;" His hoarse voice was full of longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Love me... till the end of time... Forever and always...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla waited anxiously for the results of Grace's investigation. However, they could not find anything on Amber Mitchell after several days even though they had looked into Jacqueline Bowman's acquaintances and the places she frequently visited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was careful not to leave behind any clues because she knew it was only hope of getting out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I'll continue looking into it. If I still can&rsquo;t find anything, I'll think of another way. Don't panic," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, thank you," answered Kyla. Once they ended the call, she smiled bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could she not be anxious?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace was already doing so much for her. She could only wait. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well? Did they find anything?" asked Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook her head. "It's hard to find anything at the moment. And this investigation requires time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated for a moment before seemingly making up her mind. She said, "Mom, I want to go to L City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"L City?" Mrs. Corbyn froze. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's... tMason Swansonty where the Weiss family is!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... You're not going to see Martin Weiss, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Kyla smiled bitterly. "In this situation, I can only go look for Martin Weiss, get him to issue a memorandum of understanding, and hope he&rsquo;ll spare Jacqueline Bowman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But isn't that going too easy on Jacqueline Bowman?" Mrs. Corbyn's teeth itched with hatred at the thought of what the woman had done to her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If Amber Mitchell is indeed suffering, the sooner I know where Amber Mitchell is, the sooner I might be able to get her out of her misery. Jacqueline Bowman is the least of my concern right now," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just wanted to save Amber Mitchell. Nothing else mattered!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But maybe Jacqueline Bowman is just making things up. She never once mentioned she knew where Amber Mitchell was before this,&rdquo; said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "It's not impossible, but... I'm scared to bet on that possibility, Mom. Anyway, the only thing I can do now is talk to Martin Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But... didn't you just separate from him? Will he... say yes?" Mrs. Corbyn was deeply worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was silent. She knew better than anyone how harsh and ruthless she was to Martin Weiss the day they separated. She thought she would not have anything to do with Martin Weiss anymore, but reality gave her a good slap in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know, but I should try, shouldn't I?" She smiled bitterly and said, "But if I'm going to L City, you'll have to take care of the store and Nelson yourself.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll be fine, but I&rsquo;m worried about you going to L City while pregnant"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll be alright. I'm not even five months pregnant yet, so I don't have trouble moving around. And I'll be taking the high-speed train. There's staff on the high-speed train. They'll take care of me if anything happens," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn sighed and said nothing more. She knew her daughter would insist on taking a trip to L City. </p></div>
