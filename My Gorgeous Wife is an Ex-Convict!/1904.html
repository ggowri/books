        <h1>Chapter 1902</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Half an hour later, the security guard at the old mansion reported, "Young master Reed, Young Madam is leaving the mansion."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason's eyes gleamed. 'Is she planning to leave here, after all?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ask the driver to take her back to Reed Residence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," he answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, to Jason's surprise, the driver who drove Grace reported, "Young Madam didn't return to Reed Residence but found a hotel to stay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The driver then reported the name and address of the hotel as well as the room number Grace checked into.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason frowned slightly. 'Hotel? But it doesn't matter whether she goes back to Reed Residence or stays in a hotel. Let her have it her way.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Jason lay down on the big bed at night, he suddenly found the bed a little empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before she came here, he would lay alone in this bed at night. It did not seem to feel this way back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Was it because she had been so clingy these days that he felt a little out of sorts after she left him so suddenly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The aggrieved and indignant words she uttered as she tugged at his collar in the study earlier recurred to him again and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For a moment, he was confused about what was true and what was false.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The memory in his mind was telling him the truth of her falling into the sea, but what about what she and Terrence said? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If what they said was true, what about his memories?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason only found his head to be in a muddle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the other side, Grace lay in a hotel room, her head also in a muddle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had left the old mansion impulsively, but she could not go back to Reed Residence. After all, she just told her children that she had work to do in the video call and would not be home in a few days. If she went home so soon, it would be a slap in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, if the children asked why their father did not come home with her, she would not know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Thinking of how clingy she had been in the past few days and how impulsive she was in the study today, her efforts for so many days all went down the drain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It felt so agonizing when you loved someone but they did not believe you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace gave a bitter smile. 'Did I cause all of this? If I hadn't hurt him and betrayed him for Mrs. Watts, then maybe he would trust me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Maybe Jay could trust me again if we find out what happened to his memory as soon as possible.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace planned to go back to the old mansion the next day. However, before she got back to the old mansion, her phone rang. It was Lina's mother calling, and she sounded somewhat anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, did Lina... contact you?" asked Mrs. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, what's the matter?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well, I accompanied Lina to go to the Municipal Women's Hospital for a pregnancy check-up today. When we were about to head home, I went to the toilet and didn't see Lina when I returned. But Lina called me and told me that she met a friend and wanted to have a meal with them, so she asked me to go home first. But it's been five hours and she hasn't come home. I can't get through to her phone either," said Mrs. Sweeney.</p></div>
