        <h1>Chapter 2750</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was considered the most intimate woman with him in the past few years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian fell into a trance as he watched Valda Theller. Valda Theller looked up and met Brian's eyes as soon as she finished her work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but suddenly blush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her two assistants snickered. "Valda, you and your boyfriend are so sweet. He&rsquo;s been looking at you since you were drawing earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, he must really like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller chuckled sheepishly. "Alright, let's call it a day. You only need to color them tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes. We'll stop being the third wheels." The two assistants laughed and got up. They packed up their things and bade goodbye to Brian before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller went to Brian and said, "You must have waited for a long time. Don't mind my two assistants' nonsense."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his eyebrows. "What's there to mind? I'm your boyfriend. We should be sweet with each other. I should like you very much too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller pressed her lips together... 'Should.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, this must be like a blank exam paper for him, and he's working on it for someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But this is the path I've chosen. I have nothing to complain about. Perhaps I should even feel lucky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'At least the person I like is trying to fall for me when he doesn't like me and is in love with someone else.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must be hungry. Let's have dinner together," Brian said after looking at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Valda Theller. She packed up her things and left the studio with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting in the car, Brian asked, "What would you like to eat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anything will do. Or we can go somewhere you usually go?" she said. Since they were now in a real relationship, she wanted to know more about him. She wanted to learn about his likes and dislikes, the restaurants he frequented, and what he liked to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Brian started the car and drove slowly toward the west of tMason Swansonty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, the car stopped in front of a restaurant surrounded by plants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This area was in Emerald City's scenic area. Due to its remote location, there was not much of a crowd, making it quiet and elegant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two got out of the car. Valda Theller followed Brian to the door and saw someone coming over. They said, "Mr. Hart, welcome. Do you want your usual table?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person led the way, and Valda Theller walked in, only to see the restaurant's unique points. There were some ancient-looking buildings, pavilions, bridges, and streams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they reached the corridor, someone came over. After seeing Brian, the person said enthusiastically, "Young Master Hart, fancy running into you today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It is," replied Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is..." Their eyes glanced at Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is my girlfriend, Valda Theller." Brian introduced her to them generously. Surprise flashed across the person's eyes, but their gaze returned to normal afterward. They smiled at Valda Theller and said hello.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, they added, "Since we ran into each other, why don't we dine together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Valda Theller, obviously asking for Valda Theller's opinion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hesitated. Seeing Brian's reaction, he should be familiar with the person. It would be inappropriate to reject them, so she nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned to the person and said, "Let's dine together, then."</p></div>
