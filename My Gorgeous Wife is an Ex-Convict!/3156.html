        <h1>Chapter 3154</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In addition, the funds that the Barlow family transferred abroad this time were raised from private individuals. Such behavior constitutes fraud, and therefore the Barlow family will definitely face severe legal sanctions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In short, everyone understands that the Barlow family is finished!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at the news with little emotion, only feeling a sense of resignation towards the unpredictability of life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Tracy had known that one incident would lead to such consequences, I wonder if she would have made the same choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy wanted to control public opinion to turn the tables, but ended up being destroyed by her own actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the following days, Valda didn't return to her own small apartment but continued to stay at Brian's villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, if she moves back to the small apartment, Brian will probably have to sleep on the couch again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, living in Brian's villa, even though they have separate rooms, every night Brian still goes into her bedroom and cuddles with her while they sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I feel like I can only be at peace when I'm holding you like this while sleeping," he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At peace?" She blinked slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I'm afraid that if I'm not careful, you'll disappear again," he said, holding her tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She seemed to understand his fear and hugged him back, saying, "Brian, I won't disappear."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, you won't...disappear again..." he murmured. "Okay, go to sleep. You said you're going to pick out soft furnishings for the new house tomorrow. You'll have a lot to do starting tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I'll go to sleep," she replied, closing her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her and couldn't help but smile. Holding her like this was happiness to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, Valda started running to the home decor store to pick out soft furnishings. Brian even sent a driver to follow her to prevent her from getting too tired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, Brian wanted all the bodyguards and servants to follow Valda, but she refused, saying that she was just going to a home decor store and it would be too much to have so many people with her. She was afraid of being stared at like a "panda" again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, Brian had to instruct the driver to keep a closer eye on Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda picked out some furniture and household items, especially those suitable for the elderly, hoping that her godmother would be comfortable when she came to visit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every day that follows is busy for Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every day, she has to buy new furniture for her newly purchased house, make some renovations in certain areas, and go to the hospital for leg rehabilitation. At the same time, her work as a comic artist has also slowly resumed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, the online buzz about her has gradually died down, allowing her to feel a bit more at ease.</p></div>
