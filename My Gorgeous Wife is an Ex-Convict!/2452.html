        <h1>Chapter 2450</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That might be enough to convince outsiders&hellip; but George won't be so easily convinced," Louise Mitchell said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So what even if he suspects it and figures out the truth? Can he pursue it? Will he give up his family or even half of his career for Amber Mitchell, who has been living a life of pure misery?" Mr. Mitchell was dissatisfied with his daughter's behavior. She acted as though the sky was about to fall. "Don't forget, you have a child with George Gregory."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's eyes lit up instantly. Yes, she still had Ruiheng. Ruiheng was the only grandson of the Gregory family. Even if George still had feelings for Amber Mitchell, he would not hurl mud at the Mitchell family and her for Ruiheng&rsquo;s sake!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, is Ruiheng still abroad?" Mr. Mitchell asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, he's with his grandparents. They said they want him to spend some time abroad before he starts school," said Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As his mother, you should go along. He's your son, but you leave him to others all day long. Be careful, or he won't have any affection for the Mitchell family and you!" Mr. Mitchell scolded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes, I&rsquo;ll spend more time with Ruiheng in the future," Louise Mitchell said quickly before exchanging a look with her mother, who was beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her father had no idea about it, but she and her mother knew that Ruiheng was not her child. He was Amber Mitchell's child. He was Amber Mitchell and George Gregory's child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Louise Mitchell had not been unable to conceive, she would not have found ways to get Amber Mitchell's baby and raise him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Heaven knew how she thought of Amber Mitchell every time she saw the child's face. As the child grew older, he began to resemble Amber Mitchell more and more. She was worried that someone would one day realize that the child looked like Amber Mitchell and then discover Amber Mitchell was his biological mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If that day came, she would rather have her child disfigured to keep it a secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In short, no one must discover that Amber Mitchell was the child's biological mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla accompanied Amber Mitchell to the single-room ward, where Amber Mitchell kept talking to her in a hoarse voice, "Thank you... Kyla. Thank you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You haven't spoken for a long time, and your throat will hurt if you suddenly talk too much. We'll talk for as long as you want when you feel better," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell nodded as her eyes rested on Kyla's bulging belly. At that moment, a touch of regret rose in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If... my child were still alive, they&rsquo;d be seven years old by now. It's a pity that... I failed to protect the little life and lost the child...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stretched out her deformed right hand as if to touch Kyla&rsquo;s belly but hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took Amber Mitchell's hand and placed it on her bulging belly. "I'm six months along, and perhaps you'll see the child soon. Be their godmother when the time comes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tears in Amber Mitchell's eyes welled up even more. "Okay, I'll be the child's godmother..." she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla told Amber Mitchell more about herself. Finally, she asked Amber Mitchell to stay in the hospital. The Reed family and the Weiss family had sent people to protect Amber Mitchell in the hospital. Due to the media's intervention and the preliminary evaluation by the psychiatrist Philip Barlow had invited, the Mitchell family dared not take Amber Mitchell away by force anymore.</p></div>
