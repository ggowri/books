        <h1>Chapter 2987</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Patrick didn't say is that even Grace can't.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once, during the time when Jason and Grace broke up, Brian accompanied Grace even though he was anxious and cautious at that time. However, now with Valda, he is relaxed and happy, unlike before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, Patrick feels that Brian might have already fallen in love with Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I promise, I will not easily give up on him," Valda vowed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good," Patrick smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After returning to the villa, Brian asked Valda, "What did Patrick say to you today when he pulled you aside so mysteriously?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He said that I have brought a lot of smiles to your face and that we are good together," Valda said, wrapping her arms around Brian's waist and looking up at him. "Brian, do you like me more now than before?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he replied seriously, "I like you, a lot, a whole lot!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" She exclaimed with joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really," he said, "Valda, I really like you, a lot!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This kind of liking felt different from his previous love for Grace, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what was different. Maybe he would understand it better in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda beamed, "Brian, I love you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That night, she willingly gave herself to him. Liking someone, falling in love with someone, it all felt so natural!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wished he had fallen in love with her sooner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she would be incredibly happy when that day finally came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While walking on the street, Valda ran into Zelda. However, this time, Zelda's gaze towards her was completely different from when they last met at the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda furrowed her brows and planned to walk past her. Although they were old classmates, their last encounter at the restaurant was far from pleasant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zelda quickly ran forward and blocked Valda's path.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, why don't we have a chat?" Zelda said in a low and humble voice. "After all, we've been old classmates. You wouldn't deny me a chance to chat, would you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't think there's much for us to talk about, and I don't want people to judge me based on my clothes or give me old clothes to wear," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zelda feels like slapping her past self. Who would have thought that Valda is actually the girlfriend of Brian, the prince of the entertainment industry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These past few days, she came across a viral news story and watched Brian's live interview on TV, finally discovering his true identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because she found out, she was extremely upset and her fianc&eacute; Ginger, who had been treating her well, started calling her a fool to her face after finding out about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What they're saying is, if she hadn't tried to belittle Valda back then and instead took the opportunity to build a good relationship with Valda, they could have climbed up to Brian's position now!"</p></div>
