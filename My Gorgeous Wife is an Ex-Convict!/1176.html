        <h1>Chapter 1175</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have a friend who's hospitalized here, and I have to visit him. I must go now," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, okay," answered Chase Harper. Then, he leaned a little awkwardly to let Grace through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace walked toward the elevator in the corridor, Chase Harper was still staring blankly at her thin figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know which man Grace had ended up choosing, Jason or Brian. He dared not ask, and there was no need for him to ask either. After all, she would be happy no matter who she chose between the two men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was nothing compared to those two men!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... his heart still could not let her go. Even after knowing that she and he did not have any possibility to get together, he still could not let those feelings go easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace came to Brian's ward, only this time she saw not only Stella but also Brian's parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing here?" Madam Hart immediately pulled a long face and looked at Grace disapprovingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm here to visit... Mr. Hart," Grace said flatly. She was carrying a bag of fruits in her hand. "I bought some fruits, but I don't know if Mr. Hart likes them. I'll leave after putting them down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could naturally see that Brian's parents did not welcome her. After all, who would like a woman who had nearly killed their precious son?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Madam Hart said angrily, "No thanks, we don't need your fruits. If it hadn't been for you, Brian wouldn't be suffering from these injuries!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Mom! I got hurt because of the choice I made. No one forced me to do it. If you really care about me, don't treat Grace this way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Madam Hart turned to glare at her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"To me, there are two women in my life who are most important to me. One is you, and the other is Grace!" Brian said bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you talking about? Did you forget she and Jason&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's all in the past!" Brian interrupted his mother and said, "Mom, I beg you. Please stop talking about it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid that every word she said would only cut Grace's heart and separate him even more from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had finally managed to approach her after taking things step by step! He did not want to lose the possibility he had tried so hard to gain because of something like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Madam Hart looked at her son's pleading face and gasped. "Are you...?" However, the words were stuck in her throat, and she could not go on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her son's eyes and expression told her how much he cared about that woman Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Madam Hart was shocked. When had Brian ever begged for a woman like this? He even said he would make an enemy of the Reed family for Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let's go home first." Mr. Hart pulled Madam Hart, giving each other an out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before they left, Mr. Hart looked intently at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella, who had been regarded as an invisible person this whole time, spoke reluctantly, "Brian, Aunt was just worried about you. Why would you break her heart like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced faintly at Stella. However, the glance sent shivers down Stella's spine.</p></div>
