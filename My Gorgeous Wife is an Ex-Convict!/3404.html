        <h1>Chapter 3402</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That handsome face can be said to have inherited the best qualities of Lily and Philip - refined and elegant, yet also possessing a rare sense of introverted depth that is uncommon for someone his age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William is already known as the most desirable guy among girls in school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, William doesn't mince his words when it comes to the girls who desperately try to pursue him. He even throws away all the gifts they give him into the trash can.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people in school know that he has a childhood sweetheart, and whenever she calls, he answers immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If there is something that he treasures or cherishes in particular, it's almost always something that the girl gave him or something related to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, although many people in the school are aware of the existence of this girl, there are not many who actually know that she is Jasper's girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The eldest princess of the Reed family is the person who William has been hiding in his heart for so many years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps no one would have thought that William would become the eldest son of the Barlow family and return to his ancestral roots, all because of Jasper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are you suddenly asking this?" Jasper said strangely at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because...we are slowly growing up," William said, "so there are some things that I will think about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you thinking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm thinking about whether we can still be together like this in the future," he said, staring at her intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She blinked in confusion, "Of course we'll be together, didn't you say you'll come live in Emerald City when we grow up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew she didn't really understand what she was saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, I'll come back to Emerald City in the future, and then we can always be together, right?" He smiled slightly and said to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay!" She replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Alright, let's go," he said, taking her hand and walking downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Downstairs, guests were gathered, and today's triplets' birthday party was undoubtedly a grand event in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The scene of Jasper and William walking down also attracted the attention of many people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This scene, with the son of a prestigious family and the daughter of a wealthy family, looks like a perfect match!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the two of them reached downstairs, Mick approached Jasper and said, "Come on, let's go. We'll cut the cake together later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Jasper said, naturally pulling his hand out of William's and taking Mick's hand. "William, I'm going over there first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William felt a sense of loss in his palm, as if something was slipping away. He nodded in agreement and watched as Jasper and Mick walked away side by side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the triplets stood together in front of the cake, the guests couldn't help but admire them once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although they are triplets, the three of them do not look alike. Mick looks very similar to Jason, while Jasper's appearance leans more towards Grace. As for the middle one, Mason, his looks can be described as beautiful. For a boy to be described as beautiful, it shows how refined his facial features are.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she is beautiful, she doesn't give off a feminine vibe. Instead, she exudes a reserved and cold demeanor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the triplets, Mick is calm and composed, Jasper is lively and cute, but Mason, at only 14 years old, gives off an elusive feeling.</p></div>
