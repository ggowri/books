        <h1>Chapter 1925</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At this moment, their son was snuggled up in Grace's arms. He blew on her neck, asking, "Will it stop hurting if I do this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her son's actions melted Grace's heart, and she nodded, "Uh-huh, it doesn't hurt anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I&rsquo;ll protect you from now on. I&rsquo;ll beat up the bad guys so that you won't get hurt again," said Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace smiled and kissed her son on the cheek. The little one instantly blushed slightly, but he did not leave Grace's arms. His two small arms wrapped themselves around Grace's waist, and then he laid his face in her arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was his mother's smell. He was going to protect her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason would have taken his son straight out of Grace's arms if he were not injured and still had an IV drip attached to one hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two wanted to spend the night at the hospital with their parents. Jasper even said she would take good care of her parents and not go to kindergarten until they were discharged from the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It took Grace a lot of explaining to dissuade the two young ones from spending the night in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">By the time Uncle Kwan went home with the two siblings, Grace felt like she had fought a tough battle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the evening, two more children came to the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Only this time, it was Mason and Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was surprised to see the two children who were caught and brought over by bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she heard that Veronica Barlow had snuck in and there were a bunch of reporters waiting at the hospital&rsquo;s entrance, Grace was worried about the two children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where are your parents? They didn't come to the hospital with you?" Grace asked Veronica Barlow. After all, the two children were so young. The He family&rsquo;s house was also some distance away from the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"They went out for a party, so I came here with Mason in a taxi!" said Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace broke into a sweat from fright for the two children. She was just glad they did not get into an illegal taxi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Uncle Reed, aunt Cummins, Mason saw the news online and was worried about you. He wanted to see you," said Veronica Barlow as she pushed Mason, who was standing behind her, a few steps forward. "Didn't you say you wanted to see them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mason blinked, and his long black eyelashes started fluttering like fans. His eyes with an empty look in them stared at Jason and Grace. Moments later, he turned to Veronica Barlow and said, "I've seen them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, he shook Veronica Barlow's hand, implying that they could go now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The time he took to &lsquo;see&rsquo; them was so short it would leave one speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Veronica Barlow seemed a little embarrassed. "Won't you see them a little longer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one blinked again and turned his head to look at Jason and Grace as if he was obediently doing what Veronica Barlow just mentioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It might be upsetting for ordinary children to be indifferent to their biological parents, but Grace was happy.</p></div>
