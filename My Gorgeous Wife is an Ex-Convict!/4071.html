        <h1>Chapter 4069</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Okay, every time he's like this, she always feels weak!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're not really angry, are you?" She asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So you dressed up like this today just to test me?" He asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hehe." She chuckled nervously, "Anyway, I know you're probably not sexually frigid."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Take out the word 'probably'!" Chandler said irritably, "And also, I'll have feelings for you regardless of your gender, just because it's you! "</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just because of me?" Tina blinked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, whether you're a man or a woman, I'll fall in love with you. So for me, it doesn't matter what gender you are!" Chandler raised his hand and gently stroked Tina's cheek, "Do you understand what I'm saying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh." She nodded, then suddenly exclaimed, "Do you love me? Do you really love me? No matter what I'm like, you love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes." He said with absolute certainty, "So don't do these kinds of tests again in the future. You're still young, after we get married, you can do whatever you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Getting married...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was taken aback. According to the agreement between the Stephenson family and Hunter, she was supposed to marry Chandler after she graduated from college!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Also, I need to go back to my family for a while to take care of some things. It might take a bit longer," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How long is a bit longer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Probably around a month," Chandler replied. A month should be enough time to take care of everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A whole month?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, be good and I'll contact you when I get back!" Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Tina agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hunter was from the Crypt family, his own family, and Tina had never been there before. Whenever Hunter went back to his family, all communication would be cut off. She couldn't even reach him by phone until he left his family's home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To her, his family was a mysterious place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, can I let go of your hand now?" Chandler asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina finally noticed that she had been holding onto Chandler's wrist the whole time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought for a moment and said to Chandler before letting go of his hand, "Chandler, I love you no matter what you look like!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, she loved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So when she heard him say that he loved her no matter what she looked like, she felt a warm and relieved feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she said those words, it felt so natural to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She loved him... She didn't know when it started, but it felt like it was meant to be!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They had an engagement, so if they loved each other, it would be the luckiest thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she graduated, they would get married and be happy, just like her parents!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No matter what I look like?" Chandler murmured, his expression not as happy as Tina expected, but rather complex and incomprehensible to her. "Tina, some things shouldn't be said too early, or else it will only raise expectations."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And if those expectations were shattered, it would only lead to deep pain!</p></div>
