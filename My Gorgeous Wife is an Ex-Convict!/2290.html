        <h1>Chapter 2288</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss said, "But if he loves you too much, he&rsquo;ll never care about himself! Just like how he risked his health to get his blood drawn and store it in Municipal Women's Hospital for you. How damaging is that to the body? He happened to use that blood in this incident. I'm afraid that as soon as he&rsquo;s well and discharged from hospital, he&rsquo;ll disregard all advice and keep his blood for you again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Mrs. Weiss learned that he was saved by his own blood when he lost a lot of blood this time, she inquired why he had been storing blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finding out the reason, she wanted Kyla to separate from her son even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed to her that her son's love for Kyla had gone too far!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stiffened. "I... I didn&rsquo;t want him to store blood for me either. I'll tell him not to do it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss said, "But as long as he loves you, he&rsquo;ll still risk his own safety and harm his health for such a small possibility even if you tell him not to. Miss Corbyn, why don't you let Martin go? Make him give up completely so that he can stop thinking about you. You can do it if you're willing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss was in tears, even wanting to kneel at Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hurriedly stopped her. "Don't, Aunt. Don't do it. I can't let you kneel. I know you're doing this for Martin. I'll think about what you've said!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss calmed down a little after hearing that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, you're a mother too. I think you should know how I feel," said Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she stepped out of the room, Kyla said to Mrs. Weiss, "I'll go back to the ward, bid goodbye to Martin Weiss, and go home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss nodded. When Kyla turned around, she said, "Kyla, you're a good kid, but many things that shouldn't happen have happened between you and Martin. Perhaps you two are not meant to be."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Not meant to be...' Kyla sighed to herself. After getting back to the ward, there was a touch of anxiety on Martin Weiss's face. As soon as he saw that she had come back, he rushed forward and said, "I was about to go out looking for you. Why did you take so long in the washroom?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You worry if I take a long time in the washroom too?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I was just afraid I said something wrong and upset you," said Martin Weiss as he raised his hand to her reddish eyes. "What happened? Why are your eyes red? Have you been crying? Tell me if I said something that upset you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, my eyes are red because I saw an open window when I passed the corridor and went over to look outside to get some air, but I got sand in my eyes instead. I have to go back to the store. I'll see you again tomorrow," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said as she gathered her things and prepared to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly grabbed her hand. "Are you sure you'll come tomorrow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course." Kyla smiled. "I&rsquo;ll visit you every day while you&rsquo;re in the hospital."</p></div>
