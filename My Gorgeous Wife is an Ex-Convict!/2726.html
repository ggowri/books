        <h1>Chapter 2724</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can choose another gown if you don't like it," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I'll take this one," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took the gown and went into the changing room. Brian walked to the couch nearby and sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a purple gown. Anyone could wear purple, but he could not help asking Valda Theller to change out of the purple gown as soon as he saw her in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked beautiful in the gown, and it suited her, but he did not want to see her in it. It stung his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller put on the pink gown and walked out of the changing room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked up at the person in front of him and said, "Alright, let's go with this one, but the neck seems empty." With that said, he turned to the manager and said, "Bring over some accessories to match her gown."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager quickly replied in acknowledgment and asked someone to bring jewelry over to match Valda Theller's gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller watched the manager handle the jewelry pieces while wearing gloves and instantly realized they were genuine. Besides, they must be worth a lot if the staff member looked so careful handling them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the manager brought out a pearl necklace and earrings, Brian said, "Try this pearl set."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he took the pearl necklace from the manager's hand and leaned down slightly to put it on her himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The pearls were cold against her neck, and his gentle breath made her feel as though her blood was rushing to her head as it blew on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His action was like something out of one of her comics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think?" His voice rang above her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" She shuddered and looked up at the mirror in front of her, and her eyes met those dark phoenix eyes in the mirror. "Very... nice..." Even her voice was stammering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll take it, then," Brian said as his slender fingers picked up the pearl earrings and put them on for Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared at the mirror, watching his every movement as he put on the earrings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart was beating so fast that it was as if something was about to burst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After putting on the pearl necklace and earrings, Valda Theller looked at the person in the mirror. She looked like the socialites in magazines&mdash;classy, elegant, and a little adorable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she knew it was because of the makeup and jewelry. She was still a regular comic artist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She watched Brian swipe his card without blinking. The number seemed astronomical to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The staff and manager in the studio looked at her with envy as if they had seen another Cinderella story come true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she knew it was all false.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even the gentleness when he had helped her put on the jewelry was false. It was a show he put on for others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When everything was ready, Brian looked at the time and said, "It's almost time. Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," she replied as she followed him outside and got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They sat in the back seat. Looking at his handsome profile, she could not help but recall what Raymond Bowman had said earlier.</p></div>
