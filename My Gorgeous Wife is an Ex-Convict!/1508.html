        <h1>Chapter 1506</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Everything played out according to Old master Reed's plan. Perhaps, the only thing that surprised Old master Reed was that Grace would sacrifice her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old master Reed had never thought of it as a possibility. However, he still prepared a survival route for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was also because Old master Reed never thought of that possibility that he only prepared a way for Grace to live, but he did not make further arrangements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hence, it had been up to Secretary Wang to arrange for that! Secretary Wang thought to himself, 'I wonder if I&rsquo;ve done the right thing or not with my arrangements?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old master Reed only wished for the head of the Reed family to not have any weakness. As for Grace, she was Young master Reed's weakness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was just that in this bet, Old master Reed had lost to Young master Reed and also Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If Old master Reed were still alive and saw this outcome, would he change his mind?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And the things that I&rsquo;m doing now, would Old master Reed agree?' Secretary Wang lowered his eyes and glanced at Jason who had passed out. He was feeling a little sorry for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young master Reed, if Grace really loves you, then one day in the future, she&rsquo;ll appear in front of you once again." Secretary Wang gently bent down and inched closer to the side of Jason's ear. He then whispered to Jason who was unconscious, &ldquo;If she doesn&rsquo;t show up, then that can only mean one thing&mdash;she doesn't love you enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And only time can tell you the answer.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After five years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At a grand banquet where all the big shots of Emerald City had gathered, it was only natural that Jason, the chairman of Reed group, was the one gaining all the attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was not even 33 years old, yet he had already taken charge of the great Reed family. Despite already having a son and an adopted daughter, there were still many prestigious ladies who wanted to seek his attention and be the madam of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In all the banquets that Jason attended, the prestigious ladies of the Emerald City would try all means to attend them as well. However, none of them managed to get any closer to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was just like an icy mountain that would not get close to anyone. He would not allow anyone to get closer to him as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, at a corner of the banquet hall, Brian was looking at Jason who was not far away from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was wearing a customized gray Western suit. He had his hair neatly combed, and his stunning face had a faint smile on it. It was just like a perfect mask. It was totally different from the man five years ago who had been frantically searching for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jason, do you really not care about Grace anymore?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That year, when he received news of Grace's death, he could not believe it and even ran to Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could not bring himself to believe that Grace would just die like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, in the end, he only saw an urn and Jason, who was like a crazy man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why is Grace dead?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, why is she dead? It&hellip; should&rsquo;ve been me who&rsquo;s dead!" With a teary face, Jason replied with a smile, "I'm the one who should be dead&hellip; I should die&hellip; but why did she still want me to keep living?! Doesn't she have any idea that it's torture for me to live without her?"</p></div>
