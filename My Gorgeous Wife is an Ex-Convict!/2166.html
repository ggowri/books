        <h1>Chapter 2164</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I don't want that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I don't want her to hate me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'As long as she doesn't hate me, I&rsquo;ll do anything!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After school in the afternoon, Grace was occupied with something else, so she asked Uncle Kwan to pick up the three children from school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The three children sat in the minivan. On the way back, William kept peeking at Jasper Reed, but she did not talk to him. Instead, she kept talking to Mick Reed about kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the three children reached the Reed family&rsquo;s house and got down from the car, William suddenly grabbed Jasper Reed's sleeve and asked a little cautiously, "If... If I apologize to Nelson Corbyn, will you stop hating me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you willing to admit that you deliberately pushed Nelson downstairs and lied?" asked Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William's tiny body stiffened as his face flushed, but the word &lsquo;yes&rsquo; just could not get out of his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I didn't do it, nor did I lie. Why should I admit it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at William's refusal to admit it, Jasper angrily shook him away and walked toward the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William followed slowly, his head hanging low.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I... messed up again. Would she have stopped being angry with me if I had just said yes? Would she not have hated me anymore if I admitted to everything and apologized?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Would we have returned to the way we used to be?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, William was suddenly hit by a pebble. He instantly stopped in pain and covered the spot where he was hit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Your mother was a bad person, and you're a bad person too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, why don't you just leave? Are you going to push us down the stairs too? Oh, we're so scared!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What are you looking at? I'm gonna beat you up, so what?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Several of the servants&rsquo; children who were older than William were nearby. One of them picked up a pebble from the ground and threw it at William again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William was in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He glared intently at them. "I didn't push him down the stairs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He still won't admit it! How shameless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What a good liar!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, Young Lady said he pushed Young Master Corbyn down the stairs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, another child picked up a pebble and threw it at William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William scrambled to avoid the pebbles but still got hit, which hurt him very much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I didn't push him! I didn't!" William denied it desperately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, his denial was futile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He rushed over and tried to beat up the children who had thrown pebbles at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, they were all older than him. He was no match for them. Eventually, they knocked him to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How dare you lie? Why won't you confess that you did it? Your mother did bad things, and so you&rsquo;re doing bad things now too! Admit you pushed him down the stairs!" Those children said as they beat up William.</p></div>
