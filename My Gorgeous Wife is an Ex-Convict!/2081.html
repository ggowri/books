        <h1>Chapter 2079</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she had not been nosy, then that would not have happened last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But I'm glad you did," muttered Martin Weiss. He gently bent over, and his face magnified before Kyla's eyes. "If you hadn't sent me here, we wouldn't have been so intimate last night... We were as intimate as we were back then..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She raised her hand and slapped him hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's cheek was slapped sideways, and a red mark quickly appeared on his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it was as if he did not feel the pain. Instead, he said to her, "If you think hitting me once isn't enough, you can continue hitting me. But Kyla, you can't deny that you had feelings for me last night no matter what. You also wanted me in the end. Though I was drunk, I remember what you said. You said... you wanted me to give it to you. You said..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Shut up! Shut up!" Kyla immediately covered her ears, unwilling to hear it. Everything he said now would only draw her back to that moment and make her feel more miserable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not want it, but her mind could not control her body. He was still familiar with her body even after so many years. It was ridiculous and pathetic!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He pulled down her hands and continued to mutter the explicit and affectionate words she had said the night before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, since you have feelings for me, don't reject me, okay? I'll be good to you... I&rsquo;ll be very good to you. This time, I won't hurt you again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla suddenly laughed, but tears were welling up in those dark eyes. "Did you say you won't hurt me again? But all you did last night was hurt me! That's not what I wanted. That's rape!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She complained loudly, "Martin Weiss, have you ever tried being suppressed by others? And even though you struggled and resisted, you still fail in the end. Have you ever felt that humiliated?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss stared at the person in front of him as if his body was frozen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you think what happened last night was because I still had feelings for you? But it's only humiliation to me. It's only because I couldn&rsquo;t resist. I would have reacted the same way with any other man even if it wasn't you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her accusations and tears were like the sharpest swords, crushing the longing in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Humiliation... Was last night really nothing but a humiliation to you?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She asked sarcastically, "Is it not? Do you think I wanted that to happen with you? Martin Weiss, you've hurt me again and again. How many times do you have to hurt me before you think it's enough?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His face paled, and even the color of his lips seemed to be fading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His lips quivered as he stared at her. "Tell me, don't you feel... even a hint of joy over what happened last night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She answered without hesitation, "No. Last night was just a nightmare!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nightmare?" He smiled bitterly. What seemed like a beautiful dream to him was a nightmare to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He gently raised his fingers to touch her face. With so little distance, he could have easily touched her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she turned away. Her rejection was evident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His hands seemed to freeze in mid-air, and he had no more strength to go forward.</p></div>
