        <h1>Chapter 4026</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand her feelings because I was in the same situation when I was pregnant with you, Mason, and Jasper. Sometimes, for a mother, the child is more important than her own life!" Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I can't do it!" Mick said. "I almost lost her. Knowing that this child is harming her health, I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have already explained to her that I can help her to do everything possible to keep the baby, but if it comes down to a situation where only one of them can survive, then I will choose to save her!" Grace said. "But at least for now, I hope to fulfill her dream of becoming a mother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fulfill her dream?" Mick laughed bitterly, his eyes full of pain. "Just to fulfill her dream, she has to take such a big risk?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If we don't follow what your mother said, then this matter will only become a dead end," Jason said. "Or, are you planning to force her onto the operating table for an abortion? If you do that, she will hate you, and can you bear her hatred?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick trembled, his face turning pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hatred...just the thought of it made him shudder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, Mick came to Nancy's hospital room and looked at her sleeping form.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was she really willing to risk her life to give birth to this child?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could he have thought of using sex as punishment back then?! If he hadn't slept with her, he wouldn't be facing this situation now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick regretted his decision from back then once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From childhood to adulthood, he rarely had anything to regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when facing Nancy, he always seemed to regret something!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is this child really that important to you?" He raised his hand and gently placed it on her swollen belly, separated by the blanket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though it was covered by the blanket, her belly was still very obvious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or perhaps it was because of her injury, she was much thinner than before. He could feel the bones through her skin, as if there was no flesh at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I forcefully take this child away, will you really hate me?" He murmured softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To his surprise, he heard her voice in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will hate you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said it with certainty, without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick looked up and saw that Nancy had already woken up. She was staring at him with her black eyes wide open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When did you wake up?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I didn't fall asleep. I was waiting for you," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had accidentally learned from a nurse that every night after she fell asleep, he would come into her room and leave before she woke up in the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was the one who stayed with her every night in her hospital room!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Will you really force me to have an abortion?" Nancy asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick remained silent and didn't say a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy struggled to sit up, "I know that if you really decide to go against my wishes and have this child aborted, I can't stop you. But I also know that if you do that, I will hate you for the rest of my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's body trembled, "Don't hate me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then respect my decision. I want to take a chance on this child. If it becomes impossible to save the child, I will choose to give up. But not now... I don't want to!" Nancy said.</p></div>
