        <h1>Chapter 4355 Sending Him Home</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you..." Calvert said softly, his handsome face blushing slightly again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley </span><span>blinked,</span><span> it seemed like Calvert was more shy than she had imagined!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing their meal, Harley offered to take Calvert home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert quickly said, "No need, I can take the bus back by myself."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I'm the one who brought you here, it's only right that I take you back. If you take the bus, it might take a lot of time!" Harley insisted, "Or are you determined to refuse my offer to drive you home?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's lips twitched slightly, but in the end, he didn't voice his refusal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps Calvert was a bit reluctant to let go, reluctant to see this beautiful dream end so quickly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, he had dinner with Harley today, chatted together, and said so much. All of this felt like a dream to him. Perhaps after today, he wouldn't have any more interactions with Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, they were like people from two different worlds!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing that Calvert didn't refuse anymore, Harley had the waiter bring her car over.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was driving and asked Calvert, who was sitting in the passenger seat, "What's your address?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert gave an </span><span>address,</span><span> it was in the same area where Harley last saw him getting beaten up. However, Calvert didn't give a specific address, he just asked her to drop him off at the intersection when they got there.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wouldn't it be more convenient if I drove you straight home?" she suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His hand, hanging in front of him, instinctively clenched the corner of his clothes, "No need, my place is all narrow alleys. It's hard for your car to get in and out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley thought about it and realized that it indeed seemed to be the case!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially her driving skills are just average. If she drove in, she might not be able to get out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then!" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert let out a small sigh of relief. There was another reason, he didn't want Harley to see how rundown his living conditions were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though Harley had seen him at his lowest, and not just once.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when Harley dropped him off nearby, he could guess that his living conditions were probably not the best. But he still didn't want Harley to see it with his own eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like this was the only way he could maintain his ridiculous sense of self-esteem.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley dropped Calvert off at the place he mentioned. As Calvert got out of the car, he leaned towards Harley in the driver's seat and said, "Miss Hart, I really can't thank you enough for today!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're all classmates from the same school, so there's no need to call me Miss Hart. Just call me by my name," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"......Alright," Calvert responded softly, but in the end, he didn't call out her name and just shut the car door!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was afraid that calling her name directly would only fuel his desires even more!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was about to drive off, her hands turning the steering wheel. But just as she was about to step on the gas to speed up, she saw in the rearview mirror that Calvert was struggling with a middle-aged man. The man even raised his hand, aiming a punch at Calvert's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was taken aback, suddenly recalling a previous scene where he had seen Calvert getting beaten up around here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be the same guy who fought Calvert last time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With that thought, Harley quickly hit the brakes, stopped the car, and ran towards Calvert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop!" she cried out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice caught the attention of the two men. Upon seeing Harley approach, Calvert's expression suddenly turned anxious. "Go back quickly, don't worry about this place!" he said </span><span>to Harley.</span></p></div>
