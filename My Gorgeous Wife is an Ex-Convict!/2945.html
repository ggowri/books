        <h1>Chapter 2943</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart spent another two days in the hospital before finally being discharged. However, on the day of his release, Valda Theller had already left early. Despite leaving early, she still hid in the shadows and watched as his parents came to pick him up from the hospital, watched as Brian Hart got into the car, and watched as the car drove away from the hospital. She couldn't even explain to herself why she felt the need to hide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she was afraid of facing his parents' awkwardness, or perhaps there were other reasons that she hadn't yet figured out. She needed to think things through before deciding how to face them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the hospital, Valda Theller took a taxi to The Reed residence. She knew that Grace had already been discharged from the hospital and was recuperating at The Reed family's home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she arrived at The Reed residence, Jason Reed had gone to the office and was not at home, and the triplets were all at kindergarten. However, Grace and her newborn daughter were at home. At the moment, Grace was lying in bed, while the baby was lying in the crib, being looked after by a nanny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Grace saw Valda Theller, she smiled and said, "Come on, Valda Theller, sit down!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How are you feeling?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm recovering well. Actually, I'm almost back to my normal self now, but because the doctor advised me to rest more, Jason insists that I spend most of my time in bed and has the servants supervise me," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she said it that way, her face was full of sweetness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked at Grace and hesitated for a moment before saying, "Grace, I have something on my mind that I want to talk to you about privately. Can we?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace noticed her hesitation and dismissed the nanny in the room. "Whatever you want to say, go ahead and say it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's... about Brian Hart," Valda Theller said. "I want to know, in your eyes, what kind of person he is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Grace seemed a little surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know he loved you in the past," Valda Theller said. In fact, he still loves you now, but since she and Brian Hart are still boyfriend and girlfriend in front of Grace, she can't say that. "I'm just curious and want to know more about him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's a very good person," Grace said after thinking for a moment. "Our first encounter was on the mountain..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She slowly recounted their first meeting and subsequent reunion to Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, in my opinion, Brian Hart's feelings for me were sometimes more like a childhood obsession. But now, I'm really happy that he's with you. I can see that he has you in his eyes, and you also love him, don't you?" Grace asked, looking into Valda Theller's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I love him. He's the first person I've loved like this," Valda Theller smiled. It was because of Brian Hart that she realized how deep love for someone could be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, thank you," Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank me? Thank me for what?" Grace asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for saving Brian Hart when we were kids. If you hadn't saved him back then, maybe I wouldn't have met him now," Valda Theller said. "It's because of you that I met Brian Hart, so I'm really grateful to you."</p></div>
