        <h1>Chapter 2183</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow's voice came from the phone. "What's the matter? Are you calling me to talk about the children again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said, "I do need to talk to you about the children. Did my son or daughter drop by your place?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're not asking me for your son and daughter after you lost them, are you?" Philip Barlow quipped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Unexpectedly, Jason replied with four words. "Yes, I lost them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Cough, cough..." A series of coughs sounded from the other end of the line. After a long while, the coughing stopped. "You lost your son and daughter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, let me know if they go to your place," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sure, do you need help looking for them? After all, you're in Deer City, not Emerald City. I have more connections here than you do," said Philip Barlow. After all, Jason had helped raise his son for a while, so he had to repay him somehow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thanks," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Philip Barlow and Jason pulled their own strings to look for the two kids in Deer City. They did not know that the two kids had just jumped out of the taxi and were politely waving goodbye to the driver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Your parents are careless to let you two children take a taxi by yourself. Don't do it again. There might be dire consequences if you run into bad people," the taxi driver said before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Got it. Thank you, Uncle," Jasper answered with a sweet smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed kept silent on the surface. He said to himself that if they did run into bad people, he had a lot of small weapons that would make them regret having evil ideas for the rest of their lives!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two children sneaked up to the outer part of the Barlow family&rsquo;s mansion. Jasper looked blankly at the mansion not far away. 'Is this William's new home?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'It looks like a great place!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Mommy said that William's daddy would give William a nice new home. Will William... be willing to go back to the Reed family&rsquo;s house?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper Reed&rsquo;s excitement suddenly died down as she grew slightly worried. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed took out his small phone and signal enhancement devices. He began working on it with his ten tiny fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper squatted nearby as she watched her older brother work. Although she could not understand what he was doing, she knew her oldest brother was smart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">15 minutes later, all the lights in the Barlow family&rsquo;s mansion went out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The security guards at the gate were startled and started to activate the backup electric supply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">During this period, no one noticed that the two little ones hiding in the shadows had slipped through the railings of the Barlow family&rsquo;s gate without setting off the alarm system.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, Mick Reed had shut down the alarm system!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two little ones entered the Barlow family&rsquo;s mansion just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At the same time, Philip Barlow learned from the security guards that it was not just the electricity that had been cut off but the entire security system. They had been hacked!</p></div>
