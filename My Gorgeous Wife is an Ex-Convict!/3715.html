        <h1>Chapter 3713</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked at the man in front of her, the man she was supposed to call father, who had sold her to someone else for the sake of business.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father knew full well the malicious intentions of the man named Crispin, yet he set the trap and let her fall into it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Mason yesterday, she could only imagine the terrible things that would have happened to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether or not I have contact with him is none of your business!" Veronica retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you say that? If you have contact with him..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer was interrupted by Veronica, "If I have contact with him, then you won't be able to sell me to other men, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean 'sell'? When have I ever sold my daughter?" Archer's face turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't that what happened yesterday? It just didn't work out. If I didn't have contact with Mason, were you planning to continue to offer your daughter to anyone who could bring you business? Are you even worthy of being called a father?" Veronica sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer couldn't bear his daughter's accusations, "I am still your father. I raised you and you should repay me for that."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica finally understood that her previous thoughts were just wishful thinking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, this is the last time I will call you that. I won't consider you my father anymore. </span><span>Our father-daughter relationship ends here! You raised me? Yes, until I was seven, you raised me with my mother's money. After that, it was the Reed family who raised me. As for repaying you, you have already gained enough from me through Mason and the Reed family over the years. I don't owe you anything!" Veronica murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer was so angry that he trembled, "You...you want to sever our father-daughter relationship? Who gave you the courage?!" He shouted and raised his hand to slap Veronica's face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the next moment, his hand was blocked by another hand, and the person who blocked him was none other than Mason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer was surprised and quickly withdrew his hand. "Mason, what are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Mason ignored Archer and looked at Veronica's face. "What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing, just cutting off the father-daughter relationship with him," Veronica said bitterly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason seemed to be thinking about something, and Rosalind quickly said, "Mason, Veronica is just throwing a tantrum. She and her father have an unbreakable blood relationship as father and daughter!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not throwing a tantrum." Veronica looked directly at her father and stepmother. "Blood relationship can be cut off. If there is no father-daughter affection, then blood relationship is useless."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You--" Archer raised his hand and wanted to hit his daughter again, but seeing Mason beside her, he reluctantly put his hand down. "Veronica, let's just say you're talking nonsense. Auntie Rosalind and I will go back first. You rest well."</span></p></div>
