        <h1>Chapter 2283</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said, "Yeah, Kyla. Martin Weiss must really love you, so it all depends on whether you love him or not. If you still love him, you might as well give each other a chance. You can separate if you're really not right for each other. At least you won't regret it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled sadly. "But I'm scared that&hellip; if we separate again after getting back together, I won&rsquo;t be able to get over it like last time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you scared of Martin Weiss betraying you again and causing you harm?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was silent, but the silence meant that Lina had gotten it right. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said, "It depends on whether you believe in his feelings for you. If you do, I think you might as well take a chance. Life has always been a gamble anyway. You never know what your life is going to be like until the end of it. That was what I was thinking when I got together with Hadwin. It's better to just do it than hesitate. At least that&rsquo;s how you won&rsquo;t regret it in the future!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at Lina with some surprise. It was at this moment that she realized that Lina was far more insightful than she thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Among the three of them, Lina seemed to have experienced the least hardships, so she was also the most optimistic. However, compared to Kyla&rsquo;s hesitation and Grace's overthinking, Lina was the wisest and most decisive person!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Kyla, you said you're scared of not being able to get over it if you two separate again&hellip; Doesn't this... mean that you love Martin Weiss? You're even scared of loving him so much more than you did the first time. That's why you're worried that you can't get over it if it happens again, aren't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla paused. 'Do I... love Martin Weiss?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried to deny it but could not utter the words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She asked herself if she loved him. If she did not love him, why was she so heartbroken when she saw him cutting his neck repeatedly and lying on the operating table?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla did not answer, and Grace and Lina did not ask any further questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once the car arrived at the store, the two got off with Kyla. Before leaving, Lina said, "Kyla, we won't interfere in whatever you decide. You have to decide what to do with your feelings yourself. But no matter what happens, Grace and I will be here for you. We're happy for you if you're happy. If you're upset, we'll help you vent your feelings. If you're facing troubles, we'll get through them together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes reddened, and her nose felt sore. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gently patted Kyla's shoulder. "Kyla, Lina and I are your family. We'll face everything together, so don't hesitate too much sometimes. Just follow your heart!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Follow my heart?' Kyla thought of those words after Lina and Grace left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'My heart...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Mrs. Corbyn walked over, looked at her daughter, and said, "Oh, you're discharged from the hospital now, so you're finally safe. It's all thanks to Martin Weiss! Jacqueline Bowman is such a mean person. I was even grateful to her before. I thought she was a nice person!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla gently looked down and said, "She's now in custody in the detention center. The police say that she has a solid case against her. She&rsquo;ll be sentenced to at least five years in prison if proven guilty!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think five years is too lenient. People like her should be sentenced to life in prison. Otherwise, she might harm someone else again when she's released."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn scolded, and Kyla suddenly said, "Mom, do you think Martin Weiss and I are a right fit? What do you think of me getting back together with him?"</p></div>
