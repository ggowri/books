        <h1>Chapter 432</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he turned to the shop assistant. &ldquo;Pack these up.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The shop assistant was more than happy and immediately packed up all the hair accessories with the receipt ready.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason paid for the items and took the bag containing the hair accessories. Grace said nothing to protest because she understood that this was a gift from his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she rejected it, it might make him feel uncomfortable instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s buy some clothes and shoes,&rdquo; he said as if he was on a shopping spree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But I have shoes. We don&rsquo;t need to buy more.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But I want to see you dressed beautifully. Don&rsquo;t you girls have a saying that men earn money for the women to spend? Besides, you used to buy me clothes and shoes last time too.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Okay, she had nothing to refute against this statement of his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was worried that he would splurge on those luxury brands. Thus, she said, &ldquo;Then can I choose what I like?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He smiled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they strolled through the mall, Grace found some clothes and shoes that she liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried them on and thought they looked good. Furthermore, the price was not steep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, she was dressed in a beige long dress. She looked like she was on a summer vacation. She was even wearing matching colored sandals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It had been a long time since she dressed like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace looked into the mirror, she was a little dazed. It was as if she was seeing her old self again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only difference was in the aura she was giving out now compared to in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was like a sharp spear that had been kept away in a dark and humid corner, becoming rusty and dull after its former glory days. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace saw the gaze in her eyes through the reflection in the mirror. The current her had a gaze that was different from when she just came out of prison as well. She no longer looked so lifeless and dull. It was as if the mist covering her gaze was gradually dissipating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it because of Jason? Was it because he brought her hope for the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it was in the past, she would find that hilarious. How could someone who made her lose all hope become the same person who was giving her hope?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; His voice rang beside her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned and realized that he had walked up to her. He was now standing behind her, looking at her reflection in the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their gazes met through the reflection on the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Um, n-not bad,&rdquo; she said. His gaze lit up, making her blush a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s nice too.&rdquo; His lips approached her earlobes as he whispered. To him, she had inexplicably become more and more beautiful which made him find it hard to avert his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her ears reddened as her heart began to beat erratically. &ldquo;Th-then I&rsquo;ll take this. Let me change out of this.&rdquo; She wanted to hurriedly get into the changing room to change out of this dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next moment, he suddenly grabbed her by the wrist.</p></div>
