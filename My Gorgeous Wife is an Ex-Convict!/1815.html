        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked at her. "Why do you want to spend more time with me every day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Because I like you, William! Of course, I want to spend more time with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is it just because I can play the piano?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Um..." Jasper&rsquo;s little face showed that she was deep in thought. "Although I like you because you're good at playing the piano, it's not the only reason. Other children also play the piano well, but I don't like them that much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you don't like me that much anymore one day, are you going to stop being with me?" the young boy asked in a mutter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was no change in expression on his face, but his tight grip betrayed his nervousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper said confidently, "I won't stop liking you! As I said, I want to be with you forever, so stay in this family forever!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Forever... How long is forever?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Come on. I'll play you the new tune!" Jasper dragged him toward the main house again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William did not resist this time. He followed Jasper back to the main house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At this moment, he suddenly felt that it would be great if he could stay in the Reed family forever. That way, he could be with Jasper forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the day of the pregnancy check-up came, Hadwin Stephenson showed up in front of Lina, just as she had expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As for the hundreds of deliveries Hadwin Stephenson had sent her, she told her parents to reject them, saying that someone was pulling her prank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her parents did not suspect anything, but the undisposed packages in her room did give her a headache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina had not seen Hadwin Stephenson for days but thought that he seemed to be a lot thinner now. There was a heavy look of fatigue on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is it because he has been working too hard these days?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You don't need to accompany me to the pregnancy check-up if you're exhausted. I can go by myself," said Lina after clearing her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Although I'm a little tired, I'm not as tired as you think. I can still accompany you to the pregnancy check-up," said Hadwin Stephenson as he raised his hand and rubbed his brows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He had undergone the process to lift the blood curse again last night. The pain seemed to remain in his body. Every time he moved, he felt sore and dull pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">One more session to go. One more session to get rid of the blood curse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the pain would be more intense then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He even fainted several times from the pain last night. The feeling of wishing he was dead had never been stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At that time, he only repeated her name in his head, telling himself again and again to get through it! He could only be with her after getting through this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once they got to the hospital, Lina took the ticket number for her appointment and came to the gynecology department with Hadwin Stephenson. The people here were mostly women, but there were also men who were accompanying their wives or girlfriends here. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked at the ticket number in her hand. She still had to wait a little longer, so she and Hadwin Stephenson found seats in the waiting lounge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Are you sure you're okay?" Lina asked Hadwin Stephenson. He was clearly exhausted.</p></div>
