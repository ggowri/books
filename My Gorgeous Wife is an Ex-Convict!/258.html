        <h1>Chapter 257</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps his gaze was so direct and unabashed that Grace could not help looking up at Jason. She asked him, "Aren't you going to eat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I am. I just want to watch you eat for a while first. I find the food more appetizing when I watch you eat," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." She suddenly felt speechless. What did he mean by that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Every time I watch you eat, the food looks more delicious," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's because you've never tried being hungry," she said with a faint smile. "If you haven't eaten for days, even if it's just white rice in water, you'll find it delicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes froze. "Have you ever been hungry?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, yes," she said lightly. What had been a matter of life and death back then seemed to turn into a casual topic right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips tightened. "Was it in prison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, neither of them spoke anymore. She lowered her head and continued eating while his eyes remained firmly fixed on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was still wearing those cheap clothes today. She lowered her head with a few strands of hair by her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her thin neck and thin body, she was now thinner than the photos in the data he had collected of her before she went to prison. She looked as if the wind would blow her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she was eating with her head down. Every bite was taken with such earnestness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was her earnestness that made him feel sour and sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had known that he was going to meet her and end up caring for her, he would never have let her suffer in prison!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then... He would not have let her go to jail for a crime like that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lowered his head and ate the food in front of him, but when it reached his mouth, the food suddenly seemed to turn a little astringent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the meal, Grace said, "I'm going to the washroom."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go with you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was rendered speechless. Did she need someone to accompany her to the washroom?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It reminded her of her old school days when girls used to go to the washroom in groups.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he wanted to go with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was just standing outside the washroom a few meters away when they reached the washroom's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was relieved. She was afraid that he would go ahead and book all the mall's washrooms so that he could go inside with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went into the washroom and when she finished, she went to the washstand to wash her hands. Suddenly, a voice rang beside her. "Hmm, isn't this... Grace? You&rsquo;re at the mall to shop too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up to see Andrea Schwartz, her former law firm colleague.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the beginning, she and Andrea Schwartz had joined the firm in the same batch. She and Andrea Schwartz got along well. Andrea often cared about her and tried to gain her friendship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she got into that accident, however, Andrea Schwartz stopped caring about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was somewhat awkward meeting her old colleague.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I read in the newspaper that Lily and your ex-boyfriend Sean visited the sanitation service workers at the Sanitation Service Center to give the staff gifts. It seems there were also pictures of you wearing a sanitation service worker's uniform. Are you working as a sanitation service worker now?" Andrea Schwartz said as if she was full of concern.</p></div>
