        <h1>Chapter 4392: He Likes You</h1>
        <div><p>&quot;Just happened to run into him today, and he found out I was going to pick up Quinn. Since Quinn is a fan of his, we went to pick her up together,&quot; Harley explained, then glanced at Chandler&#x27;s perpetually icy face. &quot;Chandler, you&#x27;re not jealous, are you? Don&#x27;t worry, even if Quinn and Tina are fans of Calvert, their favorite is definitely you. Besides... Tina&#x27;s loyalty to her idols... well, it&#x27;s limited.&quot;</p><p>Harley was telling the truth. Although Tina is a fan of celebrities, her loyalty to them doesn&#x27;t last long. She often moves from one star to the next.</p><p>In other words, when it comes to being a fan, Tina is quite the fickle one.</p><p>Chandler glanced at Harley, &quot;Did you break off your engagement with Lornell because of this man?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Cough, cough!&quot; Harley almost choked on his own saliva. Since when did Chandler become such a gossip?</p><p>Moreover, Lornell had asked her about this issue before.</p><p>Back then, her answer was a firm no, and now, it remains the same - &quot;No, he&#x27;s just a friend.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So, is that what he thinks too?&quot; Chandler asked.</p><p>&quot;What do you mean? Chandler, are you suggesting that he befriended me to take advantage of me and gain better resources?&quot; Harley frowned, &quot;Although at first, Calvert did approach me because I had some resources, everything that followed was due to his own hard work and talent. Otherwise, he wouldn&#x27;t have become a sensation in the entertainment industry just by playing a supporting role.&quot;</p><p>After all, there&#x27;s a saying in this circle, small fame comes from hype, big fame comes from destiny!</p><p>After all, even if you have a strong backing and are showered with all kinds of great opportunities, there are still many people who just can&#x27;t make it big.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m not sure if he&#x27;s been using you to gain resources, but one thing I am sure of is that he doesn&#x27;t see you as a friend. The way he looks at you, it&#x27;s the way a man looks at a woman. How many friendships between men and women do you think are purely platonic?&quot; Chandler retorted.</p><p>Harley was taken aback. Could it be that Chandler was implying... Calvert liked her? Like, in the way a man likes a woman?</p><p>Is it possible?</p><p>Over the past couple of years, they&#x27;ve been just friends, and Calvert has never expressed any romantic feelings for her.</p><p>&quot;Chandler, did you... maybe get it wrong?&quot; Harley asked hesitantly.</p><p>&quot;All I did was speak my mind. Whether I&#x27;m wrong or right, it&#x27;s up to you to find out,&quot; Chandler said. &quot;And there&#x27;s one more thing, I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re aware, but Lornell is returning to his home country in a few days!&quot;</p><p>Harley was taken aback, &quot;What, he&#x27;s going back to his country?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I guess you&#x27;ll be staying in Emerald City for a while. Even though you and him have called off the engagement, there are still some occasions where you might inevitably run into each other.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I get it,&quot; Harley said, her eyelashes fluttering slightly. After all, she and Lornell had quite a few mutual acquaintances, and to some extent, they were all part of the same social circle. It was inevitable that they would run into each other from time to time.</p><p>In just over two years, she had completely let go of that once hopeless love.</p><p>At first, it was her who proposed to break off the engagement, simply because she didn&#x27;t want to be trapped in a relationship where she would never get anything in return. And even now, she has no regrets.</p><p>When Harley and Calvert left the Hunter family&#x27;s place, a faint blush still lingered on Calvert&#x27;s face. It seemed that Tina and her daughter had really given him a run for his money.</p></div>
