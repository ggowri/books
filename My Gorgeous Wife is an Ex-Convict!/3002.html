        <h1>Chapter 3000</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taylah felt like she was going to faint!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, Valda and Brian went to look for Mr. Yeats when he didn't come back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fynn wanted to follow, but was deterred by Brian's gaze, so he left awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they walked out of Building 5, Brian asked, "Nothing else happened before I arrived, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, you came just in time," Valda smiled. "If it weren't for you supporting me earlier, my two classmates would have kept talking non-stop."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if I didn't support you, I think you could have handled it," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because they are not people I care about, so whatever they say, I just ignore it," Valda said. "Only the people I care about, whatever they say, I will take it to heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they were talking, they happened to see Zoran Yeats not far away. And at this moment, there was a middle-aged woman dressed in luxury standing next to Zoran Yeats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The middle-aged woman was pointing at Zoran Yeats with a hand wearing a large diamond ring. "I just want you to see what the consequences are when you refused to let my child win the award. Don't think you can get away with it just by changing schools. I want to make sure you can't even be a teacher."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoran Yeats looked unhappy. "I did what I thought was right."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fine, you think you did the right thing. Let's see how you can still be a teacher in the future," the woman said with malice on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda frowned and walked over. The woman noticed Valda and Brian approaching, so she put down her hand and just said to Zoran Yeats, "We'll see about that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying this, the woman left. Valda walked up to Zoran Yeats and said, "Mr. Yeats, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoran Yeats shook his head. "It's nothing, just an unreasonable student's parent." He looked at Brian standing next to Valda and said, "Valda, who is this...?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is my boyfriend Brian," Valda introduced, then turned to Brian and said, "He's the high school art teacher, Mr. Yeats, who encouraged me to pursue a career in comics."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian extended his hand and politely greeted, "Hello, Mr. Yeats. Thank you for helping Valda in high school."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It's worth noting that there aren't many people in Emerald City who can make Brian behave so politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Yeats looked at Brian with some surprise. Having lived to his age, he had seen many people and could naturally tell that Valda's boyfriend was not an ordinary person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But he could also see that Valda's boyfriend must treat her well, because the man's gaze at Valda was full of tenderness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not me, Valda did it herself. My help to Valda was actually very limited," Mr. Yeats said, shaking hands with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, by the way, Mr. Yeats, was that parent earlier the one who demanded their child win an award, but you refused and they reported you to the education bureau?" Valda asked, still a little worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you know?" Zoran Yeats asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I overheard something at the door of the office earlier, so I guessed," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoran Yeats sighed, "Yes, it was that parent. I can't go against my conscience and promise them, it wouldn't be fair to other children. I thought it would end there, but who knew that parent wouldn't let it go and went to the education bureau."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I might be transferred to another school next semester, so if you really want to find me in the future, you'll have to go to another school to find me," Zoran Yeats said with a wry smile, obviously not wanting to cause any trouble for his students. "Alright, come on, tell me about your experiences these past few years..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda followed his lead and began to talk about her own experiences.</p></div>
