        <h1>Chapter 1602</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, it doesn't hurt anymore. So you can stop, Ci," the little girl said, and the little boy was quiet again as he had been at first. However, his hand was firmly in hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Have you been fighting again? Gosh. You even beat them up so badly? What sin have we committed to have a child like you?" The stepmother, Rosalind Bush, scolded as she rushed over. As soon as she saw what was going on, she instantly scolded Mason even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had only walked away for a moment yet this happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The chubby little boy even complained and explained how Mason hurt the other children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With so many adults surrounding them and hearing the criticism from others, the little girl only hugged the little boy tightly while saying, "Ci, don't be afraid. I'll protect you. Don't be afraid!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace found her nose feeling strangely sore when she heard that. Just as she was about to say something to help the two children, Jason hurried to Grace with their two children. "Grace, I'm afraid we have to go back first. We've found Secretary Wang!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What?" Grace was shocked. "Secretary Wang? You... found him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, we've found him! Terrence said they've confirmed that it's indeed Secretary Wang. He's right here in Emerald City!" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Secretary Wang...' Grace staggered a little. 'They've found Secretary Wang. Does that mean we'll find out the whereabouts of the other child too?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace instantly grabbed Jason by the wrist. "Take... Take me there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, I'll take you there," said Jason. Then, he told the two children, "Mommy and I have something to do today. I'll bring you to the amusement park again next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed nodded her head sensibly. Even Jasper did not make a fuss about continuing playing. Even though she was young, she could see that her mother was going to see a very important person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When they got in the car, Jasper asked, "Mommy, is that Secretary Wang someone important?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, he is," Grace's hand trembled faintly as she answered her daughter. How could he not be important?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If it had not been for Secretary Wang, she and Jay would have been just fine. They would not only have two of their three children with them, not to mention go through five years of separation and memory loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All this pain was because of what Secretary Wang did back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... what puzzled her was that according to Terrence, Secretary Wang was committed to carrying out the old master's order. He was supposed to let her die in front of Jay and kill all of Jay's hopes, so why was she saved in the end?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, Secretary Wang also gave Mick to the Reed family and kept Jasper by her side?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They probably would not get the answer until Secretary Wang was found.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mommy, you're shaking. Are you cold?" Jasper asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, I'm not cold. I'm just too excited," said Grace. If she did not have the children by her side, she might be even more upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After sending the two children back to Reed Residence, Grace and Jason rushed to where Secretary Wang was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They found Secretary Wang in an ordinary rental house. Jason's men were already guarding the house, and Terrence was also waiting outside. As soon as he saw Jason and Grace, he came forward and said, "Young master Reed, he's in the house. But he won&rsquo;t tell us the child's whereabouts.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together tightly while Grace's hands trembled again.</p></div>
