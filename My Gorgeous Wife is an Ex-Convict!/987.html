        <h1>Chapter 986</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Earlier when he saw them staring into each other's eyes as he stood at the diner's entrance, he felt as if his world was falling apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if they were in a world of their own where she could only see Brian! He could not get in no matter what and was left out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared coldly at Brian and said, "What a pity. She won't love you back." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled faintly and said, "She may not love me now, but what about the future? How can you be so sure that she won't fall for me? Jason, who are you to tell me this? You and Grace have broken up, haven&rsquo;t you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I gave you a chance. I gave up more than once. Besides, you're the one who chose to break up with Grace. I won't give up again this time," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason suddenly burst into anger and laughed. "You won't give up again? Haha... Are you going to risk the Hart family then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his eyebrows slightly. "Are you going to risk the Reed family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men stared at each other, and the air felt tense again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a shudder, the owner served the two dishes Brian ordered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he did not know who the three of them were, it was clear from the fact that they had blocked the diner's door that they were no ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Boss, get us a bottle of your best liquor here," Brian said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay. Coming right up," replied the owner. After a while, he came back with a bottle of liquor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although it was only a diner, he would occasionally get customers who liked to order pricier liquor, so he kept some decent liquor in stock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the liquor they had was far from what Brian and Jason usually drank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian poured the liquor into his glass anyway and looked at Jason. "Want some? Speaking of which, I haven't had a good drink with you in a long time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason seemed to be smiling as the corners of his lips were raised slightly, but there was no joy in his eyes. "Indeed, it's been a long time since we had a good drink together, so let's do it today." He took the bottle from Brian's hand and poured the liquor into his glass.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men drank at the small dining table, looking like they were enjoying themselves. However, the look in their eyes told a different story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, the woman kept eating with her head down until she finished her bowl of rice. Then, she raised her head to look at the two men in front of her and said, "I've finished eating, so I gotta go now. You guys can go on. Dinner's on me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stood up and went straight to the owner. "How much is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah? 378 dollars," said the owner, then as if fearing Grace would doubt him, he quickly added, &ldquo;That bottle of liquor costs 230 dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace paid 378 dollars with her phone and walked out of the diner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several people were on guard outside, keeping other customers from entering. Passersby were glancing sideways at the diner as if wondering what was going on inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but laugh. The temporary closure of a shop might seem like a big deal to most people, but not to Jason and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way they valued things and the way they were brought up was different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Earlier at the dinner table, she thought she had been chewing on wax. She never expected to treat them to dinner tonight.</p></div>
