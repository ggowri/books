        <h1>Chapter 4406: Awakening</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by 'friends with benefits'? What is that!" Harley quickly retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, if two people are together and they don't need to take responsibility for each other, isn't that just friends with benefits?" Karen retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're not in... um, that kind of relationship," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you sure?" Karen looked at Hao You skeptically, "I mean, you've seen a lot of handsome guys in the entertainment industry, but Calvert isn't bad looking either. Plus, I've noticed he's been getting more and more handsome these past two years. Don't you think he </span><span>sometimes gives off this isolated yet pitiful vibe?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"..." Suddenly, in Harley's mind, the image of that day she went to save Calvert flashed. Calvert's face was flushed, yet his eyes were misty.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, my heart started pounding again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I also saw in a magazine that he's been described by many female netizens as the man they most want to swoon over. It's impressive that despite his fame, he hasn't been involved in any scandals, and there's no talk of him being particularly close to any woman... well, except for you," Karen added. "So, even if you don't have any intentions with him now, are you sure it will stay that way in the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley looked at Hao You with a hint of embarrassment, "Let's... just go with the flow in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seem to really like Calvert, don't you?" Karen said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was taken aback, "I really like him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else could it be? With your cautious nature, you just broke off an engagement two years ago. Would you jump into another pit so quickly? You say you don't need to be responsible for each other with Calvert, that he can go find other women. But when he really finds someone else, can you truly be indifferent? Can you immediately revert back to being just friends?" Karen said bluntly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was silent. The mere thought of Calvert being with other women made her uncomfortable, even causing a faint stabbing pain in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, seize the day!" Karen patted her friend's shoulder, grinning mischievously. "If you want to confirm whether you really like him or not, just go on a date with him. That should clear things up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In today's society, things are not like they used to be. If two people willingly engage in a relationship before marriage, there's nothing wrong with that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Harley's face suddenly turn red? Did she eat Calvert?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the time she snapped back to reality, she had unknowingly arrived at Calvert's apartment door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These past few days, Calvert has put all his work on hold due to medication, and has been staying in his apartment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She knew the apartment's passcode, so at that moment, she punched in the code and entered the apartment herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There's no one in the living room, so they must be in the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley headed towards Calvert's bedroom. When she reached the door, she knocked twice but received no response. So, she knocked harder, making a louder noise, and called out, "Calvert? Are you there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Still no response. Harley pushed open the bedroom door, hearing a muffled groan, as if something was being suppressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she noticed the quilt on the bed was moving, clearly indicating that he was completely wrapped up under it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that he's not feeling well, or something happened to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley rushed over, asking, "Calvert, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell? Do you need me to take you to the hospital again...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before her words even had a chance to fade, the blanket was suddenly lifted from within. A pair of arms reached out from under the blanket, and abruptly wrapped around her waist.</span></p></div>
