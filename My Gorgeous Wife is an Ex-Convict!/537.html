        <h1>Chapter 536</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," said Jason. It was no trouble for him to take one more child to the premiere. "Are you sure he can understand a movie?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought about it. It seemed that the main appeal of the film was that it was for both young and old, though Nelson was a little younger and did not know much about sounds nor languages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, watching a movie... Um, was always a new experience. Plus, she would be able to whisper hints or speak sign language to express what was happening on the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found it a lot more fun with that in mind! She looked forward to seeing Nelson watch the movie later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace spoke in sign language and asked the little one whether he had seen a movie before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the little one shook his head and said he had not seen any.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you and I go watch a movie later?" asked Grace as she used sign language to speak. She was afraid the little one would not understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one nodded his head, his face lighting up with excitement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although the little one knew about movies only in the literal sense, his face was expectant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Nelson&rsquo;s excited face, Grace could not help feeling a bit sorry. If only they were watching an animation with Nelson today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Nelson was interested in movies, then she would watch animated movies with him next time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove to the premiere, but it did not stop at the main entrance. After all, there were quite a few reporters at the main entrance right now. Jason knew that Grace did not like to attract the news media's attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, he had always disliked reporters himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A security guard was waiting at the side door. As soon as Jason's car arrived, he respectfully opened the car door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, Grace, and Nelson got out of the car and went inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were no reporters inside, just celebratory wreaths in the auditorium and guests in attendance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As far as Grace could see, these people were all familiar&mdash;top celebrities one would see on the screen, some well-known local directors, and even some people you would normally only see in political news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. Although Howell Webb was now quite popular, Howell Webb seemed to be far from having such an impact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On second thought, it suddenly became clear to her that the director of this film was one of the three famous directors in the industry. They had won many honors abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, it was clear that many of the big shots attending the premiere were doing the director favors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Grace got a lot of attention at the last banquet, there was also a lot of chatter in the high society about how they should not offend Jason's new girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, at the end of the day, it was not something everyone knew about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, Grace was lining up alongside Jason with a child. They were a sight that attracted a lot of attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In particular, those who knew Jason felt like their eyes were popping out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was going on? Why was Emerald City's fearsome Young Master Reed now attending such an event with a child?</p></div>
