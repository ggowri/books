        <h1>Chapter 1279</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Grace asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Repeat what you said to me in the car today," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused, thought about it, and said, "Jay, I do want you. You told me not to touch you if I'm not attracted to you. So now that I've touched you, it means I'm attracted to you. Is that what you want to hear?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, say it again," he repeated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not reject his request and repeated the same thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She kept repeating the same lines over and over again while he listened as he hugged her. After a long time, he finally said, "Is it true that you still have me in your heart, that you still love me, and that you had never gotten over me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it&rsquo;s always been you. So I didn't hate it when you kissed me. I wasn't sure if I was still in love with you before this, but I realized that I was when Brian asked me today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace confessed, "Jay, a lot has happened between us. Our relationship has also been severely damaged. I don't know if it will ever be the same, but I'll try to fix it. What about you? Are you willing to do the same?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stiffened a little. "Do you want me... to love you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yesh," she answered. She loved him and naturally hoped he could love her too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He slowly straightened his body, and those dark eyes had a yellowish gleam in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter if it's not as deep as it used to be, but... I hope you&rsquo;ll at least have some affection for me. You kissed me because you still love me, right?" she added. She stammered as she spoke under his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took her right hand and looked down at it. Moments later, he dragged her out of the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are you taking me?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace to the study and took out Frozen Heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned when she saw the ring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Frozen Heart. She had seen it before, but Frozen Heart had not been set yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, Frozen Heart was already set into a ring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The ring was the wedding ring he had chosen for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took her hand and put Frozen Heart on the ring finger of her right hand. "Grace, I will love you and remain loyal to you as long as you love me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The deep and magnetic voice escaped his mouth. It was a vow and a promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he lowered his head, and his lips fell upon the dazzling ring. He kissed it reverently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could let down his guard and lay down his heart for her. If she was willing to love him, he could once again lay all that he had at her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I guess Jason and I are starting over,' Grace thought to herself. Her face could not help blushing at the thought of him changing in front of her this morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had unconsciously turned her face away while he changed, but he walked up to her and turned her face toward him, saying, "Didn't you say you want to love me? Then take a good look at me."</p></div>
