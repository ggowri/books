        <h1>Chapter 2857</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he wanted to lead her into the mansion when she suddenly lunged forward and wrapped her arms around his waist, burying her face deep in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stiffened as he looked at her with surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't... push me away. Just let me hold you for a while, okay? I want to hold you like this right now." Her voice was hoarse and choking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did something happen?" he asked. The air around him seemed gloomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said nothing, but the arms holding him tightened slightly, and their bodies grew closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian did not ask any more questions. He raised one arm and put it around her waist while the other caressed her hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two quietly hugged each other like two people needing comfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's face pressed on Brian's chest. All she could smell was his scent. It was as if holding him like this would make her feel safe and warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was in university, she had told herself to be strong because all she could depend on was herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not help wanting to depend on him. It would be best if she could rely on him for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a long time, Valda Theller finally let go. "Alright, thank you. I feel much better. I'm going home now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait, what happened?" Brian grabbed her and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller sighed. "It's nothing. It's just that I went to my uncle's house today. He asked me for money again, saying he&rsquo;s ill. They'll probably think of me as an ingrate if I don't pay them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned slightly. "Is your uncle sick?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "I don't know if it's true. I wanted to see Uncle's medical records and examination reports, but they refused. Maybe they think I can be their ATM because I'm dating you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Would you like me to handle it for you?" he asked, not wanting to see her so down. Things that money could fix were nothing to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller shook her head and said, "No, I can handle it myself. If I need you to handle every little problem, depending on you will become a habit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't mind you always depending on me," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A trance flickered in Valda Theller's eyes. 'Always... sounds like a beautiful promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does he understand what it means to say that word to a woman?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I mind. I don't want to be dependent on others." Valda Theller smiled. "If I can't handle it, I&rsquo;ll ask for your help, but I want to handle it myself now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Alright, I'll send you home, then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. You're already home. I'll take a taxi. It's convenient," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me take you home." Brian insisted, pulled her to the car, and opened the front passenger door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller bit her lip slightly at this. "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two got into the car, and Brian drove toward Valda Theller's place. She peered at him out of the corners of her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not that she feared making a habit out of being dependent on him. It was just that if they ever broke up one day, she might forget how to live independently.</p></div>
