        <h1>Chapter 2596</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss quietly looked at the woman in front of him. She was right. He did have feelings that he could not control for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The feelings were something she could use against him at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that my actions have misled you. You'd better listen well. I saved you not because I still have any feelings for you, but because I wanted to fulfill a promise to my former self," his cold voice muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Promise?" She froze. "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It means that I had left a letter to myself before the hypnosis because I was afraid that the hypnosis might affect my memory or change my mindset. In the letter, I begged myself to save your life at all costs, even if I had no affection for you," Martin Weiss said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he did not tell her was that he must have been afraid that her childbirth was risky when he wrote the letter, so he kept reminding himself to save her life. If he did not save her, he would surely be more miserable than death if the hypnosis was undone one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Would the hypnosis be undone? He did not think it was possible to undo the hypnosis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was not the letter that brought him to the operating table to save her. It was just that... he did not want to see her die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was no need to tell her this because he planned to keep her in the dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His feelings for her were only lingering ones. It was just that he had loved her so deeply in the past that his mood was easily affected by her. It was also why he was reluctant to see something happen to her when she was in danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he saw her less or did not see her in the future, the lingering feelings would gradually fade away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I saved you because I loved you back then, but that's all it is..." he said as he stared at her. He stopped abruptly when he saw the tears rolling down her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her tears were crystal clear. They hit his chest like a boulder, and the rest of his words were blocked. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, you really loved me," muttered Kyla. He even left such a letter before the hypnosis to ask himself to save her life at all costs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How deep was his love for her? Her insistence at that time had caused two people who loved each other to end up this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anyway, I don't love you anymore. Divorce would be the best thing for us!&rdquo; he said gruffly after a while, trying to suppress the uncomfortable feeling in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla cried harder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I don't want a divorce?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you'll only be delaying it a little longer. The court will eventually rule the divorce," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sniffled, raised her hand, and wiped the tears from her eyes as she stared fixedly at the person in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face was indifferent. Those dark eyes were so deep that it was impossible to guess what was on his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So... why don't we make another bet?" she whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Bet? What bet?" He raised his eyebrows slightly as he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath and said, "Let's bet if you'll fall in love with me again. Three months. I only want three months. I want to stay with you for these three months. If you still want a divorce after three months, I&rsquo;ll sign the divorce papers to end our marriage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He narrowed his eyes. "Are you kidding? Why would I bet on that with you? I can still divorce you even without the bet."</p></div>
