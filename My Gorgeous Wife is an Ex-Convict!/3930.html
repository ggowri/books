        <h1>Chapter 3928</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy grabbed the other person's wrist and said, "What, do you want me to hit you again? Aren't you afraid of what Mick will do to the Schultz family if you lay a hand on me again? If the Schultz family is gone, what are you, the Schultz family's little miss, worth?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she became a person who bullies others by flaunting her power.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she watched Clarissa's increasingly ugly face, Nancy felt not only the pleasure of revenge, but also a sense of sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to get back at Clarissa, even if it was just with words, but even so, she had to use Mick's name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for herself, she had no capital to get back at Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the Schultz family really wanted to crush her, she wouldn't even have the ability to resist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You--" Clarissa glared at Nancy, suddenly her eyes seemed to see something, her body began to tremble, struggling desperately to break free from Nancy's grip, "You... let go, it's not my business!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy felt that Clarissa's current appearance was a bit strange. Did she see something? Behind her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking this, Nancy was about to turn her head to look behind her, when suddenly, a cold voice sounded in her ear, "What, got hit again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was startled and turned to look at Mick, who had walked up to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How did he get here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When did he arrive? How much of her conversation with Clarissa did he hear?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even if he only heard the last bit, he would know that she was using his name to bully Clarissa. Thinking of this, a hint of embarrassment flashed across Nancy's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick had already raised his hand and touched the side of her face where Clarissa had hit her just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because Clarissa's strength is not small, one side of her face is already swollen and red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does it hurt?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In fact, this kind of pain is nothing new to her. Back in the Schultz family, Clarissa often liked to slap people, and she naturally often got slapped by Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it were a normal day, she would say "it doesn't hurt much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But today... She glanced at Clarissa, who had turned pale, and suddenly changed her mind. She said to Mick, "It hurts a lot. I didn't expect her to suddenly rush over and slap me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really? It seems like every time I see you, you're getting slapped by her," Mick said with a hint of teasing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was a bit speechless herself. Come to think of it, it was true. Of the four times she had seen him, three times she had been slapped by Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, if she ever lays a hand on you again, how do you think I should deal with her and the Schultz family? Without the Schultz family, this Schultz family's little missy wouldn't be anything, would she?" Mick said idly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's heart skipped a beat. He must have heard her conversation with Clarissa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, was he now mocking her for her false bravado?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A hint of embarrassment appeared on Nancy's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Clarissa was so scared that she hurriedly said, "Mr. Reed, you... you must have been deceived by her. She's a liar who tells nothing but lies. Our family raised her and treated her with the utmost kindness, but she still blames her mother's death on the Schultz family. She just wants to extort more money from the Schultz family. Please don't believe her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa desperately defended herself, but Mick seemed to pay no attention to what she said. He just looked at Nancy and said, "What do you say? Do you want to hit her back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he spoke, he raised his hand, and the two bodyguards behind him immediately pinned Clarissa down.</p></div>
