        <h1>Chapter 4140</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina walked towards the private room. Because there was some distance between the parking lot and the private room, it took her about ten minutes for the round trip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, when she arrived at the door of the private room and pushed it open, she found that there was no one inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Did it end so quickly? Tina was somewhat surprised!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But what puzzled her was that even though it ended, there were no waiters coming in to clean up. At the same time, she quickly found her phone on the table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as she was about to leave, she suddenly heard a faint sound coming from a separate room connected to the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That separate room was specifically prepared for guests in the private room to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Could it be that someone hasn't left yet? Tina was thinking about it when suddenly, she heard a familiar voice coming from the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Perkins, please don't do this..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What do you mean? Are you pretending again? Since your father allowed you to attend this dinner today, he should know that you can only get resources by serving me well!" Mr. Perkins' voice also came from the separate room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I wanted the resources, but I didn't intend to do it this way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Feeling self-righteous, aren't you? You're just a bastard he brought back. Your father told me that I can treat you any way I want! If you refuse, not only will you lose the resources, but how will you explain it to your father later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Silence fell inside the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And outside, Tina couldn't help but clench her fists. It was actually... arranged by Kit's father?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">That seemingly smiling and good-tempered elder would actually arrange such a despicable thing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So you better listen to me obediently and don't think you're all powerful now that you have wings. Once your father abandons you, everything you've worked so hard to achieve will vanish. A star, huh! Hide away for a few years and see who remembers you!" Mr. Perkins' sleazy voice rang out once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Immediately after, Tina heard whispers and the sound of something being bumped inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Without hesitation, Tina kicked open the door to the compartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Who is it? Didn't I tell you not to disturb me?!" Mr. Perkins angrily turned around because of the noise, but his expression suddenly changed when he saw Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina's expression also changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All she saw was Kit being pressed down by Mr. Perkins, with clear marks on his face. It was evident that the sound of collision she had heard earlier was Mr. Perkins hitting Kit!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You&mdash;" Tina, with anger on her face, rushed forward and directly raised her hand to hit Mr. Perkins repeatedly. "Don't you know how important a face is to a star? And what are you doing? Forcing others to do something they don't want to? Fine, I'll give you what you want. Let me beat you until I'm satisfied!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina's hand hurt from the punches, as if she was beating a leather bag.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Caught off guard, Mr. Perkins could only defend himself passively, but Tina also had some skills, thanks to Hadwin and Chandler. They had taught her some martial arts throughout her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if it was just fancy footwork, she still had some self-defense ability.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And at this moment, this fancy footwork was enough to deal with Mr. Perkins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Before long, Mr. Perkins was beaten down by Tina and she couldn't help but kick him a few more times. Then, she looked at Kit, who was shocked beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How... are you hurt?" Tina asked.</p></div>
