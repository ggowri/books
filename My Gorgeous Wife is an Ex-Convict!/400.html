        <h1>Chapter 399</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">God, did he know how evocative his words were?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to touch me?" His voice and the way he tilted his chin slightly back seemed like the most intense form of seduction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... No thanks..." stammered Grace. She felt her blood pressure spiking again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" He smiled a little, though there was a hint of disappointment on his face. Suddenly, he changed the subject and said, "By the way, you have Saturday afternoons off, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, why?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Make yourself available this Saturday afternoon. I'll take you to the hospital for a physical examination," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A physical examination?" Grace was a little surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You haven't had a physical examination in years, so go down and get one this Saturday. It's always necessary to have an annual physical examination," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip slightly, then nodded. "All right." Her company used to arrange physical examinations for the employees when she was still with the law firm. However, she had not had a physical examination in nearly four years since her imprisonment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she thought about it, there was nothing wrong with getting a physical examination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At night, when Grace was about to go to sleep, Jason said he wanted to sleep in the same room with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes widened immediately. "You... You're going to sleep here too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there a problem? Didn't we sleep in the same bed when we were in the rental house?" he said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The question was would it be the same? Back then, she looked at him as if he was her brother. Now, he was her boyfriend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blushed and glared at Jason. "I'm used to... sleeping alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nonsense. You told me you like the feeling of me sleeping with you." He caught her lie straight out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was speechless and could only scold herself for saying such things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no choice but to go straight at it and say, "We... We've only just started dating, and I'm not ready for that yet, so... So let's..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ready for that? What do you mean by that, Sis?" A chuckle escaped from his mouth. "Do you mean you want to do the things couples do with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lowered his body as he spoke, his face close to hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace blushed harder and tried to say something, but her voice seemed to be stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers caressed her cheek. "Sis, you can rest assured that I'm just sleeping with you like how we used to at the rental house. I won't force you to do anything if you don't want to, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice paused as his lips moved close to her ear. His breathing was fragrant like orchids. "You can do whatever you want with me anytime. If you want me, you can have me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only feel her heart go into a frenzy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"May I, Sis? I just want to be as close to you as before. Besides, we're boyfriend and girlfriend now, aren't we?" he muttered in a voice that seemed to have some kind of pleading-like coquetry.</p></div>
