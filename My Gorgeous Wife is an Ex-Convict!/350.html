        <h1>Chapter 349</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all... Lina had not experienced too much of the dark side, unlike her who had seen so much darkness in the prison that she sometimes did not even have the strength to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Poof!" Lina spat out the pudding which she had not yet swallowed and quickly took a tissue to wipe it. Then, she said to Grace, "At least joke when I'm not eating, Grace. You're taking the joke too far."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I mean it," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They stared at each other for a long time before Lina laughed and said, "We're not meant for each other even if he's really still in love with me. What kind of family do you think the Stephenson family is? If I get together with him, then the rest of my life will be one big internal fight in a wealthy family. With my skills, I reckon I'll be beaten to bits in a minute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Uh, just forget about it. Once she paid off her &lsquo;debt&rsquo; to Hadwin, she would be free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's not talk about it. By the way, you said you got a new job. How is it? Everything all right?" said Lina as she changed the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not bad. It's a small restaurant. The salary is 4,000 dollars a month. It's not much, but the owner is nice and I get along well with the other employees," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's great, but your current job isn't sustainable. You're a brilliant student. Have you ever thought of getting some other certificate so that when the time comes you can get a different job?" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a wry smile. "I can't even get a job as a receptionist. Even if I do get a certificate, it won&rsquo;t be of any use."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was taken aback. After all that was said and done, it was because her best friend had a criminal record. Her best way out was by reversing her case!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll keep an eye on the witness I mentioned last time. The private detective said that he can help me find something substantial soon. Once we get the evidence, we'll go to S City to get to the bottom of this," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right." Grace looked gratefully at her best friend who had been with her since her accident. Only Lina still thought she was innocent, even when everyone thought she committed the crime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's there to thank? It's my pleasure!" Lina then quipped, "I'm still waiting for you to make a lot of money and take care of me after your case is reversed. Then all I have to do is just enjoy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but smirk at this. "All right, then I'll take care of you and make you fat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina propped her face with her hands as she looked at the smile on her friend&rsquo;s face. She could not help saying, "You look great when you smile, Grace. Your smile seems to make people feel relieved. You should smile more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Smile more? Grace could not help but sigh to herself... Since when did laughter become a luxury for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They ate some more and talked. Then, Lina's phone rang. When the call was over, Lina looked helplessly at her best friend. "My mom called again. I have to hurry and go for my blind date. Let's get together again next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," replied Grace as she watched her best friend leave. She envied her best friend's worries. She did not even have a mother to urge her to go for a blind date.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina hurried over to the location stated in the message sent by her mother. At the agreed supermarket door, she saw a man who looked similar to the photo her mother had shown her. He was standing at the door as if he was waiting for someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought about it and dialed his phone number. Then, she heard his phone ring.</p></div>
