        <h1>Chapter 1638</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, that confidence was rapidly crumbling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Instead of giving me real power, turning me into a titular president would be in the Jackson family's best interest. It would also be more reassuring to you, wouldn't it?" Hadwin Stephenson asked with a faint smile, but his eyes were frosty. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson trembled a little. She had always been calculating and arrogant, thinking everything was under her control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she now realized that everything was actually under the control of the man before her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He knew exactly what she and the Jackson family were planning, but the illusion he put on had kept confusing her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he had been too submissive or obsequious, she would have been suspicious. However, over the past five years, his behavior, struggle, desire for power, and mixed feelings for her... made her put her guard down!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This man was too scheming!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Awfully scheming!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson turned around without saying a word! There was no need for her to stay any longer. She needed to think of a counterplan as soon as possible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, his men stopped her when she reached the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, what's the meaning of this?" asked Katherine Jackson as she glared at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Nothing. I just want you to stay here for a few days," Hadwin Stephenson said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson's expression instantly changed. "Are you going to detain me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Of course not. As a boyfriend, I just want my girlfriend to stay here for a few days. You&rsquo;ll be free when all is said and done in a few days," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson's heart sank instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'A few days... so he already has a plan?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm not staying here." She tried to force her way through, but the two men blocked her left and right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Take Miss Jackson to the room we prepared and keep an eye on her. Don't let her leave that room these few days," Hadwin Stephenson said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His men responded and forcibly took Katherine Jackson away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson felt a chill in her heart when she suddenly realized that he already knew she would come to him. He had even prepared a room to lock her in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How could I... have thought I could control this man so easily?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, Katherine Jackson panicked!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The living room was quiet again. Hadwin Stephenson looked down slightly, muttering, "Lina, I won't spare anyone who has hurt you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Anyone who had hurt her would pay the price, including... himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina asked for leave from the office. She and her parents were alone in the apartment these days. Every day, Hadwin Stephenson's men would deliver their daily necessities and clean up the garbage before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The internet and other communications in the apartment were working fine, so Lina could still keep herself up to date with what was going on outside.</p></div>
