        <h1>Chapter 543</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace watched as the little one fell silent and made another sign gesture. The little one held out his hand with a cochlear implant in his palm, or to be exact, a part of the cochlear implant which was supposed to be placed in the outer ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Nelson lost his cochlear implant?' thought Grace. She began to communicate with Nelson in sign language.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a bit of exchange, Grace finally figured out what was going on. Sure enough, Nelson lost his cochlear implant. Then, when he was halfway back, he realized he could not hear anything when the staff answered his phone. As such, he rushed back to the restroom to look for the cochlear implant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, in the restroom, the little one ran into an uncle, but he could not communicate with him because he did not know sign language.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Nelson was smart. He dipped his finger in the water and wrote on the counter, telling the uncle that he wanted to go back to the room and find someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man then asked Nelson to lead the way and said he would escort him back to the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, Nelson met a good person. If he had met someone with ill intentions, he might be kidnapped and trafficked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace straightened up and said to the man standing next to Nelson, "Thank you, Sir..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her voice sounded like she was being strangled. Her words were stuck in her throat. Her eyes were fixed on the man in front of her as if she had seen something unbelievable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do we know each other?" asked Martin Weiss, frowning slightly. The woman before him should be a stranger to him, but the way she was looking at him made him think she knew him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She knew him! Of course, she knew Martin Weiss. He was Nelson's biological father! Who would have thought that the father and son would meet under such circumstances?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... They did not know each other's identity!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was at a loss for words to describe her current state of mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Jason answered for her. Jason walked over to Grace's side, putting his hand around her shoulders. He smiled at Martin Weiss before saying, "I didn't expect to see you here, President Weiss. I'm Jason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Reed Group's Jason?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," answered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What a coincidence. I wanted to see if there's any possibility of a cooperation between our two companies with my visit to Emerald City this time, and now we&rsquo;re meeting," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right. If you want to visit me some other day, I&rsquo;ll certainly be waiting," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men shook hands, and Jason said, "My girlfriend has seen you on the news before. She probably got a little too surprised seeing you in person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason helped Grace smooth things over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had finally come to her senses and greeted Martin Weiss. "Hello, Mr. Weiss, my name&rsquo;s Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, Miss Cummins." Martin Weiss sized Grace up a little more. After all, there were not many women who could get such a serious introduction from Jason.</p></div>
