        <h1>Chapter 2005</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is Jasper back?' He could not help wondering. However, after a long time passed, it was silent again outside and the figure he was expecting did not appear in his room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Disappointment could not help spreading across his chest. William curled his tiny body tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His bed... seemed colder!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He recalled the words of the man he should call his father. "You're just relying on the Reed family's charity here. Besides, your mother was the person who had hurt them. Even if you're unwilling to leave Jasper and return to Deer City, someday you'll realize you can only get what you want by returning to Deer City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, what he wanted was to keep Jasper company. If she liked him playing the piano, he would keep playing it. It did not matter even if all ten of his fingers hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William fell asleep in a daze. However, he kept dreaming about his mother, how she got arrested, how she lay cold in the ice coffin in the detention center, and how she had said to him... &lsquo;You and Jasper will never be friends.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Will never be friends...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Will never be friends...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The words frightened him like a curse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'We'll be friends. We will be!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Jasper said we're friends!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the endless darkness of his dream seemed to envelop him, leaving him at a loss. It was as if he was the only one left in the whole world, making him feel so lonely and so cold!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is there someone who can help me dispel the darkness? Anyone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I don't want to be alone! I... I'm scared. Can anyone help me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"William, William..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A young and melodious voice rang in his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Who's calling me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William opened his eyes in a daze, only to see a beautiful little face. Before he knew it, a pair of small hands had already pressed on his cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Wow, your face is so cold. Let me warm it up for you," said Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stared blankly at the face so close to him. Her hands were warm as if dispelling the chill in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, get up. It's time to go to kindergarten!" said Jasper Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William got out of bed and began to change his clothes. "Why didn't you come... last night?" he asked a little hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper said, "I fell asleep when we came home yesterday, so Daddy put me in my room. But I brought you a present yesterday! They had chocolate so delicious I made Mommy buy a box for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She looked so happy as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He pressed his small lips together but did not tell her that he did not really like chocolate. He only liked chocolate because she liked it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the way to the kindergarten, Jasper brought the chocolate to William. She opened one and said, "Ah, open your mouth. It's delicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He opened his mouth and ate the chocolate she gave him. The sweetness spread in his mouth. It was so sweet... So sweet...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If only things could forever stay like this!</p></div>
