        <h1>Chapter 3098</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that case, it means he really fell in love with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now... even if he repeatedly says that he loves her, he won't use the word "love" out of pity or guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But is there really none? Perhaps he himself is not even aware.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda bent down and helped Brian pull the thin blanket before turning around and slowly walking towards her own bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she didn't notice that behind her, a pair of phoenix eyes had quietly opened and were fixedly staring at her back...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the next few days, many people came to visit Valda at her apartment. Among them were Kyla and her family, Lina Sweeney and Hadwin Stephenson, as well as some of the staff from the magazine where Valda used to contribute, and Valda's two assistants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They all exclaimed about Valda's luck, surviving under such strong water currents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This time we were really lucky," Kyla exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, it was definitely lucky. It feels like we used up all the luck we'll ever have in our lives," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you talking about? You'll have more luck in the future," Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda smiled and whispered, "By the way, how are you and Mr. Weiss doing?" At that moment, Martin and Brian were chatting in the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since your accident, our relationship has improved a bit. Maybe we both realized that life is unpredictable and we want to change our situation," Kyla said. "But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But he still cares about the past. After all, we've been through too much together. In this world, nothing is easy. Breaking up was hard, and being together is just as hard," Kyla murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although over the past year, their relationship had gradually become like that of an ordinary couple, with warmth and harmony, even if they occasionally argued, they quickly made up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she also understood that everything was like walking on thin ice. One misstep and they could fall into the icy water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin Weiss had not recovered his hypnotized memories, and those memories were like time bombs. She didn't even know if he would never recover or if he would recover better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Every time they had a moment of warmth, she always felt uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knows how much he used to love her before. But what about now? Does he really still love her or is it just because she was someone he used to love? Is it because they already have two children together?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is it because he's tired and doesn't want to be bothered by love anymore?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had no answers to any of these.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, what about you? Now that you're back alive, when are you planning to marry Brian? I'm looking forward to attending your wedding," Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's expression darkened as she said, "I... haven't thought about getting married."</p></div>
