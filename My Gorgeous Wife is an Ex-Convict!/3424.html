        <h1>Chapter 3422</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the living room now, only Rosalind and Veronica remain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rosalind smiled and said, "Veronica, it seems like you haven't been as close to Mason as before. Has something happened between you two?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at Rosalind strangely and said, "I don't understand what you mean, Aunt Rosalind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Rosalind smiled and said, "Remember how Mason used to always be in your room before? He wouldn't leave until it was time to sleep. But lately, it seems like you've been leaving your room earlier than usual."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He finished his homework and naturally left my room. Besides, I also need my own alone time," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Actually, this is intentional on her part. She doesn't want Mason to spend all his time around her. She hopes he can use some of his time for his own hobbies. So sometimes, after finishing homework, she'll make an excuse to go to bed early or say she wants to do something alone and quietly, and let him go back to his own room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I see," Rosalind said thoughtfully, "although you need some alone time, Auntie just wants to remind you that even though Mason is like a brother to you, he's not actually your real brother. He's the second son of the Reed family, so you mustn't cause any rifts with him. If he goes back to the Reed family, things won't be as good for us in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know he's the second son of the Reed family, but to me, he's just my little brother," Veronica looked straight at Rosalind and said. "Besides, even if Mason goes back to the Reed family in the future, it's only natural because that's where he belongs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She doesn't believe that if Mason returns to the Reed family, the bond between her and him will disappear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you talking about?" Rosalind's voice suddenly rose. "How could you let him go back to the Reed family? If he goes back to the Reed family, will they still treat our family so well?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why can't he go back to his own home? Are you trying to keep him in the Barlow family forever, Auntie Rosalind?" Veronica sneered at Rosalind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Rosalind has been trying to please and flatter her stepdaughter for years, she became displeased and angry when she saw the expression on her stepdaughter's face at this moment. "Of course we have to keep him in the Barlow family, the longer the better! Have you ever thought about it? Without him, could you live the way you do now and live in this house?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason won't stay with the Barlow family forever. He'll have his own life, just like Auntie Rosalind said. He's the second son of the Reed family, so naturally, he'll return to where he belongs in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason will have a wider horizon, not being trapped here as a tool to be used due to her relationship with the Barlow family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You..." Rosalind suddenly exclaimed in anger, "Are you trying to make me angry to death?!"</p></div>
