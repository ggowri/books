        <h1>Chapter 528</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded and fell silent. She had thought that behind a woman with a child were only a few problems. She had never thought that the matter was so complicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A woman who had been thrown into prison by the father of her own child. How many people could withstand such a blow?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It had not been easy for Kyla to open a small restaurant and, at the same time, raise Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? Are you feeling sorry for Kyla?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yep, I think life has been very hard on Kyla," muttered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared at Grace&rsquo;s worried expression. Was she worried about Kyla?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She used to worry about her grandmother and Lina. However, it now seemed as if she had more people to worry about. A bitter and sour feeling once again spread throughout Jason&rsquo;s body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew that her worries were unrelated to romantic love. However, Jason could not help but be jealous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He probably cared too much about her feelings and did not want to share them with too many people. Jason covetously wanted her to invest more and more of her feelings in him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you get upset for me in the future, Sis?" Jason asked out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but laugh. "Why do you ask that all of a sudden?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason&rsquo;s eyes glistened. "I just want to know. Will you? Or won&rsquo;t you?" He was insistent on receiving an answer from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course I'd be sad if something happened to you. Do you even have to ask? Therefore, I hope nothing ever happens to you and that you're always safe and sound, " said Grace. Before Grace knew it, she was already afraid to imagine what would happen if something happened to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed like the more you loved someone, the more you worried about their safety and the timider you became.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, a smile appeared on the corners of Jason&rsquo;s mouth. On top of that, he took her hand, lowered his head, and scattered kisses on her palm. "Then, as you wish, I'll be all right."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason&rsquo;s beautiful, black eyes stared at Grace in a fixated way that made the latter&rsquo;s heart beat violently. Furthermore, her mind seemed to wallow in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you love me? Grace..." Jason muttered. His soft words were like the deepest temptation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had called her Grace instead of Sis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's eyes carefully looked at the face close at hand. Jason had picturesque eyes and brows, all of them were so delicate. Such men seemed to be born to be looked up to as if never to be touched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, at this moment, such a man was so close to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I love you," said Grace. Yes. At the very beginning of their relationship, Grace had not been able to articulate her love. However, she could now feel that she loved him and that feeling was slowly getting deeper and deeper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had thought that after Sean's betrayal, she would no longer be able to love anyone that deeply. However, it turned out she was wrong, and she could still love someone seriously.</p></div>
