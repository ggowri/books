        <h1>Chapter 2322</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla is now in L City, so Martin Weiss..." Grace became worried. "I gotta talk to Kyla about this. It might be pointless for her to keep on asking Martin Weiss regarding the matter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Grace took out her phone and hurriedly called Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after she told Kyla about this, Kyla was unusually quiet. "I already know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? You already knew? Then Martin Weiss..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He has no feelings for me now. I'm just a familiar stranger to him, and everything we previously experienced together is like a movie to him. Once the movie is over, then that's it," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated slightly before saying, "Kyla, in that case, why don't you return to Emerald City first? We'll come up with another solution, okay? You probably won't make the slightest progress even if you stay there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to stay a little longer. Perhaps things will turn out alright. After all, there's nothing I can do even if I return to Emerald City," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Grace could only say, "Alright, but be careful and come back to Emerald City as soon as possible. I can come over if you need me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine by myself for now. I'll come back if there really isn't any progress," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace ended the call, Jason said, "What's the matter? Kyla doesn't want to return to Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, she's going to stay there, but I'm afraid Martin Weiss might hurt Kyla since he doesn't have feelings for her now," she said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if he was hypnotized into forgetting their relationship, hypnosis... is just hypnosis, after all. Some feelings still exist even if you're hypnotized. Martin Weiss won&rsquo;t really hurt Kyla. Don't worry," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Can I not worry?' wondered Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could only hope everything would work out like what Jay said!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">... </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla put away her phone, raised her hand, and caressed her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face seemed to still have the warmth from Martin Weiss's touch earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The phone call from Grace seemed to prove Martin Weiss&rsquo;s words earlier. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that he had given up on their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then again... It was only natural for him to give up on the relationship if all it brought him was neverending pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she thought he would gradually forget it with time. She never thought he would use hypnosis to forget about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man... who used to love her so much did not even feel a thing even after she kissed him... Disappointment came over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, besides disappointment, there was an indescribable pain spreading within her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It must be because she... was still in love with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She still had feelings for him, and they were... deepening. However, his feelings for her were already gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next night, when Martin Weiss walked out of a high-end club in tMason Swansonty after ending his business meeting, Kyla stopped him. "Can we... talk?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glanced at her. "I thought we made it clear yesterday."</p></div>
