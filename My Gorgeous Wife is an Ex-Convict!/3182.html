        <h1>Chapter 3180</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Godmother can tell that Brian treats you well and is a responsible and good man. Valda, you can rest assured that you have found someone who treats you well, and Godmother is happy for you," said Lisa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He is very good to me, godmother. You can rest assured that Brian will always be good to me in the future," Valda said. After experiencing so much, she has seen this man's heart clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the next few days, Valda spent most of her time accompanying Lisa. They went to a large hospital for a comprehensive physical examination and also went shopping together. Valda showed Lisa around the residential area and took her to visit Brian's villa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The villa was quite impressive and it did leave an impact on Lisa. However, when it came to living in the villa, Lisa declined. She felt more comfortable living in Valda's small house and preferred the freedom it offered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to Lisa, living in a villa is too big and there are many servants. She feels restricted and worries about saying the wrong thing or making a mistake that others will laugh at. Even going to the kitchen requires using stairs, which is inconvenient.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, Valda didn't mention anything about letting Lisa stay in the villa and instead tried to spend more time with her in the apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, this has made things difficult for Brian, who now struggles to sleep alone every night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After getting used to her company, the feeling of loneliness becomes even more apparent when there's suddenly no one to accompany you at night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In that case, how about I move in to your apartment for a while?" Brian suggested in Valda's studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think my godmother will feel uncomfortable again. She has just adapted to the caregiver living in the apartment these days," Valda said. "Besides, there are already three people living in that room - me, my godmother, and the caregiver. It's already crowded, and if you come, it will be even more crowded."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Initially, that house only had two bedrooms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"When can you come back to the villa and live with me?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um... let's wait until after we get married," she thought for a moment and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he heard it, his eyebrows almost furrowed together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, he has to continue this "single" life for almost another year?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, isn't that too long? How about you come stay with me a few days every week?" Brian suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My godmother needs me now. Besides, she just arrived and hasn't adapted to life here yet. I need to spend more time with her," Valda leaned over and kissed Brian's forehead. "Okay, be good. After we get married, I'll live with you, and I'll spend more time with my godmother before the wedding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her with a hint of jealousy. Is he now competing with his future mother-in-law for his wife's attention?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Lisa is Valda's lifesaver. Even if Lisa takes up a lot of Valda's time now, he can only endure it. "Then kiss me more," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She blinked, wondering if he was asking for a kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew he looked like he was acting spoiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? We still have a long time until we get married. You wouldn't even kiss me more?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," she blushed slightly and kissed him on the lips as he wished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He willingly opened his mouth, matching her kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her kiss and her presence made him increasingly attached...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I'm not sure how long it took, but she finally ended the kiss, gasping for breath. "Is... is that enough?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not enough, not nearly enough," he murmured, as he leaned in to kiss her this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unlike the previous gentle kiss, this time the kiss was intense and filled with strong desire. In the end, he had to use almost all of his self-control to end the kiss and hold her tightly in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, I can only wait until our wedding day. After that, you must live with me and sleep by my side every night. Do you understand?" His hoarse voice was filled with desire. "My patience has its limits. I cannot bear to wait any longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's cheeks were flushed as she pressed her face against Brian's chest. Even through their clothes, it seemed as though she could hear his heart beating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One by one, quick and strong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The warmth from his body, even through his clothes, transferred onto her body, as if telling her how much he needed her!</p></div>
