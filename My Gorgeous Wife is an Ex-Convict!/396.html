        <h1>Chapter 395</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps because of her experience, she always refused to depend on others easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once the person she was reliant on was gone, it would be like another mountain collapsing on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared at Grace. After a while, she dropped her eyes slightly. "It's fine if you want to keep working here. Just let me know when you want to change your job."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." Grace nodded. She did not turn down Jason's offer this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, if you've been waiting outside for so long, have you eaten dinner?" Grace suddenly thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not yet," answered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you just go in and eat?" exclaimed Grace. It was a small restaurant, but at least there was plenty of food that he could have ordered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not give much thought to whether it suited his appetite. After all, when Jason and she were living in the rented house, he ate even the most humble meals with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, I'll go in next time," replied Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Grace suddenly felt as if she had said something wrong. If Jason went into the restaurant, the restaurant's vibe would probably change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car arrived at Reed Residence and the two entered the house. The chef had already prepared Jason's dinner, so Grace joined him for some.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, for Grace, it was a late-night supper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Over dinner, Grace talked about the restaurant. Being a food delivery rider was really not that tiring. She would only be busy around noon and in the evening. She was relatively free for the rest of the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla is quite nice to me. She'll say yes and help me out when I need a day off or something. I'm grateful that she hired me despite my past," said Grace. Then, her face suddenly darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Thinking about your case?" Jason frowned and asked. "Do you need me to intervene?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not for now. Lina is helping me with the evidence." Grace bit her lip a little at this. "I didn't drink and drive and I didn't crash into Jennifer Atkinson's car. It was... her car that seemed to lose control and crashed into mine. Do you believe me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she said the last four words, she looked at him, a little nervous. Since when did she care whether he believed her or not?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least, she did not mind whether others believed her or not. She would let the law clear her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before that, she wanted him to believe that she was innocent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The dining room's lights fell on his face. Even those beautiful, amorous eyes of his seemed to be blended with the dim yellow light, making his eyes look misty like they are covered with a layer of chiffon. It made it hard for her to guess what he was feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyelashes quivered a little. His hand that was holding the chopsticks tightened. After a while, his lips slowly parted as he uttered what she wanted to hear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I believe you."</p></div>
