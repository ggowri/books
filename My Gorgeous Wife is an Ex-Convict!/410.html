        <h1>Chapter 409</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if she wasn&rsquo;t my girlfriend? Would she like Brian then?" Jason seemed determined to get an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How... would he know? However, since his boss was asking him, he had no choice but to answer. "I think Miss Cummins... is quite conservative about her feelings. She won't change her mind easily once she falls in love with someone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? She was Sean's girlfriend before," answered Jason with a cold voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence felt like crying, but he had no tears. He felt he was miserable as a secretary. "Miss Cummins and Sean are over now. Since Miss Cummins was betrayed by Sean, she won't have any more feelings for him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Betrayed?" Jason raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, isn't it a betrayal for Sean to break up with Miss Cummins when she was in great need of help? With Miss Cummins's character, it's only natural that she would never forgive people who betrayed her," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Jason's face instantly darkened. His thin lips were almost drawn into a straight line. If what Sean did to Grace was betrayal, what about all the things he had done to Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There seemed to be some pressure on his heart. It was so heavy that he could hardly breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason raised his hand to grab a drink from a glass of water nearby, but when he picked it up, he noticed his hand shaking very badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, it was not just his hands that were shaking. His whole body was shaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was shaking so much that he could hardly hold the glass in his hand. In a blink of an eye, the glass slipped from his hand and fell onto the table, spilling its contents all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence was startled. Suddenly, as if aware of something, his face looked a little worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked down at the water in front of him. After a moment, he suddenly said, "Get out, Terrence!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Terrence replied and hurried out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took a deep breath and leaned back heavily in his chair. His trembling hands hid his face while the corners of his mouth began to smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It changed from a chuckle to a laugh, and finally, it turned into something similar to a burst of choked laughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If... he had known that his decision would have caused her so much pain, he would never have done it. If Grace found out about what he had done before, would she consider his actions as a betrayal?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body seemed to tremble more than ever at the thought of this possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, there were only a few people who knew what had happened back then. As long as they kept their silence, she would never know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Forgive me, Grace," he muttered. There was deep anguish suppressed in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was nothing he could do to make up for what she had suffered. If... he had known he would love her so much, he would not have let her suffer the slightest injustice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace returned to Reed Residence, it was dark inside the main house. She was about to turn on the lights when suddenly someone hugged her from behind, and she was plunged into a familiar embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The familiar scent let her know who was embracing her.</p></div>
