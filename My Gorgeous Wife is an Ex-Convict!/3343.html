        <h1>Chapter 3341</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The car is waiting, and the group gets on. The car slowly drives away from the theater.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little beggar slowly moved out from behind the old beggar, and watched the departing car. His face, covered in dirt, showed a coldness that was not appropriate for his age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, Jasper couldn't fall asleep, so he made a video call to William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can't you sleep?" William asked in a video call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm." Jasper nodded. Whenever she closed her eyes, she would think of the musical she watched today, and then she would think of Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she returned, she even took the time to write notes about today's musical, including all the important points, so that she wouldn't forget anything when she had to explain it to Lawrence later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you want to talk about?" asked William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I want to hear you play the piano," said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Play the piano?" William was momentarily surprised. In fact, it had been a long time since he had played the piano for Jasper to listen to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Jasper met Lawrence, he would occasionally play for her to listen to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And since Lawrence appeared, she always happily talked about how much she loved Lawrence's piano playing. So gradually, he stopped playing the piano in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His performance pales in comparison to Lawrence's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was just saying it casually. You don't have a piano where you live, do you?" Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I do have a piano. There's a music room. If you want to listen, I can play for you," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Jasper's eyes lit up suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," William said, taking his phone and heading towards the music room in the presidential suite where he was staying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they passed through the living room, Philip looked at his son and asked, "Aren't you going to sleep?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not yet. I'll play a song for Jasper first," William said, walking into the music room and closing the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Philip watched his son disappear and couldn't help but smile. "Why did he have to fall so deeply in love? The one who gives more in a relationship always ends up getting hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But who was it that reached out to his son when he was at his lowest point? It was Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, I guess this is a case of a fledgling bird's love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once you've made up your mind, it's for life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he had found William earlier back then, maybe everything would have been different. But in this world, there is no such thing as "if"!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William is in the piano room, he has opened the piano lid and is sitting in front of the piano. He has placed his phone vertically and positioned his face towards the camera lens on the screen. "Which piece would you like to hear?" he asks.</p></div>
