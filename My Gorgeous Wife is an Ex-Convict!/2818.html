        <h1>Chapter 2816</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't... Don't... Don't die. Don't die..." she stammered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, she was pulled into a warm embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry, I didn't know you were going to have such a big reaction. I'm sorry!" A familiar voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Whose arms are these? Mom?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. I'm here. It's gonna be okay, so don't be afraid... Don't be afraid..." The voice continued ringing, and it was as though her blood that she had felt becoming frozen earlier finally began to flow again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked up in a trance, and the handsome face was reflected in her dark pupils.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the face was no longer filled with its usual indifference but worry and anxiety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's... Brian!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked blankly at him. 'Who is he worrying about? Who is he anxious about?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda? Valda!" Brian anxiously called the person in front of him. He wanted to take her to the canyon in hopes that she could move on. He did not expect her to have such a big reaction on their way there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was regretting his decision now. If he had not taken her to the canyon, she would not be reacting the way she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was as fragile as a porcelain doll already full of cracks. She shattered to pieces with just one touch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian..." Valda Theller finally mumbled as if using up her strength to do it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry, sorry. I shouldn't have brought you here..." He apologized and took her into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She buried her face in his arms as her shoulders trembled slightly. Muffled sobs came out of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is she suppressing her crying again? Her parents were afraid of her crying, so... She's trying not to cry but laugh!' The thought of what she had said at her parents' grave made his heart ache again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can cry if you want. You don't have to hold yourself back. Even if your parents... want to see you smile more, you can cry in front of me," he said. Even if her tears would make him squirm, he did not want to see her hold back her tears so hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if his voice was slowly breaking down the high barrier she had desperately built, and her tears poured out uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wa..." She cried to her heart's content this time. She vented... years of suppressed sadness, pain, and regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gently touched her head and comforted her, but this seemed different from the time at her parents&rsquo; grave. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt a damp patch on his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of her crying and hoarse screaming filled the car. She was calling out for her parents and saying how sad she was... There was nothing he could do for her except comfort her and listen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he was powerful and rich, he was helpless in front of some things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just like how he could not be with Grace no matter how much he loved her. He could not resurrect Valda's parents either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After crying for a while, Valda Theller finally calmed down. All the crying had made her a little exhausted. Even though she had stopped crying, she still could not help gasping.</p></div>
