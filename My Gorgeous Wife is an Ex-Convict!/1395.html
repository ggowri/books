        <h1>Chapter 1394</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why let Nelson hear these?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, does Daddy... hate me?" The little one's young voice rang out. His dark eyes looked at Martin Weiss and then at Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss instantly felt flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His son's eyes were no longer full of love and attachment but hurt and estrangement instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he suddenly realized what he had just said!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take... Take the child away first!" Martin Weiss ordered the subordinate who was following behind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man replied and quickly picked Nelson up. Even though the child struggled and shouted, it was useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What on earth are you going to do to Nelson?! "Kyla Corbyn said furiously, wanting to get her son back. However, Martin Weiss was clutching her arm hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson's my son. I won't hurt him, but you... You must come with me to apologize to Paisley and the Daniels family!" said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he dragged Kyla Corbyn straight to the exit of the small park. He ordered two other men to take care of the mess here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, their dispute had attracted the attention of many people around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn almost stumbled as Martin Weiss dragged her to a car parked outside the small park. She watched one of his men carry Nelson to the other side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, where on earth are you taking Nelson?! Even if I'm dead, I won't let you get away with it so easily if anything happens to Nelson!" She glared at him with hatred, abhorring her powerlessness at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car door was locked and she could not break free from his grip!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I told you, I won't hurt him. I just asked my subordinate to send Nelson back to your place, or do you want Nelson to see you apologize and learn more about your evil deeds?" Martin Weiss said grimly and told the driver to start driving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's... Send Nelson back home?' Kyla Corbyn stopped struggling and looked at Martin Weiss with a disappointed and sarcastic look. "You said you wouldn&rsquo;t hurt Nelson but what you just said in front of him has already hurt him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pressed his thin lips together uneasily. "He's just a child. He'll soon forget it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She murmured, "You have no idea how much you&rsquo;ve hurt Nelson today... I thought you were at least sincere to your own son, but... I was too naive... Too naive..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Nelson is probably nothing to Martin Weiss when compared to Paisley Daniels's child. Besides, Martin Weiss is a perfectionist. Nelson's differently-abled, so how sincere can he be to Nelson?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Should I really give Nelson to Martin Weiss? Maybe... I should never have entrusted Nelson to this man.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said crossly, "I don't need you to tell me whether I'm sincere or not to Nelson. I was the naive one. I thought you would behave after getting out of prison!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You are very naive," she said lightly, only finding this man extremely ridiculous! He was supposed to be shrewd and clever. After all, he pulled the Weiss family out of the mud and changed their lives in such a short time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Paisley Daniels was able to fool him and he believed everything Paisley Daniels said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If... what Grace said is true, I was the one who donated him my bone marrow! I gave him a second life but he sent me to prison himself!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could there be something so ironic in the world? She saved someone but put herself in trouble doing it!</p></div>
