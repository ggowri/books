        <h1>Chapter 3043</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the room, there are only two people left: Whitney and Jasmine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney took out a small bottle of liquid from her body and then a piece of cloth. She carefully sprinkled the liquid on the cloth and covered the baby's mouth and nose with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little baby seems to be feeling uncomfortable. Their eyes are closed, but their mouth opened and they made a couple of "uhh" and "ahh" sounds before going silent again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney finally put down the handkerchief in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The handkerchief contains a strong anesthetic. Once the little one is sedated, she can leave with her child later without arousing suspicion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney quickly opened a foldable backpack that she had secretly brought in, put the child inside, and then carried the backpack on her back. She walked out of the room and quickly headed towards the villa outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, he also called Phoebe, but after thinking for a moment, he hung up without saying anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This is their secret code between her and Phoebe, telling Phoebe to wait for her outside the Barlow House with the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she walked along, even though she encountered some of the Barlow family's servants, they only assumed she was Grace, a distinguished guest of the Barlow family. Even though she was carrying a large backpack, which was a bit unusual, no one approached her to ask any questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she approached the gate, the guard stationed there looked at her and asked, "Mrs. Reed, why are you out again? And what's in the bag you're carrying on your back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I'm coughing and feeling a bit uncomfortable. I think I should go to the hospital to get checked. I've packed some food and water in this bag, so I won't get hungry at the hospital. My car is already outside, so I'll leave now," Whitney said, and hurriedly ran out the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe's car is already outside, but at this moment, Whitney caught a glimpse of a car driving not far away from them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This car... She has been observing it for the past few days, so she knows it's Philip's car!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip is back!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a start, Whitney quickened her pace and ran to the side of the car. She opened the car door and swiftly got inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the car, Phoebe was sitting in the driver's seat. As soon as she saw Whitney getting in, she started the car and drove away from the Barlow family mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two cars passed each other closely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Philip parked his car outside the Barlow family mansion and rolled down the window to ask the security guard at the gate, "Was that Mrs. Reed who just left a moment ago?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," the security guard replied, "Mrs. Reed wasn't feeling well today, so she came back alone. She only stayed for a short while before leaving again with a big bag. She said she was going to see a doctor and it seemed like she had packed some food and water in the bag. It was quite heavy, but I don't understand why she would need so much food if she was just going to see a doctor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The security guard muttered, but Philip furrowed his brow, feeling like something was not quite right.</p></div>
