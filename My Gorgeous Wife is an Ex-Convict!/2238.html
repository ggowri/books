        <h1>Chapter 2236</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Mr. Lambert coldly as if he wanted to freeze Mr. Lambert to death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Everyone's going to suffer?" Martin Weiss raised his hand and punched Mr. Lambert, sending him to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The commotion attracted the attention of the departing guests and caused an uproar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert staggered to get up from the ground, but Martin Weiss soon grabbed Mr. Lambert's collar ruthlessly, almost lifting him from the ground. "I won't let you off if you do anything to Kyla. The Lambert family can forget about ever gaining a foothold in Emerald City. I&rsquo;ll keep my word!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert was beaten into a rage. He had already compromised so much, yet this was what he got.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that Martin Weiss did not want to cut the Lambert family any slack, Mr. Lambert shouted, "Okay, Martin Weiss. I gave you a chance, but you didn't want it! Listen here, everyone! The woman standing next to Mr. Martin Weiss is an ex-convict. She's also pregnant out of wedlock! She's carrying Martin Weiss's baby, but Martin Weiss didn&rsquo;t even give her a title. But then again, she's an ex-convict!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not far away, Jacqueline Bowman, who was walking out of the party&rsquo;s venue with Neal Reid, also saw the scene. A faint smile flashed across the corner of her lips. Sure enough, it was just as she had expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could someone like Martin Weiss forgive Mr. Lambert easily when he had made a move against him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With Mr. Lambert's character, he would expose the fact that Martin Weiss was keeping Kyla as his lover and was an ex-convict to humiliate Martin Weiss if he did not get what he wanted. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like what was happening now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, to Jacqueline Bowman's surprise, a woman's voice suddenly rang out. "Miss Corbyn was wrongly convicted and it was a miscarriage of justice. The courts have retried the case and cleared Miss Corbyn's name. What you're saying can be regarded as slander. And you chose to say it at a time like this, which means you&rsquo;re obviously hoping the rumor will spread. Miss Corbyn may bring this to court, and you may be sentenced to up to three years in prison if convicted!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman looked at the speaker with a surprised look on her face. The speaker was Grace, the wife of Emerald City's famous Young master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was surrounded by wives of rich businessmen and socialites at today's party, but she was now standing up for Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What surprised her more was when she saw Grace walk up to Kyla and ask, "Kyla, I'll represent you if you want to go after this man through the law."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked gratefully at Grace. "Thank you, Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't mention it. You're my children's godmother!" Grace said, deliberately letting everyone around them hear that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was shocked when she heard that. 'Kyla's... the godmother of the Reed family's triplets?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's going on here? Kyla is just a store owner. She has no money or power. How could she be the triplets' godmother?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Kyla could do anything she wanted in Emerald City with that identity!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even... Even if she was wrongly convicted, she... She's still Martin Weiss's lover! She got pregnant out of wedlock and is willing to be a rich man's lover. How could the Reed family let someone like that be their children's godmother? Mrs. Reed, don't... Don't let this woman fool you!"</p></div>
