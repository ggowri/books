        <h1>Chapter 3096</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gazed at her steadily and asked, "Are you really sure you don't want it?" In his phoenix-like eyes, there was a captivating charm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No...don't," she struggled to keep her composure and said, trying not to fall into his charming gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People who are usually calm and composed, when provoked, their impact is multiplied and becomes much more powerful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A hint of disappointment flickered in his eyes, but he quickly smiled again. "Alright, if you don't want to, then we won't. I won't force you to do anything you don't want to do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He straightened up as he spoke, "You rest for a bit, I'll go wash my face."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After he finished speaking, he walked towards the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda sat up straight until Brian walked into the bathroom, then she breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She almost ended up like last night just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He always easily leads her astray, but fortunately the sky will darken soon and he will leave and go back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was thinking to herself when Brian emerged from the bathroom. His face was wet and his hair was soaked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was surprised and wondered if he had washed his face and hair together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you use a towel to dry yourself? Your hair is wet and water is dripping onto your clothes," Valda said as she quickly went into the bathroom and grabbed a dry towel for Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Valda could say anything, Brian obediently bent down and brought his head close to Valda's, indicating that he wanted her to help him dry off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was speechless but didn't say anything. She began to wipe the water droplets and wet hair off his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After wiping for a while, it was finally done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she took off the towel and saw the man in front of her with messy hair, she couldn't help but reach out and gently tidy it up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, do you still care about me?" he suddenly grabbed her hand and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I...I'm just drying your hair, it doesn't mean anything," she blushed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about last night? What did that mean? You said I was drunk, but you weren't, right?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face immediately turned redder and she couldn't refute a single word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, whenever you want me, just let me know," he murmured softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Boom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face seemed like it was about to explode, did he know that his words were like seduction? If she didn't have enough self-control, she might...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... it's about time. Why don't you go back first? I want to rest," she hastily made an excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go back? Where do I go?" he asked. "Wherever you are, I'll be there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was dumbfounded. Did he mean to stay here? "You want to stay here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he said. "Since you don't want to stay at my place, I'll stay at yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I only have one room, where will you sleep?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gaze fell on the big bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly added, "I...I want to sleep alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can sleep on the living room sofa," he said. "But I must stay with you, otherwise, how will I know if you will keep your promise?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She suddenly felt a sense of powerlessness. Why did she feel like she was being stuck to him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Given his personality, he doesn't seem like he should be like this!</p></div>
