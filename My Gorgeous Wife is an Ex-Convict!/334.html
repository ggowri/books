        <h1>Chapter 333</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The one who answered was of course Andrea. Andrea seemed to deliberately raise her voice. She talked about how Grace went to jail because she killed someone with her car while drunk driving...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled softly. Was Andrea stepping on her toes to make up for the frustrations of being suppressed by her in those years? Sure enough, you might not be able to see through people when you were well-regarded. However, once you were destitute, you would certainly see through them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Grace stepped out of the firm and reached the lift, there was a sudden rush of footsteps behind her. A voice rang out, "Grace, wait!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head and saw a man hurrying over before stopping in front of her. He was looking at her with an obscure look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was a moderately good-looking man in his 30s. He was of medium build and dressed in a suit as the city's elites usually did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes?" Grace asked as she looked at her old colleague. He used to partner with her at the firm. For a while, there was a rumor going around that he had a crush on her, but she was already dating Sean and such rumors did not concern her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Little by little, the gossip died down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He Zhanghuai looked at the face in front of him. Although it was the same face, her temperament had completely changed. Her passion and radiance had turned into forbearance and destitution. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even the light in her eyes seemed to be repressed by something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&hellip; can turn to me if you have any trouble. I'll help you if I can," He Zhanghuai said sincerely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Grace only found it funny. Back then, no one in the law firm dared to take her case. Lina had visited the firm several times for her case only to be disappointed each time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't suppose I have anything to ask of you now," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He Zhanghuai hurriedly said, "You can't be a delivery girl for long. Why don't I ask my friend to recommend a better job that pays well, and you don't even have to be battered by the wind and rain?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want to help me find a job?" Grace smiled a little. "Have you forgotten who's the victim in my case? It was Jennifer Atkinson, Jason's fianc&eacute;e. Aren't you afraid?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He Zhanghuai seemed to look a little awkward. "Grace, I'm sorry I didn't help with your case. I've been regretting it for years, and now that you're out of prison, I just want to help you in any way I can."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to say you're sorry for not helping me. People will always seek the good and avoid the bad. Helping me would be doing me a favor. There's nothing to blame if you didn't help. However, now that I've got through it, there's no need for you to help me anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace finished, the elevator came up to their floor. The doors opened, and she walked into it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He Zhanghuai looked at the elevator door in desolation as it closed slowly. His hands that were at his side slowly clenched into fists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, he actually had a momentary impulse to take over her case and help her!</p></div>
