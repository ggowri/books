        <h1>Chapter 3540</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even now, she often wonders if things would have been different if she hadn't insisted on finding Lawrence all those years ago. Maybe Lawrence's mother wouldn't have succumbed to addiction, and Lawrence's parents would still be alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though they lived in poverty, they were still alive, unlike now where they are separated by heaven and earth, and even Lawrence has disappeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Almost instinctively, Jasper walked towards the piano room the girls had mentioned. Several girls were already crowded around the door, peering inside through the glass and exclaiming in amazement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Jasper approached the door, he could faintly hear the sound of piano music coming from inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the room was soundproofed, the door was not, so if someone stood at the door, they could hear the piano music inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was... Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This piece of music, she was more familiar with it than anything else. Even after Lawrence disappeared, she played it countless times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, several people were crowded in front of the glass door, and Jasper couldn't see inside, couldn't see what the person playing inside looked like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She just stood a little further away from the door, closed her eyes, and listened quietly to the faint sound of the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she is a skilled pianist herself, she is amazed by the level of proficiency displayed by the other person's piano performance. Such a level of piano playing is sufficient to join a good symphony orchestra!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, she doesn't know why, but this kind of performance gives her an inexplicable feeling of familiarity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, a certain guess flashes through her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when this guess arises, her emotions also fluctuate, like a calm sea suddenly encountering a strong wind, causing a wave of turmoil!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could it be Lawrence playing the piano?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The technique of playing is much better than Lawrence's performance of Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige before, but there is still a hint of Lawrence's style in the interpretation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, if it really is Lawrence, he should know that she has entered this school. After all, she is the representative of the new students in this year, and so many people in the school are talking about her. He has no reason not to know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Lawrence knows that they are in the same school, then why doesn't he appear in front of her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Too many speculations pass through her mind one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, the sound of the piano ends, and the discussion among those girls becomes even more enthusiastic. Jasper and Grace keep their eyes closed, savoring the aftertaste of the music until the sound of the door opening finally prompts her to slowly open her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A figure walked out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a tall and slender boy, with fair skin and a pair of beautiful but melancholic eyes, like the autumn sky, desolate yet charming. His straight nose was set against his sharply defined thin lips. Such a boy was undoubtedly attractive to women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Jasper's gaze was fixed on him not because of his beauty, but because of his face...it was familiar, with a shadow of Lawrence, like...an adult Lawrence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is it Lawrence? Is it really Lawrence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He's still alive! He appeared in front of her like this!</p></div>
