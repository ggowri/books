        <h1>Chapter 850</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina then told him about Chase Harper. When she was done, she said in a gossipy manner, "I think Chase Harper must like Grace. Otherwise, he wouldn't drive Grace back every time Grace goes to talk to him about the case. I've checked. He lives in the opposite direction from Grace's place."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin let out a sigh of relief. 'It turns out that this girl is not having a crush on another man after all.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she told him she liked him and that she wanted to be in a relationship with him, he was still a little skeptical. After all, she had a long history of being infatuated with several men!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if he really likes Grace, it's still up to her. I think she&rsquo;s not in the mood for another relationship anytime soon," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina immediately looked discouraged like a deflated balloon. "Yeah, I blame Jason for hurting Grace so deeply. I should&rsquo;ve advised Grace not to date Jason back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina wanted to slap herself when she recalled that she approved of their relationship!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Take it easy. If they&rsquo;re destined and if Chase Harper really likes Grace, perhaps she&rsquo;d be willing to open up to Chase Harper after a few years?" said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina hesitated a little. "Isn't a few years... too long?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace will be over 30 in a few years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A woman's youth is limited!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it?" Hadwin smiled softly. "If you really like a person, what are a few years? Even if you have to wait 10 or 20 years or even longer, you'll wait anyway. If you're unwilling to wait, then there's a limit to your love."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina stared at the man in front of her. He just said those words so carefreely as if the years he spoke of were as light as feathers and were not at all a heavy burden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you wait for me too?" She could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina realized it seemed a bit inappropriate after asking the question. They were already in a real relationship, so there was no need for him to wait!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." Hadwin gave her a definite answer. "If you haven't come to understand love and have yet to fall in love with me, then I'll wait for you, no matter how long."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's heart rate suddenly quickened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this a form of... sweet talk? I... like it very much.' She felt a gush of sweetness pouring out of her heart, and she knew he was telling the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if he was talking about it lightly, but his eyes told her that he would wait for her until she understood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately... she got the meaning. She really liked him and had fallen in love with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin, what should I do? I think I'll love you more and more," grumbled Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was a little stunned, then he said, "If you take out the words 'I think,' I'll like what you just said better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina giggled and suddenly thought of a question. "Then again, when did you fall in love with me? I don't think we spent much time together three years ago. It can&rsquo;t be because I was too good that night and made you unable to forget me, right? Then it would mean that you fell in love with my body before falling for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina started letting her imagination run wild again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin almost choked on his saliva. 'What the hell is this girl thinking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She wasn't any good at all that night. She was like a combination of a playboy and a bully... However, I didn't resist&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the thought of that night, Hadwin&rsquo;s face started to flush even though he was usually always calm and calculating.</p></div>
