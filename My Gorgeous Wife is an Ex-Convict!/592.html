        <h1>Chapter 591</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, Andrea Schwartz had deliberately ordered several times ever since learning she was delivering food here. How could Grace not know what Andrea Schwartz was thinking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Is there something wrong with the order?" asked Kyla from the cashier counter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing." Grace chuckled. Then, she picked up the order, walked over to her electric bike, and rode off toward the law firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace went into the firm carrying Andrea Schwartz&rsquo;s food, Andrea Schwartz came forward and said with a smile, "Hey, Grace. Thank you so much for delivering my order again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't mention it. It's my job," Grace said lightly and held her order out to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of taking it, Andrea Schwartz suddenly took her to the general room and said to all her colleagues there, "Here, everyone. This is the person involved in the case I just told you about. She's also our former colleague, Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, all eyes were on Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A bad feeling suddenly rose in Grace's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz said with a sincere expression, "I'm in charge of teaching some of the rookies here these days, and as you know, the best thing to do is mention some of the controversial cases in the past and discuss it. I happened to tell them about your case today, but instead of looking at the court records and case description, it&rsquo;ll be better to just listen to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Andrea Schwartz spoke, she lovingly took Grace's hand and said, "Grace, you're not going to say no, are you? You kept saying that you were wronged at the trial. Why don't you tell us about it? Maybe all of us can brainstorm and help you find some clues that can help you reverse your case?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found that her hands and feet were cold. Each sentence and every word Andrea Schwartz said seemed to be drawing a bloody gash in her old wound!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brainstorm? Clues? Reverse her case?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was ridiculous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the accident happened and when she needed help, Andrea Schwartz never once offered to help her! She even avoided her, afraid that she would trouble her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, saying such words now was like cutting her bloody wounds open for irrelevant people to see.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Andrea Schwartz coldly. She only thought Andrea Schwartz was a little bit despicable, wanting to step on her no matter what. However, now she realized Andrea Schwartz was more despicable than she thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's cold eyes made Andrea Schwartz feel a sudden tingling in her heart, but she repressed the anxiety in her heart and said with a smile, "What's the matter with you, Grace? Why are you looking at me like this? I just want to help you. After all, we were colleagues. If you were wronged, I also hope that the law can clear your name and give you justice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're really despicable, Andrea Schwartz!" Grace said relentlessly, pulling her hand straight out of hers. "If you really want to help me, why didn't you help me three years ago? Why didn't you take my case when I couldn't even find a lawyer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I was..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Afraid of being implicated by my case? So why aren't you afraid of getting implicated now? Aren't you even afraid that these rookies will get implicated by discussing my case?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just trying to help you, Grace. Now you're going too far!" Andrea Schwartz said, exasperated.</p></div>
