        <h1>Chapter 500</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina sneaked a glance at Hadwin. &lsquo;Hmm, he looks good in a suit. He looks rather handsome! He is indeed very good-looking! No wonder I was so rash to do such a thing to him when I got drunk back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;On that note, he does have a good physique. Although he&rsquo;s a little on the skinny side, he&rsquo;s muscularly firm...&rsquo; Lina recalled the time she saw Hadwin in his full naked glory as she looked at him...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her complexion immediately flushed red, and she quickly looked down. She was telling herself to stop thinking of such nonsense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin caught sight of Lina who was at a corner with her head lowered. He was unsure of what was going through her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her figure, Hadwin&rsquo;s lips inadvertently curved into a small smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The boss said to Hadwin, &ldquo;Mr. Stephenson, we can begin.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thus, the boss started the meeting. He began by introducing Hadwin, then he introduced some of the past projects done by the firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not forget to mention Hattie Robson as well. &ldquo;This is our youngest designer. Don&rsquo;t think that her age is too young as her father is a famous designer in the industry. She has won an international award as well. Some of her designs are very creative. Later if you have the time, Chairman Stephenson, you can have a look at her designs as well.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hattie Robson quickly stood up and put her best foot forward. &ldquo;Nice to meet you, Chairman Stephenson. I&rsquo;m Hattie Robson. This is our first meeting. I hope you&rsquo;ll teach me a thing or two in the future.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Oh, I know you,&rdquo; Hadwin lazily replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hattie Robson was pleasantly surprised. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Did he say that he knows me? Has he seen my past designs and was captivated by them?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hattie Robson&rsquo;s heart began to leap erratically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina, who was hiding at a corner, finally looked up and stared at Hadwin. She inexplicably felt a bad premonition as if... something was going to happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin&rsquo;s subsequent words made Lina&rsquo;s body stiffen as her premonition came to fruition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;My girlfriend mentioned you to me once,&rdquo; Hadwin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Girlfriend?&rdquo; Hattie Robson was taken aback as a sense of disappointment rose within her heart. She did not expect that the man already had a girlfriend. It was as if she lost a chance, even though she already had a boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was then curious about who his girlfriend was. Was it someone she knew? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I heard that you and my girlfriend got into a fight till both of you ended up in the police station and that it was over your boyfriend. By the way, who is your boyfriend? I want to see what he looks like because it seems yesterday&rsquo;s scuffle happened due to you presuming that my girlfriend&rsquo;s interested in your boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Hadwin said that, everyone&rsquo;s gaze landed on Hattie Robson, Taylor Carline... and Lina who was hiding at a corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Hadwin did not mention names stating who was his girlfriend, the whole firm knew that Lina and Hattie Robson had been involved in a scuffle yesterday over Taylor Carline.</p></div>
