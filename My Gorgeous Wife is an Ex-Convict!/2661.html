        <h1>Chapter 2659</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, just do what I say. I'm driving over right now. I'll tell you more later!" Camille Strickland said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller quickly stopped the work at hand and asked her assistants to go home first. She left after turning off the computer and locking the studio door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she got to the entrance of the building, she saw security guards blocking a group of people. These people were holding cameras. Some held video cameras, while others held microphones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amidst the cacophony of voices, Valda Theller was instantly dumbfounded when she heard &lsquo;Xinyue Studio&rsquo; and her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Are these people here for me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller turned around and hurried out of the building through the side entrance. However, she heard someone calling her name from behind before she went far. Immediately, she was surrounded by a group of people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're Miss Theller Xinyue, and your birth name is Valda Theller. You're the author of Meeting You. I heard that you used to be bullied at school. Is it true?" The question made Valda Theller stiffen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I heard it was because you kept bothering a boy at school and deliberately harmed the girl who approached him. In other words, you're both the victim and the bully, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you intend to apologize to the people you&rsquo;ve bullied?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you admit to these?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cacophony of voices and various questions exploded in Valda Theller's ears. She paled, and her limbs stiffened. It felt like she had returned to school where she was surrounded and verbally abused by the people there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cameras pointed at her, and lights flashed before her eyes. She tried to hide from them but did not know how to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Camille Strickland rushed over and grabbed her best friend's shoulder to block the cameras. "Make way. Make way. We'll explain everything later. Make way..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland shouted as she pulled Valda Theller out of tMason Swansonrcle the reporters had formed. The building's security guards had also come over to help block the reporters. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland took Valda Theller to a car parked outside and quickly left the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was still in a daze. 'How did those reporters find out what had happened so many years ago?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Those reporters crave chaos. Don't go to the studio for the time being. Stay at my place first. We'll wait until this dies down in a few days," Camille Strickland said as she drove.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did the reporters suddenly mention that year's incident?" Valda Theller was confused. Besides, she was not from the entertainment industry. Even if she was the comic artist behind the adaptation, she was not famous. Normally, not many people would pay her any attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your photo with Gloria was posted online. Then, some people found out about what had happened to you at school. It somehow went viral, and this happened... I called you as soon as I saw the viral post," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was still late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled wrily, not expecting herself to go viral because of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was unknown what else was waiting for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Brian looked at the trending post on his phone and instructed his secretary, "Have someone take down all of the trending posts related to Valda Theller and find out who&rsquo;s behind this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," the secretary replied immediately. However, they thought, 'Isn't Valda Theller the comic artist of the drama adaptation that President Hart asked me to contact Gloria to star in?'</p></div>
