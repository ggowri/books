        <h1>Chapter 1657</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This melodious voice was his favorite sound. He had been dreaming about it, but now it was telling him the cruelest things!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's face instantly paled!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you sure... you don't love me anymore?" Even his voice became strained, and he spoke every word with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said, "If I still love you, I wouldn't be going on blind dates or trying to date again. I loved you wholeheartedly when we were still dating. But I want a clean breakup. I want to have nothing to do with you after breaking up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"A clean breakup?" He gave a bitter smile. She knew nothing yet told him she wanted a clean breakup. She had no idea what Katherine Jackson did after she got injured, much less what he did for her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's wrong with that?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is it because of Anthony Sherman that you don't love me anymore?" he asked. However, before she could answer, he said firmly, "You don't love him. If you did, you wouldn't have reacted the way you did when I kissed you last time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's expression changed. Her pearly white teeth bit her lip tightly. She looked like a small animal that was at a loss&mdash;pitiful and heart-rending.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he was the one who was at a loss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina, you don't love Anthony Sherman, do you?" She felt his breath on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She took a deep breath. "So what if I don't love him? Just because I don't love him doesn't mean I love you!" She threw her arms around his neck as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He instantly stiffened and grew paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at her face as it suddenly approached, he instantly knew what she was going to do. However... he could not... He could not bear to push her away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even if she did not mean it and it would hurt him, he would still accept it...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her lips rested heavily on his, just like how he had kissed her before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She re-created the kiss, doing so mechanically that it felt rather frigid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he could not help closing his eyes to savor it, fantasize, and think that they were alright and she still loved him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the kiss ended, Lina looked at Hadwin Stephenson quietly. "What does such a kiss represent, then? It means you can kiss someone you don't love like that as well. I can kiss Anthony Sherman in front of you to prove it, but... I don't want to kiss him like that just to prove something to you. Because that would be insulting to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, this was the only way she could prove it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson, I can't agree with your attitude toward love and I can't keep up with you. I can't even help you in your career, so why pester me? We&rsquo;ve both hurt each other, so we&rsquo;re even now.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His face grew paler, and he trembled slightly as a thin layer of sweat broke out on his forehead. "It can never be even. Lina, it can never be even between us!"</p></div>
