        <h1>Chapter 3742</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to feel guilty because he was the one who betrayed their relationship first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But... after all these years, Veronica was going to be with Mason?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, Veronica claimed that she only had a brotherly affection for Mason! So, what's going on now?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If Veronica had started dating Mason from the beginning, he probably wouldn't have dated her, and maybe he wouldn't have ended up in his current situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was like a stumbling block in the emotional world of Veronica and Mason, used and then discarded!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why? Why should he become a stumbling block in someone else's relationship? Why is he the only one suffering among the three?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He is not willing to accept it, how could he be willing to accept it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So now, he wants revenge! Even if Veronica and Mason are together, he will make them uncomfortable, especially Mason. He won't let him off easy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Veronica was about to finish work, Daniel walked over to her and said, "Veronica, there are still some things I don't understand. Can you teach me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ah, sure." Veronica looked at the time and replied. She had an appointment to have dinner with Mason in an hour. To avoid any misunderstandings at the company, she specifically told Mason not to send a driver to pick her up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there are some reporters who usually stake out the company's stars for photos. She was afraid that if a luxury car came to pick her up and was mistakenly photographed by those reporters, it would inevitably cause a stir.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she is not afraid of rumors, the company is not like school. If things go wrong, it will directly become hot gossip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Half an hour should be enough. Veronica thought to herself that she would arrive at </span><span>the dinner location in half an hour.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she came to Daniel's new desk and began to explain everything that Daniel didn't understand. But every time she thought she had explained enough, Daniel would come up with a bunch of new questions. By the time they finished, it was almost time for dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh my god, she's going to be late! Veronica secretly exclaimed in her heart. Even if she took a taxi to rush over there, she wouldn't make it in time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you, you've spent so much time on me." Daniel said politely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to be polite." She hurriedly packed up her things and returned to her desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she was about to leave, Daniel stopped her and said, "It's getting late. Why don't we have dinner together? You can also tell me more about the company since I just arrived today."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I already made plans with someone else," Veronica refused. "I'll tell you about the company tomorrow when we're at work."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Made plans with someone else? Is it Mason?" Daniel asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's face blushed slightly as she replied, "Yes, it is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really dating him?" Daniel asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica hesitated for a moment before nodding her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you really like him or are you being forced?" Daniel stared at Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was taken aback for a moment before saying, "There's no force. It's voluntary, even... it's what I hoped for!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hoped for?" Daniel frowned. "Do you love Mason?"</span></p></div>
