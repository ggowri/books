        <h1>Chapter 1150</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager was afraid that someone would be killed, so he immediately called Patrick. After all, Patrick's family was the boss behind Tianxiang Pavilion, and Patrick was friends with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As such, Patrick could only take Grace with him to put out the fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, in Patrick's opinion, Jason's abnormality these days probably had something to do with Grace. In particular, Jason's attitude toward women who were obviously trying to seduce him was different these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was vicious and temperamental. It did not matter what those women did in front of him, but once some small details annoyed him, they would come to a miserable end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If this went on, Patrick figured that it would not be long before his Tianxiang Pavilion would be completely void of women!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately said, "Stop the car! I'll call the police if you don't!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fine, call the police. If using your phone isn't enough, you can use mine to call the police a few more times!" said Patrick as he flung his phone to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent, knowing that Patrick was determined to take her somewhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Patrick's car stopped, Grace found that it was Tianxiang Pavilion. It was a famous place in Emerald City. Many of Emerald City's rich people patronized this place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there were supposed to be many fancy cars parked outside Tianxiang Pavilion, but there were not many cars parked here today. It seemed a bit deserted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where is he?" Patrick hurriedly asked the manager who came over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's inside, but no one dares to stop Master Reed. Master Reed is too..." The manager's face was a little pale, and he was trembling. Master Reed was just like death. No one dared to stop him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shuddered. 'Is the Master Reed he mentioned Jason?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, Patrick pulled her by the arm and took her into Tianxiang Pavilion. "Come on. Meet Jason with me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you bring me here to see Jason? We&rsquo;ve broken up. We have nothing to do with each other anymore!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Patrick said, "Since you have nothing to do with Brian, you'd better say it in front of Jason again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick had a hunch that Jason's outburst tonight might be related to the video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, though Jason's behavior had been unpredictable and terrifying since a few days ago, it certainly never led to anything fatal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, another Tianxiang Pavilion waiter rushed over. As soon as he saw Patrick, he said with a sullen expression, "Oh no, Young Master Ye, it seems that Master Reed really won&rsquo;t let Mr. Lee go. What if Master Reed kills him here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, Patrick panicked and immediately dragged Grace toward where Jason was at. Grace could not refuse at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A lot of waiters were standing at the doorway of the largest private room on the second floor. When they saw Patrick, they immediately moved out of the way as if they had seen a savior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Customers had already been asked to leave the place, so the people standing and looking from outside the private room were all employees.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick dragged Grace into the private room.</p></div>
