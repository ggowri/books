        <h1>Chapter 3562</h1>
        <div><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">If he really is Lawrence, then what does his dream of saying &quot;don&#x27;t hit me&quot; mean?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Jasper suddenly felt a sharp pain in his heart.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;You&#x27;d better put away that sympathetic look of yours,&quot; Roger&#x27;s mocking voice sounded, &quot;I don&#x27;t need your sympathy, Miss Reed.&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;I...I&#x27;m not sympathetic,&quot; she bit her lip and said.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">He didn&#x27;t argue with her, just asked, &quot;You said you came to find me, is there something you want to ask me?&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Only then did she remember the purpose of her visit, &quot;I came to ask you why you publicly asked me if I wanted to date you yesterday.&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Do we need to ask about this?&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;Of course, it&#x27;s because I want to date you that I said that.&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;You want to date me?&quot; Jasper looked skeptical. &quot;But you don&#x27;t like me, do you?&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Sometimes, he even looked at her with a hint of disgust in his eyes.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;How can you be so sure that I don&#x27;t like you?&quot; He suddenly approached her, one hand firmly around her waist and the other hand holding the back of her head, making it almost impossible for her to move.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">As he leaned in, his handsome face was close to hers. &quot;If I said that I like you, would you want to date me?&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">She was stunned. Apart from William, it was the first time she had been so close to a man who was not related to her by blood. His breath sprayed on her face, hot and itchy, and she could easily see her own face reflected in his pupils.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">His pupils were very black, like black glass, with clear black and white eyes, giving people a sense of purity. His straight nose made his delicate face more three-dimensional, with a full forehead, soft cheek lines, and those sexy thin lips. His facial features and contours had a shadow of Lawrence.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">If Lawrence saw her again, would his eyes be filled with the same disgust as before?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;But you hate me, don&#x27;t you?&quot; she murmured.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">His eyes flickered slightly, then he sneered and lifted his thin lips, &quot;Even if I hate you, we can still date. You are the princess of the Reed family. If I date you, I can save decades of struggle. Who wouldn&#x27;t want that?&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">She was stunned. Although she understood the logic behind it, that some of the guys who had shown interest in her before were attracted to the Reed family behind her, he was the first person to say it so bluntly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;What, are you not naive enough to not understand this logic?&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">She looked at him steadily and suddenly reached out her hand, touching his cheek.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">The mocking smile on his lips froze, and even his whole body became stiff.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">His black eyes narrowed, looking at her suspiciously, &quot;You--&quot;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Her hand continued to stroke his cheek, fingertips brushing over his eyebrows, eyes, and nose...</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Time seemed to slow down to a crawl.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">He knew he should let go of her, remove her hand from his face, and not let this continue.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">If he kept going like this, he would be like he was when he was a child, easily swayed by her.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">But his body remained stiff, and he still held onto Jasper with both hands.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">It&#x27;s like an instinctual feeling, not wanting to let go of her.</span></p></div>
