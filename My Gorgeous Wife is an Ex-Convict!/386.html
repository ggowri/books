        <h1>Chapter 385</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would look at him and fall in a trance for a moment as if they were incomparably close. However, the next moment, her eyes seemed to return to their usual way of desperately trying to get away from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What was different from the past was that it now seemed to be a struggle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For a moment, she did not know how to answer him. Her face turned redder and redder under his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why won't you look at me? I want you to look at me, Sis!" He leaned close to her as he spoke. It was as if she had been mesmerized by his voice as her eyes fell unconsciously on his face. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This man was looking at her tenderly right now, and there seemed to be longing and attachment in that look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His bangs were pulled back, revealing his full forehead. In her mind, he was constantly overlapping with Jay in her memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jay used to look at her like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you like me in any way?" His voice once again murmured in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A flash of guilt crossed her face, and she opened her mouth to deny it. However, her words seemed stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Did... she like him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace asked herself. If he was just Jay, then maybe she would like him. Maybe he would be more than just a brother. However, he was Jason...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You like me." There was a note of certainty in his voice as it floated into her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was as if her expression had given him the answer he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A smile rose from the corners of his lips, and it was all over his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">All she was thinking at that moment was that his smile was so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Back at Reed Residence, Grace was following Jason into the living room when she suddenly asked, "Well... You helped me so much today. How... How do you expect me to repay you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, no pain, no gain. It was only normal that he wanted her to repay him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He paused before turning to her. He asked, "How are you going to repay me? Stay with me forever or sleep with me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She bit her lip and took a deep breath. Just as she was about to say yes, his fingers were already on her lips. "Don't you remember that when you asked me for 50 million dollars, I already said I don't want it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was baffled and looked at him in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I may have you, but it's not nearly enough for me, you know? That's not all I want," he said, his elegant voice drifting around the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">'What does he really want, then?' she asked herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I want you to like me. Not just a little bit, but a lot." He slowly bent down and breathed onto her face. "I want you to like me so much that you can't bear losing me, Sis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her heart began to tremble, beating so fast that even her blood flow seemed to be speeding up because of his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He brushed his fingers lightly over her face. "Yes, I could have you promise to stay with me forever, or I could just have my way with you, but what's the point if you don't want it?"</p></div>
