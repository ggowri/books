        <h1>Chapter 1756</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She got up from her chair with a start.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Wha&rsquo;s wrong?" asked Jason as he hurried to Grace's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's Lily!" said Grace as she pointed at the woman on the screen who was seen approaching Sean. She recognized Lily at a glance even though the video quality was not very clear and Lily had changed a lot in the past five years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, Lily was her biggest nightmare&mdash;a horrible nightmare!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason narrowed his eyes and watched the surveillance footage with Grace, who paused the scene when Lily beckoned a child over to Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She remembered... this child. It was the little boy who played the piano really well at the exhibition that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is the child related to Lily? Could the child be... Lily's?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily had brought the child to meet Sean. In other words, could the child... be Sean's?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This speculation ran through Grace's head. It was not long before someone found surveillance footage of Lily and Sean's second meeting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason then had someone find where Lily was staying through the surveillance footage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sure enough, it was much easier to track down Lily in this way. However, they discovered that Lily had been staying in a cheap hotel and she checked out right before Mason was kidnapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Further checking surprisingly revealed where Lily had been hiding all these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had been in Lu City! She also had a son, William, who was now five years old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, William did not attend kindergarten. There happened to be a retired piano teacher in the urban village of Lu City where Lily lived. William had taken piano lessons from the man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, the kidnappers sent an email to Terrence from abroad. It was obvious they had made preparations for counter-reconnaissance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not difficult to find the actual source of the email, but it would take a while. Besides, even if they did locate it, it might just lead them to an internet cafe or a shopping mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The contents of the email made Jason frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The email required them to deposit the 100 million dollars into an overseas account. They also wanted Grace to pick up the child at a designated location after that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said right away, "No way! It's too dangerous for you to pick him up alone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Regardless if it's dangerous or not, we have to try!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pondered and replied by email, saying that the money would only be deposited to their account after they made sure the child was safe. They would transfer the money when they saw Mason at the designated location and retrieved him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said in the email that he would pick up the child personally and would not bring any of his men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, you won't let me go alone but you want to go alone?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It&rsquo;s better that I go. Besides, I'm Mason's father. Isn't it only natural that I should go?" said Jason as he sent the email. Grace could not even talk him out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The kidnappers soon emailed back, saying they could make payment when retrieving the child. However, Grace had to be the one who paid them and picked up the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Their email sounded as if this would end in mutual destruction if they disagreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They also informed them that they would send the email with the location right before the deal took place! If Grace did not arrive at the specified location within the timeframe, they would kill the child.</p></div>
