        <h1>Chapter 2260</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of this, Neal Reid rushed forward again and slapped Jacqueline Bowman several times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman's face was soon beaten swollen. "Neal, listen to me. I... I went to see Martin Weiss for the sake of your business. I really did it for you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I can't see through you? Jacqueline Bowman, don't you know what kind of woman you are? You're lucky that I was willing to make your life as comfortable as it is now. Otherwise, do you think an ex-convict like you can enjoy such a comfortable life? Since you want to be with Martin Weiss more, you can go to him. It seems my place isn&rsquo;t good enough for you! Hence, I'm taking this house back. I'll give you three days to leave!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid was about to walk away after saying that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman was taken aback. Ignoring the pain, she hurriedly tried to grab Neal Reid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would have nothing left if she got evicted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Neal, don't kick me out. I've been with you for so many years. I really did it for you. I won't go look for Martin Weiss again. As for the business deal you mentioned, I... I'll go look for Kyla again. I'll find a way to get her to help you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, Neal Reid kicked Jacqueline Bowman to the floor before she could finish. Jacqueline Bowman instantly felt a sharp pain in her stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ouch... Neal, my stomach hurts..." she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Neal Reid ignored her and walked away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman could only endure the pain and dialed 120 herself. When she lay in the hospital bed and heard what the doctor told her after her examination, her face turned ghastly pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She... had a miscarriage!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not even know that she was pregnant! She kept thinking she could change her fate after getting pregnant with Neal Reid's baby, but the baby she worked so hard to conceive was now gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Furthermore, what was crueler was that she learned from the doctor that her body had difficulties conceiving right from the start. The miscarriage this time had dealt a severe blow to her body that the chances of her getting pregnant again in the future were slim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman felt a pang of despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she could not have children, things would not end well for her even if she tried her best to get back together with Neal Reid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sooner or later, Neal Reid would still get rid of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why? Why is this happening to me? This is all Kyla's fault!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Kyla had been willing to help her out a little, Neal would not have done this to her, nor would she have lost her baby. She could have used the baby in her belly to become the official Mrs. Wu!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman's hatred grew as she thought of it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla could become Mrs. Weiss, conceive Martin Weiss's child, and live a happy life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why should I be so miserable? Even Neal Reid has abandoned me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hatred flashed across Jacqueline Bowman's eyes as her fingers wrapped tightly around her phone. She was busy thinking of something!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Three days later, Jacqueline Bowman came to Kyla's store again. Kyla froze when she saw the state Jacqueline Bowman was in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman's face was pale, and the bruises on her face had not subsided. She looked gaunt.</p></div>
