        <h1>Chapter 3575</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the two of them were completely unaware of this scene, but it was all seen by another person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger looked at the two people who were behaving intimately not far away, and his hand hanging by his side slowly tightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he felt a strange feeling surging in his heart. He felt that the scene in front of him was so dazzling that it made him uncomfortable all over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you looking at?" A voice sounded beside him, and Roger turned his head to see his classmate Jeffrey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing." He shrugged indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Jeffrey also noticed Jasper and William not far away and said, "Looking at those two? They truly live up to their reputation as the prince and princess of the school."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Prince and princess?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, indeed. One is the heir of the Barlow family of Deer Capital, and the other is the grand princess of the Reed family. They are a good match in terms of family background and appearance. Moreover, it is said that they have been childhood sweethearts." Jeffrey continued, and then seemed to suddenly remember something and said, "By the way, I heard that you previously asked Jasper out. Is that true? Do you also have feelings for this grand princess of the Reed family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger rolled his eyes and said, "You're overthinking it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's good then," Jeffrey said, "I just don't want you to end up falling completely for the grand princess and getting hurt in the end!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Roger stared at Jeffrey with a smile that was not quite a smile. "How do you know it will be me who suffers pain and injury? Maybe it will be someone else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Jeffrey was momentarily stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger, however, had already lifted his foot and walked forward on his own. The hand hanging at his side, though, was clenched tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Emerald City Charity has always attracted many celebrities and stars, especially those who are currently popular. Participating in the charity is considered an honor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Jason, Grace, and Jasper arrived at the scene, they naturally became the focus of attention, especially Jasper today. She was wearing a delicate light pink dress and matching headpiece, looking like a fallen princess from the mortal world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the scene, many men's eyes were also directed towards Jasper. After all, everyone understood that if they could win the favor of the Reed family's princess, they would be able to have a prominent position in Emerald City in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, even though many men had such thoughts in their minds, no one really took the initiative to approach and talk to Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was because in Emerald City, everyone knew that there was a childhood friend by the side of the Reed family's princess who was simply incomparable to ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William walked up to Jasper and said, "You look very beautiful tonight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You look handsome too," Jasper replied. William was wearing a black suit tonight, with his bangs parted in the middle, making him look both mature and youthful.</p></div>
