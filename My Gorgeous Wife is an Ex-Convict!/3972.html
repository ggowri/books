        <h1>Chapter 3970</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Mick standing there was even more conspicuous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, Nancy felt her heart pounding, a sense of inexplicable unease enveloping her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she approached him, the feeling of unease grew stronger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it because he was looking at her expressionlessly? Nancy wondered to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you here?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"To find you," Mick said expressionlessly. "Are you here to pay respects to your mother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," she replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you come to inform your mother because you have avenged your big grudge?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words made her suddenly startled, and her heart beat faster!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She opened her mouth, wanting to say something, but her brain seemed to be gradually blanking out, leaving her momentarily at a loss for words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy, are you satisfied with using me?" His voice was like thunder, fiercely piercing her eardrums.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What...what are you saying?" she stammered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He approached her, "Do you really not know what I'm talking about?" His icy gaze reminded her of the first time she met him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, it was even colder than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was at a loss!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He laughed in anger, "Nancy, you hate Clarissa for pushing your mother down the stairs. You want to get revenge on her and the Schultz family. But you also know that with your abilities, you can't shake the Schultz family in a short time. So when we met for the third time, you had already decided to use me, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her heart was in a panic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you still want to deny it? Or do I have to show you the evidence before you admit it?" He glared at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lower lip tightly, her body trembling slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this...the worst outcome?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had originally wanted to confess to him in person and beg for his forgiveness, but now he already knew the truth that she had used him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why was she always like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Slow step by step.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When her mother fell down the stairs, she was also a step too slow and couldn't catch her falling body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, she was also a step too slow to tell him the truth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, you're right. I...used you." Nancy slowly opened her mouth and admitted, "Because I couldn't deal with the Schultz family myself, I had to rely on you to help me put Clarissa in jail and make her pay the price she deserved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He squinted at her and asked, "So what about the car accident? Did Clarissa really hit you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Clarissa wanted to hit me, but at that time, I had the ability to avoid it. I just...didn't avoid </span><span>it..." Then, she used his feelings for her to complete her revenge!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You--" He stared at her fiercely, his chest heaving, a strange pain seemed to be spreading from his heart, "Nancy, you really dare to do this. You even let Clarissa hit you with a car just to get revenge. Aren't you afraid of death?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her eyelashes trembled slightly, "At that time, I had to take a gamble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for that car accident, if she hadn't been hit, Clarissa might still be at large today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take a gamble?" His voice suddenly changed, he grabbed her chin and forced her to look up at him, "Are you gambling on whether your life is long enough, or whether I'm stupid enough?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His sharp gaze carried a rare pain.</span></p></div>
