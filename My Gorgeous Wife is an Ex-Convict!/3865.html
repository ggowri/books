        <h1>Chapter 3863</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica woke up the next day, it was almost 9 o'clock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason was no longer in the room, and even the makeshift bed on the floor from last night had been put away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica quickly freshened up, changed her clothes, and walked out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she arrived in the living room, Jasper was having breakfast at the table, while William had already finished and was just sitting aside, not eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason was sitting opposite Jasper, and when he saw Veronica coming, he pulled out a chair for her and asked, "What would you like to eat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Reed family's breakfast was naturally abundant. Veronica glanced at the sandwich and coffee that Mason was having and said, "I'll have what you're having."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A servant was preparing breakfast for Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were only four people sitting at the table now, including Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this time, everyone else had already finished breakfast and gone to work or school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, due to the Reed family and Veronica's situation causing a lot of commotion, Jasper didn't want to be questioned at school, so she took a few days off, and William naturally accompanied her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, William knew that the biggest reason Jasper took time off was probably because of Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When all the truth was laid out, the current Lawrence was no longer the same person as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the servant brought Veronica's meal, she picked up her sandwich and started eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, did you sleep with Mason last night?" Jasper's voice suddenly rang out in the dining room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ahem..." Veronica almost choked on her sandwich, and awkwardly covered her mouth with her hand. It took her a while to swallow the sandwich, and then she took a sip of coffee to moisten her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah, sorry, Veronica, are you okay?" Jasper quickly apologized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason gently patted Veronica's back and helped her breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm...I'm fine," Veronica said embarrassedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was just curious about my question earlier because I saw Mason coming out of your room in his pajamas this morning," Jasper explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt embarrassed and said, "Um...I couldn't sleep last night, so I asked Mason to keep me company for a while."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought she would have trouble sleeping because of what happened during the day, but maybe having Mason by her side made her feel at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So she chatted for a while and then fell asleep, sleeping until morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You guys have such a good relationship. If I can't sleep, Mason definitely won't come to keep me company," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason gave Jasper a blank look and said, "If you can't sleep, you can ask William to keep you company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason!" Jasper grumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, William's phone suddenly rang. After listening for a moment, his face changed slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the call ended, Jasper asked, "What happened? Is something wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lawrence...applied to withdraw from school and booked a flight to leave Emerald City tomorrow," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was surprised. "He's leaving?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," William replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After thinking for a moment, Jasper said, "Where is he now? Is he still at school?"</p></div>
