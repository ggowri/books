        <h1>Chapter 724</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why was he so quick to seek death? Why didn&rsquo;t he think about the son he still had? Did he know that if he died, what it would mean to Jason who was still so young at the time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did the man really think that sending Jason back to the Reed family was the best choice? He forgot that a child needs a father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason had already lost his mother's company, but then he lost his father too.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had to stay in such a house at such a young age, accompanied by a grandfather who hated the other half of his blood!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could almost imagine how he had walked on eggshells when he was a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In this mansion, there was no such thing as affection between two generations, only a child's struggle to survive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked step by step through the front hall and into the inner room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The interior was the same as what she had seen previously with Jay's father's memorial tablet on the altar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now, the tall figure stood motionless like a sculpture before the memorial tablet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His back was straight, and the dim light of the lamp fell upon him. The brightness interlaced with darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The loneliness he exuded right now seemed to shut off everything around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was the only person left in his world!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's nose suddenly felt a little sore, but she could not tell why she was feeling this way&ndash;Why she felt as if there was an invisible gap between Jason and her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they were the closest!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay!" she cried out, her voice ringing clearly in the silent room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tall body trembled a little before he slowly turned around. His ink-like eyes seemed to be staring at her with some sort of silent emptiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Grace felt as if her heart had skipped a beat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like the look in his eyes when she first met him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he did not care about anything, not even himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay!" she cried out again, with a touch of tension and uneasiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cry brought him back to his senses, and the dead silence in his eyes gradually faded and was replaced by his usual gentle eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you here?" he muttered, but with an indescribable weariness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I should be the one to ask you that. Why are you here so late at night?" she asked. Besides, it was not some special day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she came up to him. She raised her hand and touched his cheek gently, feeling the coolness on his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was already July, and the air conditioner here was not on. Even if was at night, </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">it was still hot and stuffy, but he was distinctly chilly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I couldn't sleep and thought of coming here," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you alright? Why&rsquo;s your face so cool?" She frowned. "It's so late. Let's go back to our room first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she was about to put down her hand and take his. However, she was held down by his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His palm pressed against the back of her hand, allowing her to continue to press against his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, those bright amorous eyes just stared at her quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's come over you?" She only felt something was a little off about him now. He was quiet and the dead silent look in his eyes made her uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Am I the only person you love the most?" His thin lips parted softly, his voice like the night wind that swept across the bamboo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," she replied without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll never betray me, right?" he added, and there was something fragile in that face that could captivate everyone.</p></div>
