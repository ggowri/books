        <h1>Chapter 656</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, there won't be any more misunderstandings like that. It's great that he has found the one he&rsquo;s looking for," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then the man would not cry like that anymore! The memory of Brian crying in front of her that night somehow flashed in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow, there was a tightness in her chest and a dull ache in her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stopped, raised her hand, and pressed it against one side of her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" Jason asked hastily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing, just... A sudden headache," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her slightly pale face, he said with a frown, "You don't look very well. Why don't we find a lodge nearby for you to rest awhile?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was not even a real hotel nearby, only a few lodges.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right," said Grace. The headache was only instantaneous, and the pain subsided as she spoke. "The pain is gone now. I want to go back and spend more time with Grandma."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, she added, "Jason, I'm going to stay here for three days. I'll return to Emerald City after Grandma's funeral. You should go back to the city first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you forgotten that I said I&rsquo;ll stay with you?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's going to take three days. You probably have a lot of your company's business to deal with, don't you? It's all right for me to be here alone. I'll just be... Sitting there looking at Grandma anyway," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At her grandmother's wake, she was more of an outsider. There was little conversation as she merely bowed at those who came to pay Grandma their last respects.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, her cousin Stella Lindsay was surrounded by people like a moon surrounded by stars. She was flattered and fawned over by the people around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace also knew that these changes were probably due to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No matter how many days you're staying here for, I'll stay with you. I don't trust you to stay here alone," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It'll be fine. First Uncle, Second Uncle, and Third Aunt now know who you are, so they don&rsquo;t dare to treat me like they used to." Grace was sure of that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, not many people would dare to offend Jason, not to mention her relatives who only preyed on the weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's one thing whether they dare to, and it's another for me to worry. I can only be assured if I stay with you," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, it was not only her relatives that worried him, there was&hellip; Someone else&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes darkened at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back at the Lu family's house. Sure enough, Grace saw Stella Lindsay being surrounded by their relatives and neighbors in town. They were making all sorts of flattering remarks, especially those hoping to get into the entertainment industry through Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay obviously enjoyed being flattered like this.</p></div>
