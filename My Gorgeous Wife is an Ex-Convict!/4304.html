        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, what surprised Chandler was that Tina kept appearing in front of him in the following days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a bit at a loss, but she said seriously, "You think it's just sympathy, and I want to know too. The best way to verify it is to spend more time together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina!" Chandler said, "What's the point of doing this now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't there any point?" Tina looked at him intently. "Do you no longer love me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Chandler paused. Faced with the face he </span><span>still loved,</span><span> he couldn't bring himself to say those insincere words. </span><span>So</span><span> he could only say, "I will slowly stop loving you. One day, I will be able to let you go."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Tina felt a pain in her chest!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't want him to let her go, not at all. The thought of this man in front of her no longer loving her made her deeply uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Almost instinctively, she grabbed him, pulled down his collar with force, and then stood on her tiptoes to kiss his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler was stunned. He didn't expect her to suddenly kiss him like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina kissed him with all her focus, feeling the warmth of Chandler's lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kiss made her feel familiar and attached as if they had kissed like this countless times before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After who knows how long, Tina finally ended the kiss, gasping for breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at Chandler and said, "Even if you want to let me go, I won't let you. Chandler, </span><span>do you really think my feelings for you are just sympathy?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pursed his lips tightly and pulled her hand, which was holding onto his collar, apart. "Tina, don't casually say things that you might regret in the future. Do you know what consequences you might face if I don't let you go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The longer he was tormented by the parasite, the less rational he would become.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the parasite in his body couldn't be successfully extracted, he might go crazy. Once his rationality diminished, it would mean that he would become increasingly unable to control himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, he might do crazy things driven by his instinctual desires.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Chandler's serious expression, Tina said, "But I'm not saying these things casually."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether you're saying them casually or not, just stop." He took a step back. "And from now on, don't come to me actively. We should keep some distance."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Chandler let his secretary into his office and said, "Help me escort Miss Stephenson out."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary cautiously approached Tina and said, "Miss Stephenson, please."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina let out a long breath. There was no need to rush things anyway. "Then I'll go back first." Besides, she could come and find him again tomorrow!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She returned home, where Hadwin and Lina were.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hadwin looked at his daughter and said, "I heard that you've been going to see Chandler frequently recently?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Tina admitted honestly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you and Chandler have already separated, then don't..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Hadwin finished speaking, Tina interrupted, "I want to get back together with Chandler."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Hadwin and Lina were both surprised by her words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to be with him again because I love him!" Tina said to her parents.</span></p></div>
