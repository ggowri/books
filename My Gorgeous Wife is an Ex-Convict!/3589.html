        <h1>Chapter 3587</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When William saw the appraisal result, he felt a complex emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was relieved, but he also felt heavy-hearted at the thought of Jasper's disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure enough, after Jasper learned of the appraisal result, he was stunned for a moment. "Roger, it's really not Lawrence?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," William said, handing the appraisal report to Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She trembled as she took the report, carefully examining it. After a moment, her eyes filled with mist and tears flowed from her eyes like pearls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, he really isn't..." Jasper muttered, his voice choked with emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William pulled out a tissue and gently wiped away the tears from the person in front of him. "Don't cry. If he isn't the one, we can keep looking. We'll find him someday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he wished that Roger was Lawrence instead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least if Roger was the one, Jasper wouldn't be so heartbroken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper suddenly exclaimed "Wow!" and hugged William tightly, burying her head in his arms and crying, "Do you think we won't find him? What if I never find Lawrence? What if Lawrence is already..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't bring herself to say it out loud, even though she had thought about the possibility countless times. She was afraid that if she said it, it would become a reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, that won't happen! Lawrence will be okay, we'll find him," William reassured her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Jasper's emotions gradually calmed down. "William, thank you. You always comfort me," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, he had comforted her countless times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He always acts as her stabilizer when she is emotionally unstable. Without him, she might have suffered more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can I lean on you a little longer?" she asked, leaning on his chest, feeling a sense of comfort and letting the pain in her heart gradually sink into a corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," William replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She leaned on him, almost putting most of her weight on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He remained still, allowing her to lean on him. He was like a steadfast harbor, embracing her like a small boat that seemed to be overturned by strong winds and heavy rain, keeping all the storms away from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a long while, Jasper slowly lifted her head and said, "I'm much better now." Her eyes were still red, making her slightly pale face look even paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your eyes are still red," he said, gently brushing his finger over the corner of her eye. "Remember to put some ice on them when you go back, or they'll swell up tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I got it," she said. "William, you're so good to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever she was sad or upset, he would always be there for her. Even when they were separated by distance for a long time, he would immediately video call her when he found out, and sometimes even rush to Emerald City overnight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, she even felt that the person who understood her the most in this world was not her parents, nor her siblings, but him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just hope you can be happy," William said. She knew that as long as she was happy, it would be more than enough for him.</p></div>
