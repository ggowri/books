        <h1>Chapter 933</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did he close the whole firm... so that I can rest at home?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is that possible? Would he have gone to all that trouble just to make me rest?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Otherwise, why is the firm closing for three days for no reason?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After washing up, Grace lay down in bed. Her injuries were less painful after applying the ointment. However, the moment she closed her eyes, she seemed to recall the incident today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was utterly reassured when he appeared before her. It was as if... Besides Lina, there was another person who was so protective of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the man who was so protective of her did not love her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His game of love with her was over, so when would this brother and sister game end?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one could tell her when!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the large room, Jason looked coldly at the two bodyguards who had their heads lowered. There was a bewildered look on their faces. Terrence seemed helpless too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is this how you protect her?" His tone was slightly raised, but it was still cold. Terrence shuddered instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Master Reed is... angry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Master Reed is really angry!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bodyguards kept quiet as fear flashed across their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence could only muster his courage to say, "Master Reed, they're also... trying to make amends for their faults. After seeing Miss Cummins pulled into the car, they planned to follow the kidnappers to their place to rescue her. However, they didn't expect..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more Terrence said, the more he was covered in a cold sweat. He could also feel his boss' sharp gaze on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If there was any mistake, he was probably going to get himself involved. After all, he was the one who chose these bodyguards to protect Grace in secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What a huge mistake it was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They didn't expect those kidnappers to do it in the car? I don't even know what would have happened to her by the time they saved her!&rdquo; Jason said coldly. Then, he stood up, walked over to the two bodyguards, and kicked them to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They're such great bodyguards! Great choice, Terrence!" Jason laughed mockingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a beautiful smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Terrence and the two bodyguards seemed to have seen the most terrifying thing ever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Please forgive us, Master Reed! Please forgive us, Master Reed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two bodyguards begged for mercy, but Jason did not even bother to look at them. He simply ordered his men to take the bodyguards out of the room and told Terrence, "They made such a mistake today. You should know how to punish them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!" replied Terrence as he shuddered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those two bodyguards probably could not be bodyguards again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, you know what to do with yourself. Go and punish yourself. If you make such a mistake again, I won't let you off the hook easily even though you've been following me for years," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence felt a quiver in his heart as he hurriedly responded. He did not let out the long sigh he had been holding in until he was out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even though Master Reed and Grace have broken up, Grace is still Master Reed's treasure. She can&rsquo;t get hurt&hellip; If Grace had suffered worse injuries today, would these two bodyguards still be able to live?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, if Master Reed got angry, no one in Emerald City would be able to calm him down!</p></div>
