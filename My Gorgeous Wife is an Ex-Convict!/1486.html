        <h1>Chapter 1485</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the only difference was that they were not sleeping in the same bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she was about to go to bed that night, he said, "I'll just sleep on the couch beside you. If I sleep on the bed, I'm afraid I'll touch you when I'm asleep." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was afraid that his touch might trigger another bad reaction from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, when Grace woke up the next day, she only saw Jason lying on the couch with his eyes closed, still asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She gently lifted the covers off herself and walked over to the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the past, he would always be awake when she woke up and rarely overslept. However, it was already past nine but he was still asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at Jason quietly, only feeling that he seemed thinner than before. He looked haggard even in his sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, there were some faint dark circles under his eyes. 'Has he not been sleeping well these days?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's brows suddenly wrinkled up. Then, his calm sleeping face seemed to become restless as a thin layer of sweat quickly broke out on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No... No... It definitely won't..." he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Won't what?" Grace was stunned and subconsciously raised her hand to touch his cheek. However, she could not help stiffening the moment she touched him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How can it be? I've decided to let the matter go and not dwell on what happened back then, but why is my body reacting this way?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could only withdraw her hand and shout at Jason, "Jay, Jay, wake up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hearing her voice, Jason immediately opened his eyes. His dark eyes were full of despair the moment they opened. The despair in his eyes only faded little by little when he caught sight of her. He breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? What did you dream about?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's nothing," he said, his eyelashes fluttering a little. He looked normal again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It seemed like you had a nightmare," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really? I don't remember." He smiled and said, "But even if I did, it's only a nightmare. I'm going to take a shower. I'm sweating a little."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said as he picked up a change of clothes and went into the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The warm water washed over his body, and Jason raised his hand to wipe the water on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had lied... just now. He remembered everything in his dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In his dream, Old Master Reed kept saying to him, "Jason, you're doomed if you stay with Grace! Sooner or later, you'll kill yourself if you love a woman too much and let her take charge of your life! This woman will leave you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed's voice was like a nightmare. There was still a lingering fear in Jason&rsquo;s heart even though he had woken up now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason instantly shook his head and told himself to stop thinking about what Old Master Reed had said in his dream. He probably only had this dream because he was worried about what Secretary Wang might do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Grace has already said she'll forgive me and won't leave me!'</p></div>
