        <h1>Chapter 851</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina widened her eyes as she looked at the blush on his cheeks. 'God... He&hellip; He's blushing. It's not true, is it? Is he really blushing?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help raising her hand to touch his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stiffened but did not stop her. He let her fingers caress his face. "What&hellip; are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wow! Hadwin, you're blushing..." She was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stiffened even more and turned his head away immediately. "Don't talk nonsense."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not talking nonsense..." Then, she saw that even his ears were red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand spared no effort in reaching for his ears. They were indeed red and burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't do that," he said, trying to pull her hand away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, let me touch them a little more. I haven't touched enough!" she cried out, unaware of the ambiguousness of her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin now felt as if he was being burned in a sea of flames. He wanted to pull her hand away, but his body seemed to love it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this the price of falling in love with someone? There are times when my mind and body seem to be in opposition when it comes to her.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was completely fascinated by Hadwin's increasingly red cheeks and ears. She only felt that her boyfriend was much purer and innocent than she imagined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Have I found a treasure?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin, you're so cute!" Lina could not resist putting her arms around Hadwin's neck and kissing him hard on the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they were not in the restaurant now, she would have thrown herself onto him on impulse!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin felt that his suffering had gotten more severe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina and Hadwin finished their meal, they paid the bill and left. However, they were surprised to see Jason at the restaurant's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was stunned, then immediately realized that the restaurant Hadwin took her to today was an elite restaurant in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People who usually patronized here were either rich or blue-blooded. Average people could not afford to dine here at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, it seemed quite normal to stumble into Jason here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was mad at Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He caused Grace to be traumatized by love, yet he was doing just fine!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Lina seemed to think of something and deliberately raised her volume as she said to Hadwin, "Oh, yes. Hadwin, let's bring Grace here next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin raised his eyebrows and took a look at his girlfriend who was suddenly speaking loudly. Then, he looked at Jason who was talking toward the same exit. He raised his eyebrows thoughtfully and said, "Sure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I don't know if Grace is free recently. She has someone pursuing her right now. I heard they're gonna dine together today. Some people may regard her as nothing, but she could be a piece of treasure in someone else&rsquo;s eyes!" Lina continued in a loud voice.</p></div>
