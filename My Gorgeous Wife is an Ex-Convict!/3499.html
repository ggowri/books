        <h1>Chapter 3497</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Downstairs, a car slowly drove out of the community.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside the car, Veronica kept her head down, silent and contemplative.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason tightly held Veronica's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you thinking about?" After a while, his voice echoed in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing...I'm not thinking about anything," Veronica murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's gaze deepened slightly. "I thought we were the closest people to each other! Aren't we?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica hesitated for a moment before saying, "I'm just thinking about Lionel."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you hope will happen to him?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What will happen to him?" Veronica asked in return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now those kidnappers all say he's the mastermind behind the scenes. They were recruited by him online, and even the money used to buy weapons was given by Lionel. Once the charge of being the mastermind is confirmed, even if he's still a minor, the crime won't be taken lightly. It's enough to sentence him to ten years in prison!" Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Ten years... Veronica was taken aback. Ten years of imprisonment, even though Lionel is still young, but ten years, which should have been the golden time for studying, if he really goes to jail, then Lionel's life will be hopeless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, based on her understanding of Lionel, even if he behaves recklessly, he should at least know what is important and what is not. He should know better than to kidnap Jasper, especially when Jasper and she entered the private room together. Lionel should have stopped this plan!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why still...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What... How did Lionel respond to this? What did he say in his statement?" Veronica asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not sure," Mason said. "Does Veronica think he could be the mastermind?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know," Veronica said. "Mason, I don't want Lionel to be falsely accused, and I also don't want him to really spend ten years in prison. Can you help him? I think there must be some hidden truth in all of this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she may not like her stepmother, she doesn't hold any major grudges against her half-brother Lionel. In fact, it could be said that Lionel has been trying to please her all these years, and even though his efforts may have been calculated, she still has some sibling affection towards him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Human emotions tend to accumulate little by little over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is Veronica feeling sorry for him?" Mason asked in a low voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" Veronica was taken aback, then she bit her lip slightly. "What did he say? He's still my brother, and we've been together for so many years. I believe he doesn't have the guts to do that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Little brother?" Mason murmured, "So, how much does he weigh in Veronica's heart?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside the carriage, there was a strange yet dangerous atmosphere. When Veronica looked up, she only saw Mason's deep black eyes staring at her intensely. In his gaze, there seemed to be a hint of something suspicious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She paused, wondering if he was going to do it again... Memories from her childhood flooded her mind - whenever Lionel tried to please her, he would act strangely and even become possessive, clinging to her and showing signs of jealousy.</p></div>
