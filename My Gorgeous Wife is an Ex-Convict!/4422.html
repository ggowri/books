        <h1>Chapter 4420: Won't Leave Him With Nothing</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Elledge is now directly threatening Harley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley stared at Mr. Elledge, trying to figure out if he was telling the truth. Tens of millions--if others knew Mr. Elledge was Calvert's father, they might indeed consider lending the money!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Hart, the money I'm asking for is just a small amount for you. Since you love my son, this little bit of money shouldn't matter to you, right?" The other person said shamelessly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Harley could even speak, the office door was suddenly flung open. Calvert stormed in, his face flushed with anger, and he confronted Mr. Elledge, "Why are you harassing Harley again? If you show up one more time, I'm calling the cops and charging you with extortion! Then you can just sit in jail!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Elledge glared at his son, "If you were willing to give me money, why would I even be here? And think about it, if I really end up in jail, do you think you can still make it in showbiz with a dad who's been behind bars? Even with the Hart family backing you up, do you really think you'll make it big? When you've got nothing left in the future, the Hart family will just see you as a dog they can kick away anytime!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I truly have nothing, it's my own choice!" Calvert said, "Anyway, you need to leave right now and never bother Harley again!" Calvert insisted.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, getting bold, are you? Daring to talk to me like that!" Mr. Elledge said furiously. "When you truly have nothing, I want to see how you'll cry. Do you really think the Hart family will take you in? If you don't make the most of it now, you'll end up with nothing!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert wanted to say something more, but Harley stopped him, stepping in front of him to face Mr. Elledge directly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why can't I accept him? My parents actually like Calvert quite a bit," Harley chuckled. "Besides, when I first met Calvert, he had nothing. So even if he ends up with nothing again in the future, I'll still like him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Mr. Elledge looked utterly astonished. After a long pause, he finally shook his head slightly, "You're joking, right? Just to contradict me? If that day really comes..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When that day actually comes, just watch whether I'll abandon him or not! I think, Uncle, you've probably never truly loved someone. If you had, you'd understand what I'm saying today," Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mr. Elledge finally left with his tail between his legs, and of course, as he left, he gritted his teeth and said, "Fine, I'll be waiting to see!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Mr. Elledge left, Calvert hung his head low, completely losing his earlier momentum, and looked just like a poor little thing!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm... I'm sorry..." he stammered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because your father came to see me?" Harley retorted, "You don't need to apologize for that. It's not something you can control."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But he's still my dad. If you hadn't been with me, you wouldn't have had to deal with this harassment," he said, full of remorse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if I hadn't started dating you, I would never have known how joyful it is to find out that the person you like likes you back!" Harley said, gently cradling Calvert's face. "Calvert, I like you, so I'm willing to accept everything about you."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her, a slight sting in his nose. How could he not love such a Harley!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him on the lips. "Also, everything I told your father was from the heart. Even if you had nothing, I would still love you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, with her around, she wouldn't let him end up with nothing!</span></p></div>
