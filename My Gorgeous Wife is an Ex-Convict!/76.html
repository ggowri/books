        <h1>Chapter 75</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean was stunned. "Grace!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Zoe saw her brother, she immediately went forward and complained, "Brother, you have no idea how shameless this bitch was just now! She asked me to buy her a dress worth millions! She doesn't realize that she isn't even fit to wear such a dress!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Shut your mouth!" Sean scolded her on the spot, and his expression turned ugly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was his sister not afraid of anything?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The person backing Grace was none other than Jason Reed. The man was a billionaire. Forget about a dress that cost millions. There wasn&rsquo;t an object in this world that Jason Reed couldn&rsquo;t afford.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Brother, what's wrong with you? Why are you raising your voice at me? I'm talking about Grace," Zoe argued. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a friggin&rsquo; convict!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's there to say?" Sean said grumpily. He couldn&rsquo;t reveal the truths that he knew about Grace&rsquo;s true patron. And he couldn&rsquo;t afford to humiliate her and chance it getting back to Jason Reed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean turned to the clerk next to him and said, "Pack up that dress."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His sudden words shocked everyone in the store.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sean, what are you doing? Are you going to give the dress to Grace?" Zoe asked in disbelief. &ldquo;Seriously!?!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As for Lily, her lips pressed into a thin line and her eyes narrowed in unmasked anger.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">On the other hand, the salesgirl looked pleasantly surprised. She could earn a lot of commission if this sale went through.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&rdquo;Grace, I'm sorry. Zoe's words were a bit rude, but she didn't mean any harm. Please don't hold a grudge against her. This dress&hellip; here &ndash; just take it as an apology." Sean's tone was extremely humble.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe looked at her brother in disbelief. "Brother, what gives her the right to make you gift her a dress? And we're even apologizing to her now? Who does she think she is?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The more Zoe spoke, the more Sean worried. Damn it, his sister needed to shut up! She had no idea of the consequences&hellip;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If Grace said something in front of Jason Reed&hellip;he could obliterate all of the Stevens Family holdings. &ldquo;Enough, Zoe.&rdquo; He turned to his ex."Grace, you won't take offense to what Zoe's saying, right?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean raked a hand through his hair. This whole situation was embarrassing and that didn&rsquo;t even begin to describe the daggers that Lily was all but shooting at him. He made it a point not to look at her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace&rsquo;s brows drew together. She wasn&rsquo;t a stupid woman, and she had to be wondering why he&rsquo;d go out of his way to defend her or to make his own sister apologize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace&rsquo;s eyes lit up and Sean could pinpoint the moment when she realized she had the upper hand. Grace pursed her lips and said, "You know, you&rsquo;re right, I don&rsquo;t need that dress.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe all but crowed as if by rejecting the dress, Grace was proving all the other things Zoe&rsquo;d said were right.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace tapped her lips. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to give me the dress. Just give me cash. Mr. Stevens, you should have a checkbook on you, right?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She knew that Sean had the habit of bringing a checkbook along with him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean was obviously stunned for a moment, but even though he recovered fairly quickly, he didn&rsquo;t react in time to control his sister.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;You bitch!&rdquo; Zoe glared at Grace with hatred. "How dare you ask for money!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why wouldn't I? Miss Stevens, didn't you say that you would buy me something from the store? I'm just exchanging it for cash. Nothing more," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace had been playing a bluff with every intention of letting Sean beg off and drag his deplorable sister and fiancee out of the store with him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're crazy for money, aren't you?" Zoe shook her head with disgust, "Don't think my brother will..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, by this time, Sean had already taken out the checkbook, filled out the amount, and handed it directly to Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Brother!" Zoe shouted.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Enough! You already promised earlier, it's only natural that you keep your word! I'm helping you fulfill the promise!" Sean turned to Grace and forced a smile. "Here, this check is for you."</p></div>
