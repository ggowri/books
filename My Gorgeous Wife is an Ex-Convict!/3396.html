        <h1>Chapter 3394</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasmine, I'm fine. Mom said as long as I stay in the hospital and take my medicine every day, I'll be able to leave soon!" said Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really... can I be discharged soon?" Jasmine said with teary eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Exactly, very fast!" said Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So... when will your hair grow longer?" Jasmine furrowed her brows again with two small lines.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Talking about her hair, Harley is also quite sad. Her mom said that because she had surgery on her head, her hair had to be shaved off. She'll have to wait for some time before her hair can grow back again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She really liked her braids and had many pretty hair accessories, but now they are all useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait for me to be discharged from the hospital," said Harley gloomily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you really get engaged to someone?" Jasmine thought of this question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right," nodded Harley, bobbing her little head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So... will he help you fight in the future?" Jasmine asked again, showing that they often hang out together and think alike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure, he and I made a deal. If anyone bullies me, he'll help me fight!" said Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasmine looked enviously and said, "That's great. I also want to get engaged to someone so that I have someone to fight for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason raised an eyebrow as he watched his little daughter, who is only six years old, accompany him to the hospital to visit Harley. This child already wants to have a fianc&eacute;?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shall I help you find one after that?" Harley said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though Jason is known for his strong composure, he couldn't help but feel a bit bewildered after hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Jasmine nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And so, the two children hooked their pinkies together and made a promise that Harley would help Jasmine find her future husband.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason was left speechless!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After leaving the hospital, Jason held his daughter's hand and asked, "If Jasmine wants a future husband, how about Daddy helps you find one? No matter what kind of person you like, Daddy can find him for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whatever his daughter wants, he will do his best to make it happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter what kind of guy his daughter likes, he will help her get him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Jasmine shook her head and said, "No, Harley promised me that he will help me find one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Jason, who is usually so strong, suddenly felt like he was going to vomit blood. His own daughter didn't trust him, her own father, and instead trusted a three-year-old child who is even younger than her? "Do you really think she can find someone you like?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes!" Jasmine said with unwavering trust. "Harley always keeps his promises, and we even hooked our pinkies together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason was speechless. He just waited for Harley to find a suitable partner for their daughter in the future. When Jasmine grows up, she will understand the meaning of "once bitten, twice shy"!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for Tina and Chandler visiting Harley at the hospital, Tina specifically told Harley about the things a fianc&eacute; should do for his fianc&eacute;e.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley listened with wide eyes, as if a new world had opened up to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is having a fianc&eacute; really that great?" Apparently, a fianc&eacute; can not only help with fighting, but also play with her, buy things for her, give her pocket money, and even help with homework.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Harley doesn't have homework yet, she will soon be going to kindergarten where there will be homework and lots of crafts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It turns out that a fianc&eacute; can also do these things for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley suddenly felt that having a fianc&eacute; was a very good thing.</p></div>
