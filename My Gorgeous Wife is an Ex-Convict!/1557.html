        <h1>Chapter 1555</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, it was becoming exceedingly certain that Young master Reed had not forgotten his feelings for Young Madam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian was still standing there when the two figures disappeared before him. His handsome face was full of pain and disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The crown prince who ruled the entertainment industry was now just a poor man who could not get what he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After Jason took Grace into the main house, he quickly let go of her hand and said somewhat coldly, "It seems there's a lot of history between you and Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Huh?" Grace looked at Jason's seemingly unhappy face and quickly said, "Nothing's going on between him and me. I didn't expect him to suddenly show up today. Besides, I already&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before she could finish, he interrupted coldly, "You don't need to tell me what happened between you and him or what happened today. I'm not interested either. You just have to remember that you're Mrs. Reed now. Don't do anything to disgrace the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, he went upstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stared at the man's back in silence. 'What does he mean by not disgracing the Reed family? Nothing's going on between Brian and me! He would never have said that if it were back then.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It seemed that she still had to find an opportunity to explain things to him, lest he misunderstood!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was still cold during dinner, and the atmosphere was very suffocating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace suddenly felt as if she was being given the cold shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Jasper asked, "Mommy, does Daddy love you? Uncle Hart said Daddy doesn't love you. Will I have a stepmother in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace almost choked on the food she had barely swallowed. "Stepmother?" What on earth was her daughter thinking?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although she had consciously covered her daughter's ears during her conversation with Brian, it seemed that her daughter still heard some of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed's small body also stiffened after hearing this. Although he did not open his mouth to ask questions, his beautiful peach eyes were wide open, looking at Grace and Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mommy, didn't you say that Daddy loves you to death and he loves you more than anything in the world? If Daddy doesn't love you and gets us a stepmother, will I be as miserable as Cinderella or Snow White?" Jasper asked piteously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help being impressed with her daughter for thinking of unfounded things with her tiny head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before she even spoke, Jason turned to Grace and said, "I love you to death and I love you more than anything in the world?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's face could not help turning red. It was what she had said to her daughter before they came to Emerald City in hopes that her daughter would have a good impression of the father she had never met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, uh... she had spoken the truth. At least, it was the case before he lost his memory!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I have Mommy now. I don't want to have a stepmother," Mick Reed said abruptly. His dark eyes stared at them as he asked, "Are you going to get divorced?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Of course not!" Grace said quickly. 'Are kids this precocious these days? Do they know what's divorce... at such a young age?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the little one was still looking at them. Strictly speaking, he was looking at Jason, waiting for his father's answer.</p></div>
