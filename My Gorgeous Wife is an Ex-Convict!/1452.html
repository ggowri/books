        <h1>Chapter 1451</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Unable to do anything about her insistence, he eventually agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, they went to the hospital together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When they arrived at the hospital, Jason asked the bodyguards who followed them to watch over Grace. He then walked into the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the ward, the scrawny Old Master Reed was lying on the white hospital bed. A man who used to be so powerful was eventually reaching the end of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed was trying to hold on. When he saw Jason walking in, he trembled and said, "You... You've come..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, I'm here," replied Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">One could say that he did not have much affection for Old Master Reed. The relationship they shared was more like that of a mentor and a trainee.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The trainee could be gotten rid of at any time, just like a chess piece. If it was useful, it could remain on the chessboard. If it was useless, it would only be discarded like a sacrifice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The Reed family is... Is yours now... If you fail... the Reed family, I won't let you live in peace..." said Old Master Reed as he gasped with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is that all you want to tell me?" asked Jason as he stared at Old Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed's cloudy eyes moved. "That girl Grace is... outside, isn't she? Ask... Ask her to come in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's eyes suddenly narrowed. "Don't touch her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm afraid I can't touch her... even if I want to. You must have... many of your men outside." After all, Jason was the heir he raised. Old Master Reed could guess what his grandson would do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his lips together and said nothing. He seemed to be hesitating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I just... have a few words... to say to her..." Old Master Reed spoke with more and more difficulty, and his gasping became louder. It seemed that he was making the last struggle at the end of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason finally walked out of the ward. Moments later, he took Grace by the hand and walked back inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The heavily pregnant Grace looked at Old Master Reed, who was dying, on the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The old man had once struck terror into her heart from being so frightfully heartless. However, the old man whom she had been so scared of was now lying so weakly, doing his best to&hellip; hold on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grandpa, you're Jay&rsquo;s grandfather and I'm Jay&rsquo;s wife now, so I'll call you Grandpa too. Of course, I can call you &lsquo;Old Master&rsquo; if you don't like it," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed seemed not to care about the appellation at all. He only asked, "Do you... love Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," she answered without any hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason had been holding Grace's hand since they came in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then... let's make a bet... and see if you... really love Jason that much..." stammered Old Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Bet?" Grace's eyes sparkled with doubt, but then she said, "I don't think I need to make a bet to prove whether I love Jay or not. I love him. I know it, he knows it, and that's enough."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You know? You... don't know anything... You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grandpa!&rdquo; Jason suddenly interrupted Old Master Reed. "I love Grace. She's the only woman I&rsquo;ll ever love, and as long as I&rsquo;m in charge, she&rsquo;ll be the only mistress of the Reed family. There won't be another woman!&rdquo;</p></div>
