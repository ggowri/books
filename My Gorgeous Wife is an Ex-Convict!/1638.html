        <h1>Chapter 1636</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina's heart melted at the words. Grace had done everything she could to protect her when she was seriously injured. She was still the same as she was then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina said, "Okay, got it. Grace, it's nice to have a friend like you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson looked coldly at a video on the phone. It showed Hadwin Stephenson taking Lina away in front of a large crowd of reporters. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The video was only a minute long, but Katherine Jackson had watched it over and over again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her face grew colder and colder each time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her parents had called to ask her what was going on. She wanted to ask Hadwin Stephenson too, but... she just could not get in touch with him. She had called him several times but got no answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She went to Hadwin Stephenson's men, but they only beat around the bush and gave her a bunch of nonsense!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After turning off the video, Katherine Jackson pondered for a moment before getting up and driving to Hadwin Stephenson's villa in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Security guards stopped Katherine Jackson when she got to the villa's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't you know who I am?" snapped Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Stephenson said that outsiders aren't allowed to enter the villa unless he permits it," the security guard said. Apparently, Katherine Jackson was listed as an &lsquo;outsider&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson glared at them. "Then tell Hadwin Stephenson he'd better let me in if he doesn't want me to go after his precious baby. Otherwise, he'll be the one who regrets it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, the security guards had to contact the villa. They let Katherine Jackson in after a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson's face was grim. She did not expect that she had to one day use Lina&rsquo;s name to enter this villa!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she walked into the villa, she saw Hadwin Stephenson sitting on a couch in the living room, drinking a cocktail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew he had concocted it himself. She had seen him drink it many times and concoct it himself over the past five years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson knew Hadwin Stephenson preferred this cocktail but did not know that Lina liked it. That was the very reason why he learned to make it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So you can't let Lina go after all! You let me in as soon as I mentioned her. Were you going to keep shutting me out if I hadn't brought up her name?" Katherine Jackson asked with a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You shouldn't have gone after her," Hadwin Stephenson said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I shouldn't have gone after her? Did you ever think about me when you left holding her hand in front of all those reporters today? What do you want me to say to those reporters now? Don't forget, we're about to get married!" Katherine Jackson showed a rare exasperated side of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That's because you went after her. I told you a long time ago not to touch her!" Hadwin Stephenson's voice was cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson was shocked. 'He knows?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What Hadwin Stephenson said next made embarrassment flash through Katherine Jackson's face.</p></div>
