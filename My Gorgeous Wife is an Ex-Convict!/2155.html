        <h1>Chapter 2153</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, enough is enough, so let's leave it at that. Just let me go, okay?" murmured Kyla. She loved and hated the man before her. It eventually became a complicated feeling, and she did not know how to face him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Kyla turned to return home and closed the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss stood outside alone as if only a soulless body was left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's health recovered quickly ever since she woke up. She could already get out of bed slowly the next day, and she looked perfectly normal by the fifth day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Due to her health and the medications she had to take, she could not feed the baby. Therefore, she had no more breast milk. Lina somewhat regretted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, at least she and the baby were alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina beamed as she held her daughter in the ward. Though the baby was skinny and looked like a little monkey after being born prematurely, Lina found her baby beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Especially those eyes that looked like Hadwin Stephenson's. They would probably look so stunning that she would look like Helen of Troy after she grew up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina immediately denied it and said to herself, ''Bah! She&rsquo;ll look like Aphrodite!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You keep smiling foolishly as you look at our daughter. Others will think you're possessed," teased Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hehe! My daughter's my savior. I have to take good care of her," said Lina as she could not help kissing the baby's face again. &ldquo;I keep having a feeling that my baby's special. She charmed the mysterious boy from the Hunter family when she was still in my belly. Would they have a fairy-tale-like love story in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace could not help but be impressed with her best friend's imagination. However, thanks to her best friend's optimism, she did not dwell on it. If it were someone else, they would be crying their eyes out about the engagement every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How do you know that your daughter charmed that boy?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "Isn't that what happens in novels and movies? The child has good looks too. Few boys are that good-looking. As long as he doesn't turn out ugly, it won't be difficult for my daughter to fall in love with him. I just don't know how mysterious the Hunter family is. Do they have a lot of family rules? It&rsquo;ll seem troublesome if they do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace chuckled. "Don't get too far ahead of yourself. We don't know what will happen in the future. But if Tina really doesn't like the boy from the Hunter family, we'll find a way to break off the engagement. We'll find a way no matter what." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But it isn't easy to find one who is better-looking than that boy," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was speechless. "Do you think looks will matter to Tina as much as they matter to you?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Maybe." The two women chatted and laughed. "Oh yes, you're getting discharged tomorrow, aren't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, I'm bored to death in the hospital. I'm finally getting discharged!" Lina's expression looked like she was liberated. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How about I bring the kids to your place this weekend? Jasper keeps asking about meeting the baby, said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "Sure, Kyla also said she would bring Nelson to my place this weekend. We can get together. Hehe! Oh yes. You don't have to come over and help when I discharge from the hospital tomorrow. My parents and Hadwin will be around tomorrow. It&rsquo;ll be chaotic if there are too many people around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, got it. Just focus on your confinement! I'll see you this weekend!" Grace said with a smile.</p></div>
