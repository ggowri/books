        <h1>Chapter 1359</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the court had sentenced her to three and a half years in prison, she still insisted that she was innocent. In her opinion, at least she still had her dignity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, whatever she had left was trampled to pieces by Martin Weiss today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But I guess it's alright. That way, there's really nothing left between Martin Weiss and me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels, who was in the suite, seemed to suddenly come back to her senses. She quickly approached Martin Weiss and said, "Martin, calm down. It doesn't matter whether she apologizes or not. I just want you to be okay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss rubbed the area in between his brows. "You deserve the apology!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But what's the point of an apology if it&rsquo;s against her will?" Paisley Daniels leaned in Martin Weiss's arms as she spoke, "Martin, maybe Kyla Corbyn is approaching you again because we're getting married. Maybe she did this on purpose to make you care for her because she's unwilling. I really don't want you to have anything more to do with this woman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why would I care about her? Don't worry, our wedding will go on as planned. Only you will be the future mistress of the Weiss family! It won't be anyone else," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels showed a smile of satisfaction on her face and looked up to kiss Martin Weiss on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his face turned slightly to one side as he avoided her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels was shocked, and her expression changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Paisley, I'm a little tired and want to rest first. I've already booked your flight. I'll have someone bring you to the airport," he said as he pushed her out of his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels looked at Martin Weiss's figure with some awkwardness and could not help asking, "Martin, what Kyla Corbyn said in the end... Well... what did you promise her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing," Martin Weiss replied lightly. He walked into the bedroom and closed the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels clenched her teeth with hatred. 'I'm the one he's marrying, but why do I feel like I will never get into his heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Damn that Kyla Corbyn!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla Corbyn returned home, she found Grace playing with Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson, you gotta be careful when you play with Aunt. Aunt has baby brothers and sisters in her belly. They're still little and can get hurt easily, so you can't bump into Aunt, okay?" Kyla Corbyn said quickly, fearing that her son might get overly excited and bump into Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled and said, "Don't worry, Nelson is more careful than me. He said hello to his baby brothers and sisters as soon as I got here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was already more than four months along, and her bump was gradually showing. As she was carrying triplets, her baby bump was bigger than usual pregnant women who were more than four months along. It made her hands and feet seem more slender.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if all the weight had gone to her belly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson said seriously, "I'll be a good older brother. After my baby brothers and sisters are born, I'll teach them how to play with toys, give them delicious food, and teach them how to draw and read..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one counted with his fingers as if eager to teach his unborn baby brothers and sisters everything he knew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her son, a smile could not help appearing on the corners of Kyla Corbyn's lips. It was only at moments like this that she would long to live.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, it's a bit late now. Aren't you afraid of worrying Jason if you're not home yet?" Kyla Corbyn said to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "It'll be fine. Besides, I wanted to wait till you got back and I saw you before I left. By the way, how about we bring Nelson out to play next weekend? I haven't played with Nelson for a long time."</p></div>
