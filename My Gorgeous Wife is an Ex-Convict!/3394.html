        <h1>Chapter 3392</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda and Brian were inside with Harley, who had just woken up. The couple had tender expressions on their faces as they talked to their daughter, with smiles on their faces.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And although the little one can only lie down and cannot even make any movements, he/she listens particularly attentively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, Lornell felt an indescribable feeling. It was as if he also wanted to go in, say something to her, touch her face and hands, and tell her his name!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Would she be happy if she knew?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Lornell finally came face to face with Harley, it was already 10 days after Harley had been transferred back to a regular hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley at the moment has bandages wrapped around his head, and his complexion appears somewhat pale and not rosy. He is also wearing a hospital gown, and overall looks a bit sickly. However, his bright and lively phoenix eyes are still full of grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at this Harley, Lornell began to reminisce about the old days when she used to fight. She was so spirited back then, even though her fighting style was completely chaotic and disorganized. It was actually quite entertaining.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to know my name? I can choose not to tell you," Lornell said, raising her small chin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But Mommy and Daddy already told me!" the little one blinked, "They said your name is Lornell, right? But I don't know how to write those three characters yet. I can only write my own name for now. But my name has a lot of strokes. Does your name have fewer strokes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell was surprised when, as he was about to tell the other person his name, they asked him whether his name had more or fewer strokes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not many," he said, his little face tightening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her face immediately showed disappointment. "My mommy said that when I get better, I have to learn to write your name because you're my lifesaver."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lifesaver?" He was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, my mommy said that you begged your dad to save me, so you and your dad are my lifesavers. Do you know what a lifesaver is? It's someone who saves someone else's life and needs to be thanked properly..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell suddenly realized that even though this little one was injured, lying in bed, and sick, she still talked as much as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lornell brother, thank you! You're my great benefactor!" The little one's face lit up with a brilliant smile as she spoke to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her smile and couldn't help but stare.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her smile was actually very beautiful, and he seemed to still like watching her smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not your brother, I'm your fianc&eacute;." Lornell still felt it necessary to correct her and let the little one understand her current identity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley blinked. "What's a fianc&eacute;?" For a 3-year-old like her, this term was a bit beyond her understanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell thought for a moment and said, "Just like Chandler and Tina."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley started to think about it. She had heard from her sister Tina that when Tina grows up, she will marry Chandler, just like how mommy married daddy. They will live happily together and have babies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, are she and this brother Lornell going to live together in the future and have a baby?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But why are you my fianc&eacute;?" she asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because if I wasn't your fianc&eacute;, my family wouldn't have saved you, and you would have died," he said very bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, don't expect a 7-year-old child to speak in a very tactful way to a 3-year-old child.</p></div>
