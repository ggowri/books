        <h1>Chapter 553</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the years went by, the hideous scar became shallower and shallower, but it remained there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With today's technology, he could easily choose to remove the scar with high-tech methods, but he never did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if to remind himself of something with the scar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the source of his insecurity toward relationships was his mother, what about her? She was also an insecure person. Due to Sean's betrayal, she was even afraid of love. She once thought she might live alone for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, it was he who gave her that sense of security and made her want to love someone again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?" Jason looked up just in time to catch Grace's almond-shaped eyes. The way she was looking at him was with distress mixed with compassion and pity, as well as other emotions that he could not understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly came to her senses and shook her head. "Nothing. I just realized that I love you very much." As she spoke, she bent over gently and put her hands around his neck. "I'll be good to you, Jay. I'll always be good to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he lacked security, she would give him security.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like two people warming themselves. Not only did she get warmth from him, but she also wanted to pass it on to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body gave a slight shudder while his dark eyes looked at her with awe. Then, a smile slowly rose from the corners of his mouth. His thin lips parted, saying, "Then, it's settled."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was sent to the small restaurant in a Bentley by Jason, which drew a few sidelong glances from the rest of the staff. However, since Jason had been here before, all the staff knew that Grace found a rich boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they did not know that the rich boyfriend was actually Jason, Emerald City's local tyrant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace saw Kyla, she could only see that Kyla looked tired and had faint dark circles under her eyes. It was obvious that she had not slept well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You didn't get a good night's rest, Kyla? Is it because of Martin Weiss?" Grace asked in a whisper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled bitterly. "A little. I've been hiding from him since getting out of prison. I'm afraid of being found by him, and I'm afraid that the peace I have now will be ruined."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what she feared most was that Martin Weiss would take Nelson away from her. Even though Nelson was never the child he wanted, there was a chance&hellip; He would do that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, what the man wanted most was to see her in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even though he's now in Emerald City, the city is too big for him to bump into you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope so." Kyla hoped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just wanted to protect the small restaurant and her son so that he would grow up safely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After everything she had been through, she realized that peace was a blessing. As for Grace... Kyla looked at Grace, wishing to speak. However, she stopped on a second thought. She was not sure whether it was a blessing or a curse that Grace was dating Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though many women were after a man like Jason, how many women dared to love him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if Jason favored Grace now, what about the future? How many people could bear a man like him turning his back on them?</p></div>
