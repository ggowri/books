        <h1>Chapter 2374</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was evidently Emerald City Airport that she had left earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately looked up and around. Sure enough, the bright letters that read &lsquo;Emerald City welcomes you&rsquo; not far away caught her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this... Emerald City?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Were my five hours on the plane only a spin in the air?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is going on here? It&rsquo;s a plane ticket to a foreign country! How did this happen? Besides... why didn't the other passengers raise any objections? They look calm.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jacqueline Bowman saw a police car approaching, her pupils shrank as if she realized something. Her expression changed, and her legs began to go weak. She could hardly stand!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, the police car stopped in front of her. The officers walked up to her, saying, "Jacqueline Bowman, you&rsquo;re under arrest. You have to come with us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I didn't do anything! The court let me off on probation! Besides, I haven't left the country. You have no reason to arrest me!" Jacqueline Bowman said in a shrill voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the two policemen held her down without any explanation and handcuffed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let go of me. You&rsquo;re arresting people arbitrarily. I&rsquo;ll lodge a complaint! I&rsquo;ll tell the media about this! Why are you arresting me? I'm not a criminal!" shouted Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've been a prisoner since the beginning!&rdquo; At this moment, another voice rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman looked over and saw a black car driving over. Grace and Kyla got out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean? The court has let me go on probation! I'm on probation. I didn't break the law. Why am I being arrested?" Jacqueline Bowman said before looking at Kyla. "Kyla, defend me! I did as per our agreement. Y-You can't abandon me after I helped you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's face had a mixture of disappointment and bitterness. "Jacqueline Bowman, the address you gave doesn't exist. There&rsquo;s no Huaixin Road No. 398 in Kang City. The unit number is only up till No. 351!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had previously warned her that Jacqueline Bowman might be making things up and she may not have Amber Mitchell's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she still had a glimmer of hope until they realized that the address Jacqueline Bowman texted them did not exist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman's expression changed slightly as she said, "I... I was mistaken. It should be No. 298!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? Are you sure she stays in No. 298? Jacqueline Bowman, what should we do if we still can't find Amber Mitchell in No. 298?" Grace asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman's expression changed again. However, she did not casually say she had made a mistake like before. Instead, she glared fiercely at Grace. "If you can't find her, you can't find her. I've gotten out on probation and haven't broken any law. You have no right to detain me! I&rsquo;ll sue the Reed family and the police if you continue to detain me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, another voice rang out. "Sue us, then. Do you think it's that easy to take 30 million U.S. dollars from the Reed family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman shuddered and stared at Jason, cold sweat pouring out of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Y-Young master Reed, I&hellip; I can give up the 30 million U.S. dollars. I... I didn&rsquo;t blackmail anyone. Your... Your wife and Kyla gave it to me! I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason did not want to bother listening to her statement. He just said indifferently to the police officers who were holding her down, "Take her back. Thank you for today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two policemen then took Jacqueline Bowman to the car.</p></div>
