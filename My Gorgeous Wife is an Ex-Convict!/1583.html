        <h1>Chapter 1581</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, his carelessness that year made it so that he could never be with Lina again. He did not even... have the right to be with her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson lowered his eyes, hiding the glint in them. "If you really want a wedding, it&rsquo;s possible. Once I settle my business in Emerald City, I'll go to your family and discuss our wedding&rsquo;s matters."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?" Katherine Jackson looked delighted. She did not expect Hadwin Stephenson to agree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Since I&rsquo;m already saying so, do you think it could be false?" Hadwin Stephenson asked lightly. As he looked at Katherine Jackson, his gaze suddenly turned sharp. "But you can't touch Lina. I'll take you down with me if you dare touch her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson froze. The glint in the man's eyes was terrifying! Even though he agreed to marry her, he still had no feelings for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I refuse to believe it! Sooner or later, I'll have Hadwin Stephenson fall for me! Lina is a nobody! She'll probably be old and ugly in a few years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Who is Lina to compete for a man with me? Lina was just lucky to know Hadwin first. If I got to know Hadwin first, then I&rsquo;d be the one Hadwin loves now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson took a deep breath and slowly smiled. There was a gleam of certainty in her eyes. "Okay, I won't touch her, but I'm going to be Mrs. Stephenson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked elegant and noble in the limited edition black gown. She had on matching heels, delicate makeup, and wore a ruby necklace around her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Today was her first formal appearance at a banquet in five years. Grace was, of course, all dressed up. After all, as the mistress of the Reed family, she could not humiliate herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had prepared a nice pearl necklace for herself, but after putting on her gown, Jason personally put the ruby necklace on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's a nice necklace, and it matches your gown today," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why do you have a women's necklace?" she asked curiously. After all, she had just bought the gown. Even if he had gone to get matching jewelry, he could not have done it so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I bought it some time ago. I came across this necklace and suddenly thought of buying it," said Jason. What he did not say was that he had somehow bought the necklace on impulse when he saw it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as though he was subconsciously waiting for her and the day he could give her the necklace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As Grace looked into the mirror at the ruby necklace around her neck, she remembered having told him that ruby was her birthstone since she was born in July.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Was that why he bought a ruby necklace when he did not need to?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace took Jason's arm, feeling the gazes all around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The corners of her lips raised a little. She was not scared and graciously allowed others to look at her. Some of these people expected Mrs. Reed to be unseemly or nouveau riche-like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, what they saw was a demure, elegant, generous, and confident woman!</p></div>
