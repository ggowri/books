        <h1>Chapter 2982</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda's forehead almost hit the computer screen. "Photos?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, wait a minute, I'll send you the website, you can take a look. I see the gossip is getting hotter and hotter, and many people are discussing whether it's the prince or not!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Camille ended the call, she sent the website.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda opened the website and saw the photo of her and Brian at the crawfish restaurant last night. It was indeed taken by someone, and not just photos, but also some short videos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The focus of the discussion below was, "Is this really the prince?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you stupid? If it's the prince, would he go to this kind of place to eat crawfish? Shouldn't he go to a high-end restaurant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But it really looks like him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"With this appearance, he could participate in an impersonation show. Does the prince know that someone looks so much like him? Could it be a long-lost twin brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I really hope he becomes famous, so he can play the lead in a movie or TV show!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That woman next to him is so lucky to be his girlfriend. I hope they break up soon so I can take her place!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if they break up, you won't have a chance. This guy and his looks are probably being taken care of by many rich and beautiful women!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda couldn't help but feel a bit amused and frustrated reading these comments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Regardless, most of the comments actually believed that the person in the video wasn't Brian, but just someone who looked like him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After hesitating for a moment, Valda called Brian. "Brian, there's a video and photos of us at the crawfish restaurant online. I'm worried that if it goes viral, it might not be good for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I already know about it, and I'll take care of it," Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, that's good to hear," Valda said. Since he already knew, there must be a way to handle it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, do you mind telling people that you're my girlfriend?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked puzzled. "Why would I mind? We're dating openly and honestly. There's nothing to be ashamed of."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Brian said. "I have some things to take care of, so I might be back late tonight. I'll have the driver pick you up after work."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need to trouble the driver, I can take the subway back myself," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Be good, let the driver pick you up. I'll feel better," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word "be good" made Valda's face blush a little. She felt like he was coaxing a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But to have someone treat her like a child made her truly happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That night, Valda waited for Brian in the living room of the villa. He said he would be back late, so she didn't know when he would return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She watched the TV show that was playing, even though it was one she loved, she felt bored.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She casually changed the channel, then suddenly her gaze was fixed on the TV screen and she stopped pressing the remote.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the TV screen was a familiar face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And this program is an interview talk show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian is actually participating in a talk show! And this show is in a live format!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked surprised. As far as she could remember, Brian had never participated in this type of program before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembers stumbling upon posts about him before, where someone commented that despite being a prince in the entertainment industry, he rarely shows up on shows, let alone interviews.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And now, this is...</p></div>
