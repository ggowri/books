        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Besides, with his family background, it was too easy for him to get a woman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you supposed to hate me? Why do you still want to..." Nancy asked hesitantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did he still have sex with her? Because he was extremely disgusted with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Touching the body of someone you despise...that can't possibly be a pleasant feeling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's not for you to ask," Mick said coldly. "Just tell me, do you want to or not?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Nancy said. "If that's what you want..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he intended to use sex as punishment for her, then she was willing to accept it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then strip!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That emotionless voice echoed in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy raised her hand and unbuttoned her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the same time, she was mentally preparing herself to be treated roughly by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps he wanted to use her body to vent his anger towards her, even if it left her bruised and battered, she wouldn't complain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But to her surprise, he was gentle.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she removed her clothes, he kissed her gently and caressed her body with his fingers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>All of his movements were so considerate, as if he wanted her to have a good experience.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of his actions even gave her the illusion that they were still in the best period of their </span><span>relationship, and he treated her like a precious treasure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she made eye contact with him, she knew that it was all just her own illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze was like a bottomless abyss, so cold that everything seemed like a mere innocent action without any other meaning attached to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt her heart sinking continuously at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though her body was getting hotter and hotter due to the affectionate relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her heart was filled with a sense of sadness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clearly, this man was the one she loved, and his actions were so gentle at this moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But...he no longer had any feelings for her, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What did this lovemaking mean to him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy didn't know when it ended, nor how many times he had taken her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She passed out halfway through.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she woke up again, it was already the next morning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Nancy moved her body, she felt like she was falling apart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was wearing a robe, and her body under the robe was dry.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Mick help her clean up?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Where was Mick?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy looked around the room but didn't see Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The sound of water came from the direction of the bathroom.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is he in the bathroom?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she thought about it, Nancy struggled to stand up and tried to pick up the clothes she wore yesterday from the floor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as her feet touched the ground, she almost fell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finally stabilizing herself, Nancy took a deep breath.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With this movement, every bone in her body seemed to be groaning, silently telling her what had happened last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she finally picked up the scattered clothes on the ground and was about to change when the bathroom door opened.</span></p></div>
