        <h1>Chapter 925</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will Daddy live with Mommy, Grandma, and me from now on?" Nelson asked with his childlike voice again, full of longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He saw in cartoons that family members lived together!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stared at his son. He was about to speak, but Kyla had already gone ahead and said, "Alright, Nelson, he... Daddy... has something to do and has to go now. Why don't we say goodbye to Daddy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It took her a lot of effort to utter the word &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Daddy's not going to stay with us today?" There was a hint of disappointment in the little one's voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This place is so small. It will be too crowded... if Daddy stays with us," said Kyla as she looked at Martin Weiss almost imploringly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only hoped Martin Weiss would stop speaking and not destroy the innocent child's world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned. The words he intended to say seemed stuck in his throat. Under her eyes, he had become somewhat speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I kidding myself? Why should I care about the look in her eyes?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;ve never owed her anything. She owes me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, despite this, Martin Weiss did not say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla quickly said, "Nelson, come and say goodbye to Daddy. It's getting late. You should go to bed now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little boy was obedient and waved to Martin Weiss. Then, he once again expressed his hope that his parents could live together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla only felt an indescribable bitterness when she heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Mrs. Corbyn took Nelson to the washroom to wash up, Kyla looked at the man in front of her and said, "Martin Weiss, no matter what happened to me and you, I hope you won't tell the child anything that will upset him or destroy his hopes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He'll know sooner or later. What difference will it make?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson doesn't matter to you at all, does he? Why do you want to disturb our peace? You said you wanted revenge. Alright, I&rsquo;ll let you take it out on me. Three and a half years in prison and a stab in the stomach aren't enough, so tell me, what will satisfy you? I can cut off my arm or leg," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she could keep Nelson, she would do whatever it took.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression gradually turned livid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, what makes you think cutting off your arms and legs would be enough? I won't let Nelson follow you anymore. I told you, I'll make sure you won't have the right to see him!" His cold voice escaped his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss!" She suddenly cried out his name, both her hands seized his arms. "Do you have to do that? Must you take Nelson away from me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glanced at her hand that was holding his arm before raising his hand to pull her fingers away from his arm, little by little. "Since you dared to give birth to my child, you should have been prepared for this! I can leave you alone when you're in Emerald City, but that doesn't mean I'll let my child stay with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at her empty hands as despair reappeared on her face. "Is it possible that after all I&rsquo;ve suffered, I still can&rsquo;t hold on to what I want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had lost her love and freedom. Was she going to lose her child now too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just wanted to raise her child and be with him as he grew up! Why was something so simple so hard for her?</p></div>
