        <h1>Chapter 3353</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Lawrence is no longer here, do you plan on giving up playing the piano? Maybe you can pick it up again, practice more, especially since Jasper enjoys listening to you play.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will set aside some time every day to practice, but I won't spend too much time on it," said William. "Dad, I want to give up the piano, and I'm serious. Because I know that no matter how hard I practice, I won't be able to achieve the special feeling that Jasper talked about being contained in the sound of the piano."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of his playing, it always gives the feeling of a mechanical performance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he only wants to use the piano to keep Jasper, then... he won't be able to keep her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time it can be Lawrence, next time it could be someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this world, there are too many talented pianists, and Jasper could fall in love with someone else's piano at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, he chose to give up playing the piano and instead used something he was more confident in to keep Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Daddy, I will be with Jasper in the future, for a long time, forever!" William said this with such conviction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Philip chuckled softly, "Then I'll wait to see the day when you fulfill that wish."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And as the plane took off, William watched Emerald City gradually shrink in his view, silently saying to himself - soon, they will grow up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he grows up... he will surely be able to stand by Jasper's side for real, and then, he won't have to worry about anyone taking her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time always passes by unnoticed, little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On Harley's third birthday, it was particularly lively. In addition to the big names in the film and television industry who came to congratulate, there were also a group of Emerald City celebrities who came. The scene was so grand that, in the words of the media, it was comparable to the golden age of the entertainment industry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley is also known as the little princess of the entertainment industry and has attracted a lot of attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Brian and Valda try their best to protect their daughter's privacy, the little princess's appearance is occasionally captured by some passersby and uploaded online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, many netizens have expressed that they would definitely watch if the little princess were to make a film.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some people online have expressed their desire for Brian to appear on some parent-child variety shows with his little princess, which would surely be very interesting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, at the three-year-old birthday party of the little princess, Harley, who is the main character, is wearing a light pink princess dress with a matching bow on her head. She is also wearing white leather shoes, looking quiet and beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, anyone who knows her well can tell that this is definitely a facade.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This little princess is quite mischievous. She is spoiled by everyone in the family, including her grandparents, mother, and father. As a result, Valda has become the one who sets rules for the little one and the only one who can discipline her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda only gave the little one two spanks when they did something wrong. The little one had teary eyes and said very decisively, "Mommy, I was wrong. I won't do it again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Admitting one's mistakes is very refreshing, but not learning from them refers to someone like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I have to say, tears are a very powerful thing, especially when they come from a daughter's beautiful eyes that resemble Brian's. Valda's heart softened instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Brian didn't interfere when Valda was educating their daughter, he always lovingly embraces her after her education is complete.</p></div>
