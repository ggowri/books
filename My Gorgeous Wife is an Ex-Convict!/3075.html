        <h1>Chapter 3073</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille tried to step forward to pull Brian's hand off the woman he was holding down, but Brian pushed her away and she fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It hurts!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille was silently grieving in her heart, but she was more worried about Brian's loss of control than her own pain at the moment. For Brian, the torn piece of cloth on his wrist that got stained today might have been like a fuse, igniting the emotions he had been suppressing for some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As things were getting out of hand and someone might get hurt, Camille urgently shouted, "Brian, don't do this. If Valda finds out that you caused harm for her sake, she won't be happy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Brian murmured, his phoenix eyes becoming even more crimson. "It's because I didn't take a life for her that she disappeared. If I had been more ruthless back then, maybe she would still be by my side now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had exterminated the Cross family back then, and if he hadn't saved Whitney, then as long as one of these two conditions had been met, Valda wouldn't have had any trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was him, he caused Valda's harm, his hesitation caused Valda's harm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille urgently said to Brian as he was about to get aggressive again, "Brian, Valda is still alive! She's back, she really is!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This sentence made Brian abruptly stop his movements, and then he slowly turned his whole body towards her, as if in slow motion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips trembled slightly, and after a while, he finally managed to squeeze out a few words, "She... has she come back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though it was just a few words, he spoke as if he had put all his strength into it. His voice trembled heavily, and his phoenix eyes were filled with both anticipation and fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It's as if he's afraid that what he heard just now was only his imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, she's back!" said Camille. "Valda is at my house right now, she's back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she really wanted to keep it a secret from Valda, there's no other choice now. If she doesn't speak up, Brian might actually cause harm to someone here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, Brian had already dashed out of the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman had fainted with a bloody face, and her friends and restaurant staff quickly gathered around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille breathed a sigh of relief and took out her phone, dialing Valda's number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how many times she dialed, there was never an answer on the other end of the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did Valda forget her phone?" Camille wondered to herself. She wasn't sure if Valda would blame her, but either way, Brian and Valda were going to meet today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only hopes that everything will be okay!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda went downstairs to take out the trash, which should have been a simple task. However, now it seemed much more difficult as she had to use her crutches and carry the garbage down the stairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda chuckled a bit. Camille's apartment was still in the old building without an elevator. Luckily, Camille's place was on the third floor. If it were on the seventh floor, it would have been even more difficult for her to take out the trash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back in the room, Valda glanced at her phone charging on the table. There were messages on it - three missed calls from Camille and a message she had sent online.</p></div>
