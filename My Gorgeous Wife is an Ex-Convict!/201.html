        <h1>Chapter 200</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll say I can&rsquo;t cure this illness and bring your mother home. I&rsquo;ll see if she&rsquo;ll contribute this money!&rdquo; Old Mr. Kelleigh said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But what if she really sues us?&rdquo; First Uncle said, worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Second Uncle hurriedly added, &ldquo;Yes, she was a top law student back then and had even been a lawyer. Moreover, backing her now&hellip;. That big figure is probably there. If they really sue us, we probably won&rsquo;t be able to win the lawsuit.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Mr. Kelleigh rubbed his chin. His expression was ugly as he said, &ldquo;Then you three sum up the remaining three quarters of the medical bill.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You want us to cover the expenses?&rdquo; Third Aunt hastily asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What else? Wait for that brat to sue us?&rdquo; Old Mr. Kelleigh glared angrily at his daughter. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t contribute to these medical expenses, don&rsquo;t think you can get a single penny from the coming expropriation compensation!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Third Aunt did not make a sound anymore. Although she was a daughter who had already married off, the family said before that they would give her a small sum from the expropriation compensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now the whole family had their hopes pinned on this expropriation compensation!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Grace really started a lawsuit, then maybe Grace could have a piece of this expropriation compensation pie too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The large family all looked at each other. Finally, they could only come to the decision to pool the money from the three families.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace returned to her grandmother&rsquo;s ward. Her grandmother had already fallen asleep, so Grace sat by the hospital bed and silently watched her grandmother&rsquo;s sleeping face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, the person who always protected her was her grandmother, but now she had gotten old and needed Grace&rsquo;s protection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Actually, if she really had the money, she would not mind paying all of her grandmother&rsquo;s medical expenses by herself, but the current her led a difficult life. She could not bear her grandmother&rsquo;s medical expenses all by herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today, she brought up the expropriation compensation, so she thought that her grandfather as well as First Uncle and the others would probably give her grandmother a good medical treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If there was not enough money for the medical expenses, she would do her best to fight for her grandmother&rsquo;s rights and use the expropriation compensation money later on to safeguard her grandmother&rsquo;s remaining life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, there was too little she could do for her grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After an unknown amount of time, the sky was gradually darkening. Grace only left the ward when the nurse walked in to check the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she walked out of the inpatient section, she inadvertently saw a figure walking out of the clinic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She never thought she would bump into Brian at a place like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, there was nobody else with Brian. It was just him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had clearly spotted Grace too. His eyes lit up slightly. Then, he walked over and said, &ldquo;What a coincidence.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It is a little coincidental,&rdquo; she said before going around him to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the next moment, he reached out a hand to stop her. &ldquo;Speaking of which, last time I treated you to a meal, I made you encounter some unpleasant things. How&rsquo;s this&hellip; I&rsquo;ll treat you to another meal today. Take it as an apology for the matter last time.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that Brian was talking about how she had met his ex-girlfriend, Emily Theller, when they ate together last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, she used to see news about Emily Theller often on media online, but in recent times, there had been absolutely no news about Emily Theller online. It was like there was no such person in showbiz.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;What happened to that ex-girlfriend of yours?&rdquo; Grace could not help asking, but she regretted it after the words left her mouth. This was not something she should be asking.</p></div>
