        <h1>Chapter 2463</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace continued saying, "How would your eldest brother feel if he knows that the woman he protected with his life was kneeling in front of his grave like this but couldn&rsquo;t even offer him incense?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss's expression turned ghastly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, he looked coldly at Amber Mitchell. "If you want to burn incense for my eldest brother, kowtow a hundred times in front of his grave! I want to see you do it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone around them looked startled as soon as he said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace slightly frowned, but Amber Mitchell finally smiled as if she had hope again. "Okay, I'll kowtow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she finished speaking, she kowtowed in front of the tombstone with loud thuds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sound of her actions was clear in the silent cemetery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was worried. Amber Mitchell had suffered so much in the mental hospital. She was already weak and had so many wounds, both old and new, on her body. If she kowtowed a hundred times, it would probably be detrimental to her health.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Moss, are you going to let her faint in the cemetery?" Grace asked as she turned to glare at Daley Moss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I only gave her a choice. She chose to make this decision. It has nothing to do with the rest!" Daley Moss said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But she..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Jason grabbed Grace and said, "It's Amber Mitchell's choice. She knows what she's doing. I know you want to help her, but she&rsquo;s doing it willingly. Perhaps she'll feel better by kowtowing like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze and pressed her lips together. In the end, she said nothing and just stood nearby. She waited quietly for Amber Mitchell to finish kowtowing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometime later, Amber Mitchell's forehead was bruised and bleeding. The blood left traces on the gray stone platform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell, you should stop now. Your body won&rsquo;t be able to take it if you keep on kowtowing." Grace could not help persuading.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera, who was standing next to Daley Moss, persuaded her husband. "Why don't you... let her offer him incense? She might get killed if she keeps kowtowing like this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Do you feel sorry for her?" Daley Moss asked as he looked at his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Herrera shook her head and kept silent. Although her husband loved her very much, she also knew that her husband's taboo was his eldest brother, who died early. As long as his brother was involved, his mood would be easily affected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said to Grace, "I can continue. I owe Herman so much. Even if I have to kowtow 10,000 times, I'm willing to do it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she continued to kowtow. She was seemingly unaffected by the pain in her forehead. It was as though not being able to kowtow was more painful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she finished kowtowing 100 times, Amber Mitchell's pale face was in stark contrast to the deep red color on her forehead. It looked so shocking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked weakly at Daley Moss and said hoarsely, "Can I... offer him some incense now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss seemed to have fallen into a trance as he remembered the time he asked his eldest brother why he loved Amber Mitchell!</p></div>
