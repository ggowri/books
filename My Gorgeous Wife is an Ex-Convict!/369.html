        <h1>Chapter 368</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;H-hello,&rdquo; Mr. and Mrs. Sweeney quickly responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Sweeney invited Hadwin to take a seat while Mrs. Sweeney pulled her daughter to the side. &ldquo;This is your boyfriend? He&rsquo;s not someone you hired to put up an act?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina rolled her eyes. &ldquo;You can just think of him as an actor I hired, then.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mrs. Sweeney was exasperated. &ldquo;What a child! How can you speak that way! Alright, go serve tea.&rdquo; With that said, Mrs. Sweeney then plastered a friendly face and walked over to Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Lina was the designated waitress, she headed to the kitchen to prepare some tea. When she stepped into the living room with a tray of tea, she saw the three people chatting joyfully with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Hadwin, you said that you got to know Lina while abroad, so have the both of you been keeping in touch all these years?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s after I returned to the country recently and bumped into Lina on the streets that we kept in contact. To be honest, I&rsquo;ve been searching for Lina all these years. Fortunately, I&rsquo;ve found her.&rdquo; Hadwin smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He shot a look at Lina as he said that. From Mr. and Mrs. Sweeney&rsquo;s view, that was a look filled with love. However, for Lina, it was a look filled with threats.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Sweeney smiled. &ldquo;Both of you are truly fated. However, since you guys first saw each other overseas, that would mean it was only within a span of a few days. How did you develop feelings for Lina?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Sweeney was curious to know. After all, his daughter only went abroad for a few days. How did she manage to make a man unable to forget about her for over three years within such a short time? Furthermore, that man was an attractive-looking man who could make girls swoon. It was not a problem for him to look for a girlfriend, yet he had been looking for his daughter for the past three years. This made Mr. Sweeney&rsquo;s impression of Hadwin increase exponentially.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Lina is a straightforward girl. I feel comfortable interacting with her. There was once when I was drunk...&rdquo; Hadwin said without any reservations. Lina suddenly shuddered, and the cup of tea in her hand spilled by half.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; She growled softly and immediately put the cup down. The back of her hand began to turn red from being scalded by the hot tea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin frowned, speedily pulled Lina up, made a dash for the kitchen, and turned on the cold water tap to allow the cold water to wash over her scalded hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you even hold a teacup properly?&rdquo; he said sulkily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t mention that I&rsquo;ve spent the night with you in the hotel back then. My parents are conservative people. If they find out about this, they&rsquo;ll break my canine legs,&rdquo; Lina urgently said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Canine legs?&rdquo; He side-eyed her. &ldquo;This is the first time I&rsquo;m hearing someone describe themselves as a canine.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina felt deflated. She admitted that she kind of used the wrong description.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Whatever it is, just don&rsquo;t breathe a word about it.&rdquo; There was begging in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He sealed his thin lips tightly, not saying a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;As long as you don&rsquo;t mention it, I can...&rdquo; She abruptly paused mid-sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&lsquo;What can I do? Buy him a meal? He doesn&rsquo;t seem like someone who will be interested in a meal that I can afford. Shall I give him a gift as a reward? I don&rsquo;t have the cheek to say that out when the person I&rsquo;m speaking to is richer than me by more than a thousand folds.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whichever idea that came to her mind did not seem appropriate at all. Thus, Lina&rsquo;s sentence was paused for a long time. There was no sign of continuation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; Hadwin bent forward slightly to look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at that handsome face that was merely inches away from her and her heart could not stop beating rapidly. Lina could not help but complain inwardly. &lsquo;Why does a man need such a good-looking face? Especially his skin&hellip; It&rsquo;s way better than mine.&rsquo; His skin was so good that she had the urge to ask him what skincare products he used.</p></div>
