        <h1>Chapter 2009</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina got so furious that she almost prepared to fight them with her pregnant belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace stopped her best friend and looked at Nelson Corbyn again. "Nelson, do you want to suffer this injustice and have your mommy suffer it with you? You're still a kid. You can't bear too much burden. But Aunt Lina and I can help you solve these problems.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla also spoke to her son with sign language, asking him to tell the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn finally told Grace in sign language that his classmates had bumped into him on purpose. After he fell, they snatched his hearing aid and wanted to crush it. He only fought to get his hearing aid back!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do they often do that to you?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why? Is there a reason?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn continued to speak in sign language. Grace's nose could not help feeling sore after understanding it. Kyla suddenly hugged her son while crying. "I'm sorry... I'm sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina, who did not know much sign language, could not understand what Nelson Corbyn had just said. She could only ask Grace anxiously, "What&rsquo;s Nelson saying? Why is Kyla crying like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said with a heavy voice, "Nelson said that the kids he fought with today often bully him in class. They say that his mother's an ex-convict and that he&rsquo;s disabled, so he doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be in the same classroom as them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's eyes widened as she listened. She did not expect third graders to... behave like this. She thought children this age should be simple, but now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Should Nelson be discriminated against because Kyla was falsely accused and sent to prison and because he could not hear?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Lina's phone rang. She answered the phone and heard Hadwin Stephenson's voice from the other end of the line. She immediately sobbed nasally, "Hadwin..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson, who was on the other end of the line, heard Lina crying and immediately asked, "Lina, what's the matter? What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Lina had no idea how to tell Hadwin Stephenson what had happened here, so Hadwin Stephenson only said, "Where are you now? I'll come over!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I'm at the discipline office in Nelson's school," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson knew about Nelson Corbyn's school. It was just next to Kyla's store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson hurriedly ended the call. After Lina ended the call, the married couple immediately said sarcastically, "What's the matter? Are you calling someone here? It doesn't matter if someone else comes. Speaking of which, disabled people should go to schools for disabled people. If the school accepts disabled students, others will probably wonder when it became a school for the disabled!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's face darkened. "Sir, please be polite. You're already suspected of discrimination by saying that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? I donate a lot of money to this school every year. Don't I have the right to think that some students aren't fit for this school?" the man said haughtily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The woman nearby also said to the teacher, "I don't want to see disabled students and my son in the same class. If you insist on letting this child attend your school, we will no longer donate to this school. I'm certain a lot of parents won't want their children in the same classroom as a disabled child."</p></div>
