        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" he could never forget that day when he saw Tina's pregnant mother, the connection suddenly exploded in his body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In that instant, he finally understood what the so-called connection passed down in the family's records really meant!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turns out that finding the person who can break the curse feels like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't until now that Tina finally understood why Chandler appeared suddenly when her mother was in difficult labor, and then saved her and her mother, and wanted to be engaged to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was all because of this curse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The so-called fate was because of this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, all these years, you have been by my side, to have a child with me in the future and break the curse on you?" Tina took a while before speaking again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at Tina, her face full of tears, and he knew that he could lie to her at this moment, maybe lying would be good for both of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But no matter how hard he </span><span>tried,</span><span> he couldn't bring himself to say the lie.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had promised her that he wouldn't hide anything and would be completely honest with her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At first, that was indeed my intention, but later..." he wanted to explain, but she quickly interrupted him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, it was all just a manipulation from the beginning?" Tina smiled bitterly, "Later? Are you </span><span>trying to say that later you developed genuine feelings for me? When was that? When I was in elementary school? Middle school? Or maybe high school?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But none of that matters now!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she looked at the old photo albums and videos of her and Chandler together, even though she didn't have the memories of the past, she could still feel the beauty in those images.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, those beautiful images are starting to change.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How much sincerity is mixed in with all of this? How much is driven by ulterior motives?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Faced with Tina's questioning, Chandler remains silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's heart becomes even more uneasy, sinking further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hopes he can </span><span>refute,</span><span> hopes he can tell her it's not like what she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his silence confirms, from the beginning, he used her, even if he did develop feelings for her much later.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And within this motive, how much does his affection for her really hold?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina wipes away the tears from her face, looking at Chandler with determination: "If I'm not the one who can break the curse, would you still love me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's hand, hanging by his side, clenches into a fist, his nails digging into his palm: "I don't know, because even before you were born, I knew about your existence, and then I stayed by your side, gradually falling in love with you. I don't know what it would be like between us if you weren't the one, but I've always..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I'm not the one, then maybe you wouldn't have given me a second glance, or by that time, both I and my mother would have already died and wouldn't even be in this world!" Tina mocks herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler wants to say something, he knows if he doesn't say anything, their relationship might end like this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he opens his mouth, nothing comes out!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I need to think about this thoroughly, it's already late today!" Tina says, walking out of the room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the room, Chandler is left alone.</span></p></div>
