        <h1>Chapter 1820</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? You seem worried. Are you worried about the baby?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How can I not be worried?&rdquo; Lina smiled bitterly. "My parents have also found out about the baby. They said I can make my own decisions. Hadwin Stephenson said he's willing to take responsibility and marry me. I've thought it through. Marrying him is the best way to go. Not only will it be the most graceful way, but the baby won't be a bastard child as well. People will only envy me for marrying a rich husband. No one will laugh at me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But you still can't make up your mind, can you?" asked Grace. After all, her best friend still looked worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Should I... get back together with Hadwin Stephenson?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What you should ask is whether you still love Hadwin Stephenson," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Do I still love him?' Lina pressed her lips together tightly. Maybe she would not be so upset if she did not love him. Maybe she could just lie on the operating table and have the abortion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although her best friend did not answer her, Grace could also guess the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I know Hadwin Stephenson hurt you very deeply in the past, so I'll have your back no matter what choice you make. But I also hope that once you make a decision, you&rsquo;ll ask yourself whether you&rsquo;ll regret it in the future," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He asked me to give him a week and said that he has something important to tell me. After counting the days, it&rsquo;s been almost a week but he hasn&rsquo;t come looking for me, let alone tell me anything important," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If he hasn&rsquo;t come to you, you can go and ask him. You used to like to make things clear and hated to drag things out," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, I used to be like that!" Lina chuckled and picked up the glass of water in front of her before drinking it all. "Okay, I&rsquo;ll go look for him later and ask him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at how resolute her best friend was at the moment, Grace thought the old Lina was back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After having something to eat, Lina decided to go look for Hadwin Stephenson. Grace asked, "Do you want me to take you there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks. I drove here!" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're still driving?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "I know what I'm doing. I'll stop driving when my belly gets bigger. You were pregnant with triplets then. I only have one baby, and there's nothing much to watch out for. When I went to the hospital for my pregnancy check-up, I saw a woman riding an electric scooter with a pretty obvious baby bump!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace had no idea whether to laugh or cry when she heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After saying goodbye to Grace, Lina drove to Hadwin Stephenson's mansion in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">During the last pregnancy check-up, she learned that he was now in Emerald City and had been staying in the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was familiar with the mansion, of course. She had even driven here countless times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at the time, it was almost eight at night. Hadwin Stephenson should have returned to the mansion by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wanted to meet Hadwin Stephenson and tell him she wanted to take a chance! She wanted to marry him... and get back together with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She wondered if she would regret the decision.</p></div>
