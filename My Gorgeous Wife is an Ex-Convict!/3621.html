        <h1>Chapter 3619</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean? Even if I want my dad to cover up this matter, it's my business!" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her. "Is this how much you want to protect William?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, of course I want to protect him!" she declared without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her attitude seemed to provoke him. "He's just the son of a criminal, and his mother caused so much harm to your mother. Yet you still want to protect him. Don't you find that ridiculous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's face hardened as she replied, "There's nothing ridiculous about it. The mistakes his mother made are her own, not his. To me, William is my most important friend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Friend?" he sneered. "Do you trust him that much? Aren't you afraid that he might have ulterior motives for getting close to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Stop slandering William!" Jasper said displeasedly, "If you continue to slander him, I won't be polite to you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger laughed even louder, "So, this is what you call slander? If you can be so sure that he approached you without any other motives, then why did he&mdash;"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice suddenly stopped and he didn't say anything more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper asked puzzledly, "What happened back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing, I just wanted to say that he was lucky back then. His mother almost ruined your whole family, but he was temporarily fostered by your family and found his biological father. And you can easily trust him. Tell me, what kind of spell did he cast on you?" he sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interactions between people are based on sincerity and trust!" Jasper said, "I trust William because I know he genuinely cares about me! Roger, when you say such things, does it mean that you have never sincerely treated anyone before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A dangerous glint flashed in his eyes as he tightened his grip on her wrist, "What makes you think that I have never sincerely treated anyone? You keep talking about interactions between people based on sincerity, but have you really treated everyone sincerely, Jasper?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated, looking at his face, and some words suddenly became hard to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face resembled the appearance Lawrence would have had when he grew up, just as she remembered!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them looked at each other, not knowing how much time had passed before he finally let go of her hand, "Now, William's grandparents are in a destitute situation. Regardless of whether William recognizes them or not, there will probably be a storm. If you still stand by William's side, then the Reed family might also get involved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper took a deep breath and said, "No matter if I get involved or not, I will stand by William's side!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her parents have already said that the Reed family will support her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, she wants to follow her heart and avoid doing things that she will regret easily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger looked deeply at Jasper, his thin lips coldly uttering three words, "It's up to you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he turned around and left, leaving Jasper alone, still standing in the same spot, rubbing her wrist that was hurt by him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's wrong with Roger? He seemed so angry at her, especially with that resentful expression on his face. It made Jasper feel like she owed him something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At one point, she even had the illusion that Roger was Lawrence!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But immediately, she told herself that it wasn't true!</span></p></div>
