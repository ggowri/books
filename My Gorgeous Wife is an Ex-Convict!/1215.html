        <h1>Chapter 1214</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Two million dollars. Lina's life! But I have no way to get the money for Lina! What will happen to Lina? Is the Sweeney family going to sell their house? What if they still don't have enough money after they sell the house? The ICU ward costs tens of thousands of dollars a day. How can ordinary folk afford long-term treatment?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's lips trembled as she tried to say something, but she did not know what else to say!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she had to negotiate with Jason was herself. However, she had become nothing to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her despair made his heart throb in pain again. Jason pressed his thin lips together tightly, disgusted that his heart once again ached for the woman who had dumped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After an unknown amount of time, Grace's voice once again rang in the office. "Can't you... lend me two million dollars?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suppressing the pain in his heart, he said coldly, "Haven't I made myself clear?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said bitterly, "It's... clear... Then... I&rsquo;m sorry for disturbing you..." She spoke with almost all of her strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Turning around, she walked step by step toward the office door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Lina... What will happen to Lina? How can I save Lina? Why am I so useless? Even today, I have no way to trade my life for Lina's.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only a short distance of seven or eight steps from her spot to the door, but she walked slowly with each step. It was as if all her strength was drained from her body. When she almost got to the door, she suddenly felt dizzy and her eyes plunged into darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her last thought was that she seemed to have fallen into a familiar embrace...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was distracted during his check-up at the hospital. The image of Grace stopping the car that morning kept flashing before his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked so pale and fragile, and her eyes... were at first pleading and hopeful, but later... turned to disappointment... and even despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What is she disappointed in? Why is she desperate?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because I don't want to settle Chase Harper's case in private?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she care about Chase Harper that much?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian shook his head, trying to take his mind off what had happened that morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's come over you, Brian?" Stella's voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled faintly. "Nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a twinkle in Stella's eyes. Even though there was a rift and a misunderstanding between Brian and Grace, he was still so cold to her that his reluctance was at its height.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's so good about Grace? Didn't she just study for a few more years and look slightly better than me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They looked similar back then, so they were often mistaken for twins. However, she and Grace gradually looked less and less alike. Besides, Grace had studied in tMason Swansonty, so their temperaments changed more and more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gradually, when people in town talked about Grace, they called her beautiful and talented, while she was the pathetic one by comparison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was even more jealous at the thought of it.</p></div>
