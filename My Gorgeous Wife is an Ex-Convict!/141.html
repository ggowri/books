        <h1>Chapter 140</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe kept trying to smear Grace with all her might.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason casually fiddled with Grace's fingers and said faintly, "What's wrong with wiping shoes for a street sweeper? Even if it was the mayor's daughter, she would still have to do it!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe was speechless. Obviously, she couldn't be compared to the mayor's daughter.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Miss Stevens, please hurry up. Mr. Reed doesn't have much patience." Terrence urged, "If runs out of patience, you won't just be wiping shoes."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe reluctantly bit her lips. However, no matter how unwilling she was, she could only walk towards Grace one step at a time. Then, she bent down and began to wipe her already cleaned shoes with a tissue.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace looked at Zoe with daze. She never thought that such a scene would happen. But, did Lina have to go through this as well?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that time, what would she be feeling?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace felt sorry for her good friend. At the same time, she also seemed to vaguely understand why Jason had called Zoe over and then made her enact this scene.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wanted to tell her that he could easily do whatever he wanted. Even those who were arrogant and despised her, as long as he commanded, they could only kneel down and obediently wipe her shoes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe worked for a while and said, "Mr. Reed, this should be enough, right?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason raised his lips into a smile. "Not yet. How can this be enough?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Terrence stepped forward and said to Zoe, "Miss Stevens, sorry if I offend you." Then, he calmly stepped on the back of her hand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe suddenly cried out in pain, "Mr... Mr. Reed, what are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"He's just doing what you had done to Lina that night. Did you not?" Jason asked back.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe, of course, had done this, so now she couldn't even reply.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Jason spoke to Grace in a gentle voice, "Sis, didn't you say Lina is very important to you? Then I will help you vent the anger for her, are you satisfied?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His appearance seemed to be pure as if he was simply trying to please her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he spoke, his hands were still playing with her left hand, pushing his fingers into hers, and then slowly clasping the back of her hand... then their fingers interlocked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace felt that her left hand was completely stiff in his grasp. It was burning hot, and she wanted to pull away.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, as if she had lost control of her own body, she couldn't move her hand at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had never seen Jason acting this way. He could do such a thing while talking and laughing. But maybe this was the real him. What she had seen in the past was just an act.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe felt a heart-wrenching pain on the back of her hand. If he continued to step on it like this, her hand might end up the same as her foot.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed, my... my hand is going to break. Mr. Reed, please...please let me go." Zoe was in so much pain that she was weeping for mercy. She had completely lost her usual composure.</p></div>
