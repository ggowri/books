        <h1>Chapter 955</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was too late. You Keer&rsquo;s hand was already on Grace's back and was about to push Grace to the side where there were a lot of old computer spare parts that the firm had replaced some time ago. If she bumped into these things, then they would all fall on her. She would probably suffer a serious injury if that happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A hand suddenly grabbed Grace's arm and pulled her backward. Then, You Keer was kicked to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The flurry of actions took place almost instantaneously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">You Keer hit the wall, and her back started to hurt like hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who kicked..." You Keer raised her head angrily. She was about to swear, but her pupils shrank and her voice seemed to be stuck in her throat when she saw who it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Isn't this&hellip; the crown prince?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh, why is the crown prince here? He's even... holding the homewrecker in his arms?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">You Keer was a little stunned and said almost subconsciously, "Young Master Gu, this woman is no good. She's just a homewrecker&mdash;" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, she was slapped in the face before she could finish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was her boyfriend Curtis Row who slapped her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row felt as if his life had shortened by several years today!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Gu, I'm sorry. She's just babbling nonsense. Please forgive her! I'm sorry for what happened to Miss Cummins today. I'll make amends to Miss Cummins later!" said Curtis Row as he bowed repeatedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Make amends? Can you afford it?" Brian asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Curtis Row was dripping with cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">You Keer was dumbfounded. 'What's... going on here?' She had to be a fool to see that things were not quite what she first thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The homewrecker did not seem to be hooking up with Curtis Row.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the contrary, she seemed close to the crown prince.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at the figure in his arms, Brian asked, "Are you alright?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm alright. Thanks," Grace said politely as she pushed Brian away and took two steps back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His arms felt empty all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a frown on his face, Brian found her indifference and distance especially harsh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned and looked at Curtis Row. "Mr. Yu, please take your girlfriend and leave! Also, I reserve the right to sue your girlfriend for the insults she directed at me today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, sure! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!" Curtis Row apologized repeatedly. Then, he rudely dragged You Keer to leave the firm quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not only did he fail to make amends, but he also added new trouble to his list!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for You Keer, she was still confused about the entire thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned around and was about to explain to Lawyer Carter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it would leave a bad impression when such a thing happened at the firm&hellip; Even if she was not the one at fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was about to pass Brian, he grabbed her wrist and turned to Lawyer Carter who was nearest to them. He said, "Give me a room. I want to talk to her alone."</p></div>
