        <h1>Chapter 893</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then&hellip; Then don't they know that we... Gosh!" whined Lina. 'My parents are the most conservative type of people. If they know that someone has had their way with me&hellip; Uh, no... That I had my way with someone, would they punish me by making me kneel on the washboard after I go home?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it embarrassing to sleep with me?" His expression sank. She looked as if he was a mortifying secret that she needed to keep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, no! There's nothing more honorable than to sleep with you! I'm just afraid that my parents won't accept it because they're conservative," Lina said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin only felt that every time he was about to be pissed off, this woman would then amuse him. "All I told your parents was that you had a few drinks and slept in the guest room I arranged for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Whew!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, get dressed and go down for breakfast. Have some soup for your hangover. It'll make you feel better," he said. She never had the chance to drink the soup the servant prepared last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay!" replied Lina. She then watched Hadwin get out of bed and give her a set of new clothes before taking his clothes out of the closet and putting them on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina kept staring at Hadwin. She only found the image of him putting on his clothes supremely pleasing to the eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's a pity that... I have no memory of last night!' She was again mourning her drunken stupor of the night before. Otherwise, she could have had more &lsquo;pleasant&rsquo; memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Why are you looking at me like that?" asked Hadwin as he looked at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a mixture of admiration and regret in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... Nothing." Then, she started putting on her clothes. She picked them up and looked at the label. 'It's a luxury brand. This set of clothes cost more than my annual income!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But... Um, they're clothes from my boyfriend, so I'll still wear them!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina washed up and followed Hadwin downstairs for breakfast. After breakfast, she drank the soup for her hangover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the soup tasted pretty bad. Lina did not want to drink it, but Hadwin coaxed her until she finished it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin then drove his car and sent Lina to the design firm. "Don't go to such places again, got it?" he said as she stepped out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Got it," replied Lina. She only took Grace there out of curiosity because she saw someone mention it online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she entered the firm, she quickly sent her best friend a WeChat message.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">[How were you yesterday? I heard from Hadwin that Jason took you out of the bar.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did a double take after receiving the message from Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was in her bed when she woke up this morning. Everything in the rental house was as usual. However, there was a box of hangover pills on the bedside table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought it was Lina who had sent her back to the rental house, but it turned out to be... him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace: [Nothing. I didn't see him when I woke up this morning. What about you? What happened to you yesterday?] </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was in a daze about what happened last night. All she remembered was the atmosphere hyping up, and before she and Lina knew it, they had already drunk too much. Then, she and Lina sang and danced together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt as if she could vent out all the bitterness pent up in her heart, so she became more and more relaxed, hoping to release all her anguish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she could only relax in this way.</p></div>
