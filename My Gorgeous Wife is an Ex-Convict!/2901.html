        <h1>Chapter 2899</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two assistants left the studio after work, but Valda Theller remained hunched over her work table, continuing to draw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A faint pain in her stomach made her feel uncomfortable. Valda Theller stood up, made herself a cup of hot tea, and continued working.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, only work could make her forget the various troubles of reality and immerse herself in the beauty of drawing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She worked until her stomach growled, and then she looked up again. It was already after 8 pm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller then tidied up her things, picked up her bag, and left the studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she entered the elevator, she furrowed her brow slightly. Her stomach seemed to be hurting again. Could it be that she was going to have diarrhea?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She placed her hand on her stomach and gently rubbed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she walked towards the nearby subway station, she did not notice that there were a pair of eyes staring at her from a distance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon entering the subway station, Valda Theller went to the ticket machine to buy a ticket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her stomach seemed to be hurting more. Her left hand covered her abdomen, and her body instinctively bent over. Her right hand touched the screen to select her destination, and then she planned to take out her phone to pay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she took out her phone from her bag, the pain caused her hand to tremble, and the phone fell from her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" she exclaimed, but the phone did not fall to the ground. Instead, a beautiful hand caught it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Brian Hart's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even without looking up at his face, Valda Theller could recognize him just by his hand. After all, she had drawn his hand many times and was very familiar with the shape of his fingers and bones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The hand handed the phone to her. "What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?" His worried voice sounded in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you..." she replied with some difficulty, taking back her phone. She was about to use the scan code to pay for the subway ticket, but he had already grabbed her arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't take the subway. I'll drive you home. My car is parked outside."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No...it's okay. The subway is very convenient, and it's not crowded..." she said, trying to break free from his grip. However, her body seemed to have no strength, and her stomach was getting more and more painful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You really don't look good right now. I'll take you home!" he insisted. "Don't be stubborn. Even if you really want to break up with me and draw a clear line, don't let your body suffer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I really don't..." Before she could finish her sentence, a sudden stabbing pain in her abdomen made her cry out in pain.</p></div>
