        <h1>Chapter 2731</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian and I met in an accident when we were kids. We were separated for many years before running into each other again when I was 28 years old. But this is all in the past. You're his girlfriend now. This is also the first time in years that I've heard him introduce his girlfriend so seriously. We're only friends now. I hope you won't misunderstand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said honestly, not wanting her to have any misunderstandings because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "I know. Don't worry. I won't misunderstand. Everyone has a past. I... have a past too, but we'll get over our pasts in the end. What matters the most is the present and future! I consider myself lucky to know Brian. Besides, he's so nice to me. Sometimes, I feel like Cinderella."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was not lying. It was the truth. At least she felt that way. However, she knew that Cinderella would end up marrying the prince.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A Cinderella like her would only return to her original status when everything ended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two continued chatting. Valda Theller talked about her job, while Grace talked about her three little children at home and the baby in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked envious. "You'll have four children after giving birth to this baby. How nice to be surrounded by kids every day. But it must be tiring too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright. After all, I have nannies and servants helping me," Grace said as she raised her hand to gently stroke her bulging belly. "Speaking of which, I didn't think I would get pregnant again. This baby is kind of a surprise."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I envy moms like you. I wonder when I'll become a mom." Valda Theller lamented. She lost her parents when she was young and had been dependent on others. Therefore, she wished to have a real family again from an early age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted a husband who loved her and an adorable baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had thought Raymond Bowman was the one, but he disappointed her in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe you'll become one soon," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled. "Yeah, maybe soon." However, she knew she was lying right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Jason looked at Brian and said, "Is Valda Theller really your girlfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Could she be fake?" Brian asked in reply as if he was amused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know full well whether she's real or not," said Jason. There were things he had seen through but would not expose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stopped what he was doing and looked at the person in front of him. "Valda Theller is my girlfriend, and I&rsquo;ll transfer my feelings for Grace to her. You should be happy to see that, shouldn't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyes flickered. "I'd love to see that happen, of course. But are you sure that this woman can be your girlfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She already is!" Brian answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though it was just an accident at the beginning, he now thought she was the most suitable candidate after getting to know her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they returned to their seats, Grace and Valda Theller were talking and laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason carefully set down the food for Grace. His gentleness surprised Valda Theller. The netizens said Emerald City's Young master Reed was temperamental and ruthless, but he was so gentle to the person he loved that people knew how much he loved his wife at a glance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that no matter how high and mighty a person was, they would become gentle when facing the one they loved.</p></div>
