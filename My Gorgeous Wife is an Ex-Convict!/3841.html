        <h1>Chapter 3839</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I owe you, first because back then, I heard your piano playing and found you, and kept you by my side. To me, my words changed the fate of your family, so I often think, if I hadn't insisted on finding you, your family's life wouldn't have changed, and your mother might not have developed a gambling addiction."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper murmured, confessing his guilt to Lawrence word by word, "Secondly, I didn't listen to your explanation and broke off our friendship. Thirdly, you called me at the most dangerous time, but I didn't answer. These twists of fate are my guilt towards you, but this guilt is only mine, the Reed family doesn't owe you, nor does your family, you better remember that!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence stared at Jasper fiercely, her words were like digging up the bloody truth that had been buried under his revenge.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, he also understood that the ones to blame for his parents' death were his mother's gambling addiction and his father's indulgence, and those loan sharks who charged high interest rates!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But...his parents were already dead, and those loan sharks who harmed his parents had been arrested and were receiving the punishment they deserved.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the anger and resentment in his heart still couldn't be quelled!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like needing a release valve to vent, in order to let out the anger that had been suppressed in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Reed family was his release valve, allowing him to vent the anger that had been squeezed in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since you also said that you owe me, how do you plan to make up for these three debts of guilt?" Lawrence suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The guilt I owe you, I've made up for what I could over the years, and for what I can't make up for, I don't think I can do anything about it," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No way to make it up? You don't even ask how to make it up, how can you say there's no way?" Lawrence sneered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether you want to take my life or leave me disabled to seek revenge, I won't agree," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you right here, right now?" Lawrence said. "You know, this is a chemistry lab, everything inside is dangerous. It's easy to cause an explosion here."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't," Jasper said firmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What makes you so sure?" Lawrence asked coldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there really is an explosion here, neither of us can escape. Besides, if your goal is to kill me so easily, you had the chance before, didn't you?" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence pursed his thin lips. Yes, he had many chances before to kill her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But strangely, he never had that thought.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thought of letting her die never crossed his mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought of making the Reed family suffer, making them pay for his parents' death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he never thought of Jasper that way.</span></p></div>
