        <h1>Chapter 3359</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell frowned and let out a cold hum before leaving with the children. Nearby, the bodyguards who had come with the children also left with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Next, each mother checked their own child's wound and provided necessary education.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace and Jason are probably the busiest, as all four of their children were involved in the fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, the youngest Jasmine only acted as a messenger and did not actually join the "battlefield".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, according to Jasmine, she had originally called for backup and wanted to join the fight, but her sister held her back. Her sister said that if she participated in the fight, she would be a hindrance and they would have to divide their attention to protect her, which was not worth it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought about it and found it reasonable, so she didn't participate and instead cheered on the sidelines, waving her flag and shouting words of encouragement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace, upon hearing this, couldn't help but feel a mix of amusement and frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the youngest daughter didn't rush in to fight, which was a relief for her. After all, Jasmine has always been physically weak, and who knows what the outcome would have been if she had actually joined the fight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Among the children, Mick was the most seriously injured, while William wasn't doing much better. On the other hand, Mason and Jasper were less severely injured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was only slightly injured, thanks to William's protection.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason was lightly injured because he is very agile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace was surprised to see Mason joining in the fight, and when she asked her second son why, he simply replied, "Jasmine asked me to help."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace suddenly felt a warmth in her heart. Although Mason is now very aloof towards Grace, he is gradually accepting his family little by little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps as Jason said, Mason's situation will gradually improve with age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, although Mason joined the fight, he was not able to completely suppress the other side. This only shows that among those children, there are also some who are skilled in fighting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper, you should thank William properly. If he hadn't protected you today, you could have been hurt!" Grace said to her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I got it. Not only do I have to thank William, but I also have to thank my two brothers!" Jasper said, sticking out his tongue and adding, "But today, it was my first time getting into such a big fight!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To speak of it, it's quite fresh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, usually just mentioning the name of the Reed family is enough to deter people from laying a hand on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today is also considered as a life experience!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace let out a tired sigh and said, "Today, I finally understand how it feels to be a mother when your child gets into a fight with others."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, having more children means the amount of worry and concern for them also increases exponentially!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other hand, Harley was still lamenting her amusement park.</p></div>
