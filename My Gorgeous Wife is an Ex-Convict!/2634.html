        <h1>Chapter 2632</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She picked up a pencil and began drawing carefully. From time to time, Brian would look at the woman holding a pencil and drawing him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expression on her face looked the same, or rather she was more focused than when she had drawn him in the comic cafe that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said he gave people the urge to draw him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the first time someone had said that to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He still found it a little impulsive every time he recalled asking her to pretend to be his girlfriend. After all, they did not know each other. They were only strangers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... he did not seem to regret it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she &lsquo;wanted&rsquo; was more obvious than those women who had funny ideas against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, spending time with her did not tire him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe they should get familiar with each other first. Then, he would wait for the right time to show up in front of Grace with Valda and tell Grace that he had gotten over his feelings for her. Grace would then feel at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as Valda Theller could finish her mission, he could pay her well enough for her to live a comfortable life in the future when they ended their relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller had no idea how long she had been drawing. The more she drew, the more she wanted to put some more details into it. Especially those phoenix eyes that seemed to contain a complex glimmer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to include that complexity in her drawing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda Theller finished the last stroke, she realized that her stomach was already growling. She looked at the time and found that more than two hours had passed. She had taken a far longer time than she expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah... Sorry. I took too much time." She apologized quickly and said, "Are your hands and feet numb? Why don't I massage them for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said and instinctively stepped forward to massage his arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, maintaining a sitting posture for a long time would easily give the body poor blood circulation. There would be numbness in parts of his limbs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want to give me a massage?" he asked indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, I have good skills," she said quickly. Sometimes, people who sat for long periods like them tended to get sore. Hence, she and her assistants would massage each other's arms and necks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his eyebrows slightly, and she instantly realized what she had just said sounded misleading!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I... I'm not trying to take advantage of you. I'm just scared that your hands and feet have gone numb, so I want to help you get rid of the numbness. When I'm at my studio, my assistants and I would massage each other's arms, shoulders, necks, and so on..." Her face reddened as she explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her reddened face and could not help smiling slightly. "Alright, I didn't misunderstand. My hands and feet aren&rsquo;t that numb. They're back to normal now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That... That's good," she stuttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He went up to her easel and looked at the portrait she had drawn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The portrait was much more delicate than the one she drew at the comic cafe, which showed that her drawing skills were quite good. It was a realistic sketch. One could say that it resembled him very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially his eyes. There seemed to be so much going on in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was that how she saw him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rumble! The sound of stomach rumbling rang in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned to look at Valda Theller, whose face was full of embarrassment.</p></div>
