        <h1>Chapter 3348</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was different, he was always in the darkness, but because of her, he slowly started to become brighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, there were some things in his nature that he couldn't get rid of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He just didn't want to show his dark side in front of her. He could behave the way she expected him to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..." Grace seemed to want to say something else, but Jason hugged her and said, "Okay, Mason is only 10 years old now, and his feelings for Veronica should only be attachment. As for whether he will fall in love with her in the future and what Veronica will do, even if we think about it now, we can't do anything. Maybe in the future, things will not develop as we expected. What we can do now is to wait and see."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And when the time really comes to take action, then they will take action.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace had to give up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Mason's matter couldn't be concluded in a short time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Veronica was lying in bed in the Barlow family, preparing to go to sleep, suddenly, the door was knocked twice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hesitated for a moment, knowing who was outside the door at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Usually, at this point, she would shout or directly open the door, but...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica hesitated, her body didn't move, and she didn't make a sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time passed by second by second, the room was quiet, and after the two knocks on the door, there was no other sound outside the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After about 10 minutes, Veronica finally stood up, walked to the door, and opened it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A figure was standing outside the room, and those clear eyes were looking straight at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was shocked, "You...why are you still here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm waiting for you to open the door, sis." Mason replied as if it was a matter of course.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But...but I didn't come to the door, you should have gone back to your own room." Veronica said awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you're here to open the door now, aren't you?" He asked strangely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if I never opened the door?" She asked back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll just wait here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You'll only be waiting until morning!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, then I'll wait until morning," he said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To him, it didn't matter how long he had to wait outside the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was helpless seeing Mason like this, so she could only say to him, "Then... why don't you come in first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason obediently followed Veronica into the room, then automatically climbed onto the bed, pulled back the covers, and lay down on her bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was his usual position for lying down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't like sleeping alone at night, and always liked to go into her room and sleep next to her. It made him feel comfortable and satisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um... this is the last time," Veronica said as she got into bed and spoke to Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The last time?" His eyes flashed with confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right, this is the last time. We won't continue sleeping together like this in the future," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's pretty little face suddenly sank as he asked Veronica, "Why is it the last time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We have grown up, you are a boy and I am a girl, we cannot continue sleeping together," said Veronica.</p></div>
