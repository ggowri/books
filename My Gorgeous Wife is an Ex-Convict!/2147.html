        <h1>Chapter 2145</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After leaving the hospital, Martin Weiss said, "Are you still determined to have this baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes. If it comes to the point where I can't take it, I can only blame my and the baby's fate. It just means I&rsquo;m not fated to be the baby's mother," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But do you think your liver will be unaffected if it does come to that? You don&rsquo;t know how bad the damage will be!&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm mentally prepared for that," said Kyla as she looked down at her belly. "I&rsquo;ll fight for this baby!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he could not do it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't you know how to cherish yourself?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "I will cherish myself, and I know what I want. You heard what the doctor said today. It's not totally impossible to keep the baby. Though the risk for the mother is high, I&rsquo;ll be fine for the first seven months. And when the baby is seven months old, the chances of survival are very high. Medical technology is now advanced, unlike before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss was silent. His thin lips were almost pressed into a straight line. "In other words, there's no way you're going to terminate your pregnancy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes." She gave him an affirmative answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said nothing more and got into the car with Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He drove his car away from the hospital. Perhaps Kyla was a little exhausted. She could not help taking a nap as soon as she got into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss glanced at the sleeping Kyla out the corners of his eyes, and his eyes glimmered a little...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla had no idea how long she slept for but she found that the car was still driving on the road when she suddenly opened her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla rubbed her eyes. "How long have I been sleeping..." However, before she could finish speaking, she found that the road in front of her was unfamiliar. It was not the way to the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, where are you taking me?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he only said, "We'll be there soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla frowned. Then, she saw a private hospital slowly coming into view.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His car stopped at the private hospital&rsquo;s entrance. Several doctors in white coats and men in suits came over. "Mr. Weiss, everything's ready."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said to Kyla, "Okay. Come on, We'll do some tests here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla somehow felt an intense uneasiness, especially when Martin Weiss's face was so icy. When he was speaking just now, he had deliberately avoided her eyes, making the unease in her heart grow stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "I've done all the necessary tests at Municipal Women's Hospital. There's nothing else to do. Martin Weiss, I want to go home!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he insisted and said, "You must do the tests!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's unnecessary. If you're not going to take me home, then I can go home myself," she said and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He suddenly grabbed her arm. "Kyla, you must do the tests!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She felt a sudden sense of horror. Then, she stared at him in disbelief as if realizing something. "Are you... Are you going to abort the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Embarrassment flashed across Martin Weiss's face, but he did not deny it. "Yes, the existence of this child will only wear you down and threaten your health. The baby is like a time bomb buried in your body. I can't allow this bomb to continue existing."</p></div>
