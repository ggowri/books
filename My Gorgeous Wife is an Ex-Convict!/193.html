        <h1>Chapter 192</h1>
        <div><p>“Didn’t I used to stay here too in the past? Every night, didn’t we sleep in the same house?” he said calmly.</p><p>These words sounded… so misleading!</p><p>Grace bit her lip. “But now…”</p><p>“What about now?” he asked.</p><p>“There’s no spare bedding here. I still have yours from before, but I’ve never washed or hung them. Even if I take those out, I think they’ll have a smell.”</p><p>“There’s a very simple solution to this.” After Jason said this, he took out his phone and made a few orders into it.</p><p>In just a moment, knocks sounded on the door.</p><p>Grace went to open the door and saw Terrence as well as a few of Jason’s bodyguards she had met at the hospital before. They were holding blankets, bedsheets, and pillows this time as they walked straight in.</p><p>Each person who entered even said, “Ms. <span style="color:#000000"><span style="font-size:13px"><span style="background-color:#ffffff">Cummins</span></span></span>, sorry for bothering you.”</p><p>Every single person would come up and say this.</p><p>The corners of Grace’s mouth twitched. At this moment, what could she say? It seemed all she could say was just “It’s okay”.</p><p>When everything was arranged properly in her room, they went out one after another.</p><p>In just a moment, only the two of them were left in the room once again.</p><p>Grace looked at the bed that was already made up on the floor beneath hers. This… was just like back then. Back then, he had also made his bed beside hers.</p><p>“You truly want to sleep here?” she asked, hesitating.</p><p>“Of course,” he retorted, finding it laughable.</p><p>Or could it be that what was happening now was just a game to him? He already had a comfortable place to rest, but he wanted to squeeze into this rental home of hers.</p><p>Was it because he wanted to continue experiencing poverty for a while more?</p><p>Meanwhile, she… could only accept it.</p><p>Grace lowered her eyes and did not say anything else. She just grabbed the clothes she was going to change into, planning to head into the bathroom.</p><p>Suddenly, two arms wrapped around her from behind. “Just tonight. I only want to spend one night here. Today is her birthday.”</p><p>Grace stilled. “Who?”</p><p>He did not answer. He just buried his head deep into her shoulders, using a mumbling and close to pleading tone to say, “Tonight, let me stay. We’ll be just like before, okay, Sis?”</p><p>Her heart shook. He was Jason, but he was talking to her in Jay’s tone. </p><p>“Sis, okay?” His voice rang out again.</p><p>She hesitated, then asked in the end, “Just one night?”</p><p>“Uh-huh. Just one night,” he said.</p><p>“Then… Okay.” One night… Just one night.</p><p>She would just take it as thanking him for rescuing her from the Millers house and even taking her to the hospital for treatment. If he had not appeared then, she would just be another circumstance now.</p><p>Only then did Jason let his hands fall.</p><p>Grace walked into the bathroom and closed the door, staring at herself in the mirror.</p><p>Although she looked as dainty as usual, compared to a few years ago, she had gotten thinner. Her jaw looked even sharper.</p></div>
