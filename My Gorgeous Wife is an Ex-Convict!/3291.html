        <h1>Chapter 3289</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they returned to the villa, Valda finished taking a shower before receiving a call from Lina. "Hey dear, you met Kering today, right? For the movie premiere, can you bring me along? I'm free that day!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina's voice exudes immense passion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda paused for a moment, then seemed to realize something and asked, "Did it trend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Smart!" Lina exclaimed. "You and your husband had an encounter with Kering and the production team on the street, and now it's already trending at 17th place. I bet it will climb even higher in a little while. We have such a good relationship, you wouldn't leave me out of the premiere, would you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course not," Valda smiled. "I was actually planning to ask you guys if you're free to come along. If Kering doesn't provide enough tickets, I can ask Brian to figure something out and bring more people in."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I knew it, you're a loyal friend! Wow, we should be able to see Kering that day too. I never thought that a while ago we were talking about going to the film and television city to watch him film, but now we're going to his movie premiere. We should ask for his autograph, take a photo with him, and even shake his hand. I wonder if we can give him a hug..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina's voice became increasingly excited. Then, a man's voice came from the phone, "A handshake isn't enough, do you want to hug too? The actor is only 22 years old."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, he's quite young, with a promising future. Who knows, in a few years, he might even become a movie king. Then I'll be a woman who has hugged a movie king."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh? So you really want to hug the future movie star? Didn't you promise me before that you would stop being a crazy fan and control yourself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um, it was just a pure hug as a fan to an idol," Lina quickly clarified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then tell me, what does an impure embrace look like?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Hadwin finished speaking, a muffled voice came from the other end of the phone, "Um... Hadwin, don't... I... my phone is still... on the call..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Continuing on, the other party ended the call and a dial tone came through the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at her phone and thought of certain things, causing her face to blush momentarily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" Brian walked over and looked at his wife's flushed cheeks, then glanced at the phone she was holding. "Whose call is it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lina called to talk about going to the Kering movie premiere, but it seems like Hadwin doesn't want her to hug Kering when they meet, so they had a bit of an argument."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When it comes to the word "argument", Valda's face becomes even redder. After all, anyone who knows about relationships can hear the "argument" process from their voices to some extent.</p></div>
