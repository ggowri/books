        <h1>Chapter 3009</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, I actually have a little bit of..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But before he could finish his sentence, her finger was already on his lips, stopping him from continuing. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, I don't want you to say things that aren't true because of feelings of guilt or anything like that," Valda said. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, he felt embarrassed, and her clear eyes seemed to see right through him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Many people say that white lies are good, and maybe they are good for some people, but for me, I would rather know the harsh reality than a well-intentioned lie. After all, in my opinion, a lie used to weave a temporary beauty will eventually be exposed. The so-called eternal lie simply does not exist." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He felt the finger on his lips burning hot. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, I also hope that you promise me that you will never lie to me in the future, no matter what happens," Valda looked at him seriously and said, "Even if the truth is painful, don't lie to me. I don't want to be someone who lives in a lie without knowing it." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He met her gaze and gently pulled her hand down, holding it firmly in his palm. "Okay, I promise you that I will never lie to you in the future, no matter what happens." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda smiled lightly at his words, then wrapped her arms around Brian's waist and buried her face in his chest. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, I'm not as fragile as you think. Although you haven't fallen in love with me yet, which makes me a little regretful, I've actually thought about it for a long time," Valda said. Holding her like this, feeling his warmth, made her slowly reveal her innermost thoughts to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Actually, when I think about it, if you can fall in love with me so easily, then what do your previous relationships even mean? I don't know how long I will wait, five years, ten years? Maybe twenty years, thirty years. I even feel like I'm willing to wait until I'm old and gray...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words made his heart tremble, and he hugged her tightly, "No, you won't have to wait that long!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, then don't make me wait too long. I'm afraid that by the time you come, I'll be so old that I'll have lost my teeth and it will be even harder for you to fall in love with me," she joked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't change my love for you, even if you grow old and lose your teeth," Brian said hoarsely, with a hint of emotion in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really, Valda, this is not a lie," he said. Yes, it's not a lie, but his truest feeling in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He will definitely fall in love with her, no matter how long it takes, he will fall in love!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That night, when they went to bed, Brian held Valda's hand tightly as if he was holding a precious treasure that he had finally found. He was afraid that if he let go, she would disappear from his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next morning, when Valda greeted him with her usual smile and they had breakfast together, Brian felt a bit dazed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was right beside him, just like usual, but for some reason, his heart felt a little uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little princess on the Reed family's side, who was born prematurely, is finally going to have a banquet for her - a belated full moon banquet - now that she is over three months old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, the Reed family also invited many celebrities from Emerald City, and receiving an invitation from them was considered an honor by many.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda and Brian, of course, received the invitation without any surprises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at the invitation and remembered that Grace had mentioned the party when they met before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because there have been rumors circulating about her poor health and the baby's life being in danger, the Reed family went out of their way to make this banquet more grandiose. They also wanted outsiders to know that the Reed family's mistress and the newly born princess are doing well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda is a bit worried when she thinks about the grand banquet. She's afraid that if she attends the banquet with Brian, she might embarrass him.</p></div>
