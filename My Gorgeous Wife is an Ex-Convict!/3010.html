        <h1>Chapter 3008</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knows that the smile she wears now takes a great deal of effort to maintain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just wanted to quickly move past this topic, but he kept bringing it up repeatedly, leaving her feeling powerless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">My nose is becoming more and more sour, and tears seem to be uncontrollably welling up in my eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Valda said urgently, "Sorry, I... I want to go wash my face." Without waiting for him to say anything, she hurriedly ran towards the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bathroom door slammed shut, separating the two people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the bathroom, Valda stared blankly at her reflection in the sink mirror. At this moment, tears finally welled up in her eyes and flowed down her cheeks uncontrollably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What's wrong with her? She clearly knew from the beginning that Brian loves Grace. Why is she crying now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Didn't she prepare herself for a long-term struggle from the beginning?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now, just his silence alone almost made her give up completely, as if all her defenses had been shattered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, you need to be stronger. You chose this path yourself, so there's nothing to regret!" She said to herself in the mirror.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Making Brian fall in love with oneself was already a difficult task, and now it's just the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, we just hope for bigger things, which is why we end up feeling even more disappointed when they don't happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just pretend that Mr. Yeats never said these words. After all, judging whether someone truly loves another person just by looking into their eyes may be a bit hasty and arbitrary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda took a deep breath and turned on the faucet, splashing her face with the cold water to wash away her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side, Brian stood still, with Valda's teary eyes and almost crying expression still fresh in his mind. However, he noticed that she was trying hard to force a smile, as if she didn't care about what had just happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was him...who made her sad again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was clearly looking forward to hearing him say he loved her, so why didn't he say it just now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even her request was just "a little bit".</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he just says that he has fallen a little bit in love with her, then she must be incredibly happy, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Brian feels almost overwhelmed by guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, the bathroom door was pushed open and Valda walked out from inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian quickly walked up to her and noticed that her eyes were red and swollen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must have just cried!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's heart was once again gripped by pain.</p></div>
