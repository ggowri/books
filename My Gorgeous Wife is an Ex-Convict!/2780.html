        <h1>Chapter 2778</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's expression changed. Most of the classmates she saw in the private room were those who had insulted, beaten, and laughed at her in university.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These people were on good terms with Barbara Schuman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These people were her nightmare from her university days. She paled and trembled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland, who was holding Valda Theller's arm, naturally noticed the change in her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She lunged forward in front of Valda Theller to help isolate those scornful and mocking eyes. "We're not here for the class reunion. Don't flatter yourselves!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, they're different now. Didn't Valda Theller become a comic artist? She even has a comic-adapted drama in production! If that becomes a hit, Valda Theller is going to become popular! Why would she care for such a reunion?" someone said bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does she want to become popular? If she becomes popular, people might look into the shameless things she did back in university," someone mocked instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Another even said sarcastically, "Hmph, does she think she's a big deal to have drawn several comics and have a comic-adapted drama? She's still what she was back then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller bit her lower lip and did not defend herself because she knew any amount of explanation was pointless in front of these people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had tried defending herself in university, but what she got in return was more severe treatment from these people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her explanation was no more than a joke to these people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland saw her best friend's face getting paler and dragged her away to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, several attendees of the class reunion blocked their way, refusing to let them leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you in such a hurry to leave? Since you're here, why don't you drink as an apology to Yanqing? If it hadn't been for you, Yanqing and Raymond Bowman would&rsquo;ve been a couple by now. Your meddling caused the misunderstanding between Yanqing and Raymond Bowman. You made Raymond Bowman go abroad," someone said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Another person suggested, "Yeah, Valda Theller should apologize to Yanqing. Why don't we let her kneel and drink to make amends today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The others heckled at that, saying, "Okay, okay. Let's do it. Let her kneel and drink to apologize!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland found them increasingly frustrating as they spoke. "Are you sick? Do you think we're still in the old days? You were school bullies back then, but how dare you do this again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Camille Strickland's yelling did not get to them. Instead, they became more aggressive. "Camille Strickland, it's none of your business. You'd better stay out of this, or you're gonna be in trouble!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland said brusquely, "You'll all be in trouble if you try to do anything to Valda."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How funny. We'll see how it goes, then," the crowd laughed arrogantly. Two pulled Camille Strickland away from Valda Theller, while another one walked up to Valda Theller with a bottle of wine. They said," Valda Theller, why aren't you kneeling yet? You'll have to drink this today as an apology even if you don't want to! We can't let Yanqing suffer for nothing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took a deep breath. "I've done nothing wrong. Why should I drink as an apology? Barbara Schuman and Raymond Bowman know very well what happened. I've done nothing wrong to them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'They wronged me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman seemed to frown disapprovingly at that. She was even more upset at the thought that Raymond Bowman had rejected her because of Valda Theller.</p></div>
