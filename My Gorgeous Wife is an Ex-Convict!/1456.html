        <h1>Chapter 1455</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now that Old Master Reed had passed away, Grace was officially the mistress of the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Besides, it was said that Grace was pregnant with triplets. When the three babies were born, her position as the mistress of the Reed family would probably be more secure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, the people who attended Old Master Reed's funeral all treated Grace with respect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As the deceased's family member, Grace stood beside Jason throughout. The funeral ceremony for a family like the Reed family was naturally more complicated than an ordinary family&rsquo;s.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was afraid that Grace would get exhausted and asked her to sit down and rest, but she still insisted on staying by his side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm not tired yet. I'll tell you if I am. I wouldn't risk my health," she said, well aware that she was not alone now. She was carrying three babies in her belly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, the ushers outside the funeral service called out Brian's name. Grace suddenly shuddered and turned her head in the direction of the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She only saw a familiar figure in a black suit coming this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Speaking of which, she and Brian had not seen each other for months. He was once her childhood friend who had gone through thick and thin with her, but they parted under such circumstances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian attended Old Master Reed's funeral with his parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace looked at him, his eyes also fell on her. There was a flash of pain in his phoenix eyes, and the hands at his sides were clenched slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He missed the person he had been persistently looking for for so many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He and she had gotten another chance, but he ruined it with his own hands. She was now the wife of another man, standing by his side while she carried his children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the end, he could not be the one to stand by her side!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the three members of the Hart family walked up to Grace and Jason, Mr. Hart and Madam Hart said some pleasantries and comforting words. Meanwhile, Brian said nothing and just stared at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After saying their greetings, Mr. Hart and Madam Hart walked to their seats. However, Brian remained standing where he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Brian!" Madam Hart called out in a low voice, afraid that her son might do something inappropriate on such an occasion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Madam Hart also knew about her son's feelings toward Grace. It was a good thing for the Hart family that Grace had not gotten together with her son. After all, in Madam Hart's opinion, Grace was not worthy of the Hart family or her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he seemed to be a different person these days. He had grown colder and did not seem to be interested in anything. He even spent a lot of time in his studio every day. Therefore, Madam Hart was worried once more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once, she had secretly opened the studio door and saw her son inside, looking like he was possessed. He had been crying and laughing while holding a painting of Grace in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a look of sadness on his face that Madam Hart had never seen before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Madam Hart suddenly thought that maybe it would not have been that bad if Grace had gotten together with her son. She had no idea when her son would move on from his feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, Brian seemed to not have heard Madam Hart's voice. He just stood where he was and looked at Grace without moving.</p></div>
