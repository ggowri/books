        <h1>Chapter 3428</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, if you have something to say, just say it nicely. Don't grip my hand like this," she said. At the moment, they were standing too close to each other, and it made her feel a bit uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like having a bad feeling about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you not like it this way, elder sister?" He lowered his head even more, and his lips lightly brushed against her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could she possibly like him?" Veronica bit her lip and asked, "This feels awkward, what's wrong with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I really want to know what's wrong with me!" he said softly. "Sister, were you really shopping with Pamela today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica trembled as she met his cold gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze... it was as if he knew who her real date was today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No, he... he couldn't possibly know! She should say "yes" at this point, but the word seemed to be stuck in her throat and she couldn't say it no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes... or no?" he continued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica took a deep breath. "I'm sorry, Mason. I lied to you earlier. I didn't go shopping with Pamela today. I went with Daniel."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their eyes met, and the air seemed to freeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, you lied to me before," he said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sorry," she apologized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why did you lie to me? Was it for Daniel?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why? Actually, Veronica couldn't even explain to herself why she had to lie!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Maybe... it's because you had a conflict with Daniel before, so I didn't tell you the truth all of a sudden," Veronica thought for a moment and said, "I'm sorry, I won't do this again in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the future..." his voice trailed off, "So, are you planning to go on another date with Daniel, Sister Ah?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She suddenly choked up, thinking about the moment when she parted ways with Daniel earlier that day. He had asked her if she would like to go watch a basketball game between their school team and another school's team the next time they had the chance. She remained silent, which was essentially her way of agreeing to go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This default setting just makes him even more uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I were to ask you, Sister, to stop seeing Daniel altogether, and not even give him a second glance, would you agree?" he said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked at him in surprise and asked, "Why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just don't want to, no particular reason," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it because of the conflict you had with Daniel? But actually, he was just trying to break up the fight that time. It was his classmate who started the physical altercation. Besides, Daniel is actually a nice person. If you get to know him, you'll find out..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't want to listen!" he interrupted her, "I just want you, sister, to not meet him alone anymore, to not look at him, and to not talk to him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can you please stop being unreasonable?" she said. "Mason, I have the freedom to make friends, and I hope you can respect that. Besides, I've said it before, no matter what, you are still my family, my important younger brother. I won't ignore you just because I made new friends!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought he was like when they were children, deeply afraid of being ignored by her.</p></div>
