        <h1>Chapter 1618</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was so used to receiving attention from people around him that he did not mind it at all. He just lowered his head and asked Grace, "What flavor do you want? How about several servings of each flavor?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oh, no, that&rsquo;d be a waste," said Grace even though she knew it would not cost him much even if he bought the entire cake shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she still did not want to be extravagant and waste money just because they were rich. "I'll go for dark chocolate. What about you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm fine with anything." He had no particular preference for cakes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he was willing to eat with her if she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace knew Jason did not have a sweet tooth, so she chose a blueberry cake for Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They got two slices of cake. She took a small spoon and took a bite of the dark chocolate cake. It tasted unique. Compared to the usual dark chocolate, it was a bit more creamy and rich in texture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It tastes pretty good. Do you want to try mine?" asked Grace. She took a spoonful of the cake in her hand and then raised it to Jason's lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she was doing this, she noticed she was... feeding him cake in public.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not unusual for married couples to do this, but the problem was that... there were many pairs of eyes looking their way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was about to hand Jason the spoon with the cake when he opened his mouth and ate the cake she fed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's pretty good," Jason said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help blushing as many young women around them whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Gosh, that man just ate the cake that woman fed him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The man is so handsome. Is he a celebrity?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are they filming? Is there a hidden camera?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, a voice suddenly rang out. "Grace!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace followed the voice to see Lina and a man standing beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The man was quite good-looking, and with his glasses, he looked sophisticated. He was quite likable at first sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who's this?" Grace asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oh, this is my friend, Anthony Sherman. Yulai, this is Grace, the best friend I mentioned," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hello, I'm Anthony Sherman," said Anthony Sherman as he extended his hand politely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hello, I'm Grace." Grace reached out to shake his hand, only to be stopped by Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason grabbed Anthony Sherman's hand and smiled. "Hello, I'm Jason, Grace's husband."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace thought to herself, 'Did Jay do that on purpose? Does he dislike me shaking hands with Anthony Sherman?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was still time, so the four found a table in the corner of the cake shop and sat down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Anthony Sherman and Lina went to choose their cakes, Grace asked Jason, "You don't like me shaking hands with other men?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly but frankly admitted. "Yes."</p></div>
