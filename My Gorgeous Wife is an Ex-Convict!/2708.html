        <h1>Chapter 2706</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke with a calm expression on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he became irritable because of what she said. "Why should I spend a day playing pretend with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That way, you can get rid of me faster. We have 25 days left in our agreed three-month period, but you&rsquo;ll only need to spend a day with me to get rid of me,&rdquo; she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." He pressed his thin lips together tightly as his dark eyes glared darkly at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "But don't worry. I&rsquo;m aware of your physical condition, and I&rsquo;ll try to arrange a more laid-back itinerary so as not to strain you too much. What about you? Do you want to be annoyed for 25 days or just one more day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pondered for a moment before finally saying, "One day, then. Sign the divorce papers one day later!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay! Then come downstairs at eight in the morning tomorrow and have breakfast with me. You'll have to do whatever I say for the rest of the day," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," answered Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla left the study while Martin Weiss raised his hands and rubbed his temples a little tiredly. She would no longer constantly appear in front of him the day after tomorrow. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would stop feeling flustered and have peace as long as he stopped seeing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla walked downstairs just in time to see Shana Nicholls ready to go upstairs with his food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls taunted, "Mrs. Weiss, I advise you to not waste your time anymore. Even if you've cooked a table of food, Mr. Weiss won't eat it. Why waste your time and energy like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "You don't have to worry about that. Also, please tell me the instructions for Martin's pills tomorrow morning. I'll be taking care of Martin's schedule tomorrow. You can take a day off tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls was shocked. "No way. I'm Mr. Weiss's nurse. I should be by Mr. Weiss's side every day to take care of his health."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can ask him if you don't believe me," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls pursed her red lips, said nothing more, and went upstairs. Kyla sat at the large dining table and began to eat the dinner she had meticulously prepared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I would have cooked all this food tomorrow if I had known. He... He'll probably eat it if I cook another table of food tomorrow," she muttered to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tomorrow... Tomorrow was the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she would cherish the next 25 days, but it turned out that her plans could not keep up with changes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she did not regret it. She did not regret impulsively making this decision in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One day of perfection was worth 25 days of estrangement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin, even if I don't want to lose you, we still... ended up losing each other, after all..." She put the food in her mouth and chewed it. It was supposed to be delicious, but it tasted so bitter and astringent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon waking up the next day, Kyla changed into a dress and applied light makeup. She let down her hair that she usually casually tied up. It made her look several years younger.</p></div>
