        <h1>Chapter 2439</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Kyla anxiously and said to her, "Don't worry. Since they managed to bring Amber Mitchell out of the Mitchell family's mansion, all you have to do now is wait for the good news."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But if the Mitchell family finds Amber Mitchell before the results are out, they have the right to stop the doctor's evaluation," Kyla said uneasily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... we&rsquo;ll stop them," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you have a way to do that?" She froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have a few men in Deer City. It shouldn't be a problem to stop them for an hour or two," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But we have no idea where they are right now. Didn't Grace say we'll expose their whereabouts if the Mitchell family members follow us when we go look for them?" Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said confidently, "Then we should follow the Mitchell family. It's fine if the Mitchell family doesn&rsquo;t find Amber Mitchell, but if they do manage to find her, my men will stop them.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words made Kyla's eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, what they were most worried about now was that the Mitchell family would find Amber Mitchell, so they could only follow them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss took out his phone, made a call, and commanded his subordinates to start the operation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said gratefully, "Thank you for helping! If there's anything I can do for you in the future, just let me know and I'll try my best."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He peered at her. "Kyla, what do you think you can do to help me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stiffened, and a flicker of embarrassment came over her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, how could I have forgotten? There's nothing I can do for him!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Biting her lip slightly, she murmured, "I only... said it in the heat of the moment. I made a joke of myself. I just wanted to express my gratitude."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to express your gratitude, stop acting like you care about me," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more she did so, the more he was flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He might not be able to control his heart if this went on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss sent some people to follow the Mitchell family. Of course, he also asked his men to keep an eye on the Gregory family and the police. After all, the Mitchell and Gregory families were on the same side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Soon, Martin Weiss received a report from his men that the Gregory family, the Mitchell family, and the police had gathered and were about to head to a private hospital in tMason Swansonty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face darkened at that. After ending the conversation, he said to Kyla, "I'm afraid that the Mitchell family, the Gregory family, and the police have already located Amber Mitchell. But I don't know if Amber Mitchell's preliminary mental evaluation is done."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was shocked. "They&rsquo;ve found her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's highly likely. Call Grace and ask if they&rsquo;re in this hospital," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hurriedly made the call. Grace was already aware that the Mitchell family, the Gregory family, and the police were on their way. However, Grace still comforted Kyla by saying, "Don't worry, I'm prepared for that. They can't take Amber Mitchell away so easily even if they come."</p></div>
