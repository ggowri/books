        <h1>Chapter 1252</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what was more embarrassing had yet to come.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Pick it up! Since you threw the dress on the floor, you should pick it up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why should I do what you say and pick it up?" Stella asked angrily. She then said to the staff nearby, "Are you not going to kick this woman out? Okay, I'll do it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She reached out and grabbed Grace as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before Stella could touch Grace, she was stopped by an average-looking woman standing behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the blink of an eye, the woman twisted Stella&rsquo;s hand. Stella was easily overcome and squealed in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Madam, what do you intend to do with this person?" the woman asked Grace respectfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said coldly, "Ask her to pick the dress up." This was the female bodyguard Jason had assigned to protect her, and she was naturally a skilled fighter. Otherwise, she would not have recklessly gotten into a conflict with Stella while pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." The bodyguard then said to Stella, "You heard what Young Madam said. Pick the dress up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why should I?" Stella asked as her face became red, but then a sharp pain came from her twisted arm, hurting her terribly. She could only say to the staff, "Are you guys dead? Can't you help me out? If you don't throw these two people out of this store, you guys can forget about staying in Emerald City!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was so overwhelmed with pain and anger that she did not even notice the words &lsquo;Young Madam&rsquo; the female bodyguard had addressed Grace or wonder why Grace had a female bodyguard beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was a regular customer of the shop, so the people in the shop naturally knew that she had the entertainment industry's crown prince, Brian, backing her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hurry, go and help Miss Lindsay!" The shop manager was clearly on Stella's side now. After all, they could not afford to offend the crown prince.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, another voice rang out. "If any of you dare to help her, you can really forget about staying in Emerald City!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cold voice and light tone gave people a strong sense of oppression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The voice...' Grace was stunned and immediately raised her head to see Jason walking toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wore a gray suit with a navy blue shirt, looking elegant but with a touch of mystery. With that handsome face of his, he was utterly attractive to women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason walked up to Grace. "Did you get into trouble?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "It's not too much of a problem. Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I knew you were here. I just happened to be free, so I came to have a look," said Jason as he naturally held Grace's hand. Then he frowned slightly. "It's a little cold."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he put his hands together, held her hands, and rubbed them gently to warm her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such a move stunned the people around them.</p></div>
