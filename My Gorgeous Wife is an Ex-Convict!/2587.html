        <h1>Chapter 2585</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just do what you think you should. Don't bother with the rest," said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her daughter had minded too many things that she came to hide her misery in her heart and suffered in silence. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only wanted her daughter to be happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Kyla and Mrs. Corbyn in front of her, Grace could not help the flicker of envy in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was envious that Mrs. Corbyn would always stand by Kyla's side no matter what happened. She did not have many memories of her mother. The photo album her mother left behind was also half-burned!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, perhaps her mother would be glad for her if she were still alive and learned about her current life. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace silently left the store so that Kyla and Mrs. Corbyn could have some time alone. She came to the entrance of the primary school. It was almost time for school to end for the day, so parents had begun to gather at the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace joined the legion of parents and began waiting for lessons to end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she was here today, she might as well pick up Mason and Veronica after school. She also wanted to talk to Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the school bell rang, the first person Grace saw was Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"aunt Cummins, did you come to pick up Mason and Veronica?" Upon seeing Grace, Nelson Corbyn quickly walked up to her and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, but I also wanted to see you," said Grace, who felt emotional when the tiny three-year-old she first met had now become a ten-year-old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, have you seen my sister, aunt Cummins? My sister is so cute. I like her so much." After Trista returned home, Nelson Corbyn's greatest joy every day was to look at his sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would also offer to feed her and cuddle her to sleep like a grown-up when she cried. He was saving up his pocket money to buy her toys when she was older.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In short, Nelson Corbyn now looked like he was becoming a brother who doted on his sister excessively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I saw Trista today. Here, I want to tell you something." Grace half-crouched and looked sternly at Nelson Corbyn. In her opinion, the child was precocious and sensible. He was only ten years old, but he had a sense of responsibility that children his age rarely had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn instantly realized that what Grace had to say to him must be something important, so his little face turned solemn instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Your mommy found out your daddy donated her his liver a second time and is crying while hugging your grandma. I don't know what choice your mommy will make in the end, but I want you to know that one of the reasons your daddy left your mommy to go back to L City is because he doesn&rsquo;t want your mommy to know that he donated his liver again. He doesn&rsquo;t want your mommy to be psychologically burdened."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn's eyes widened. "Daddy... donated his liver to Mommy again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, he donated his liver, and it was extremely risky because he has already donated his liver once. He had to cut a piece of his liver for your mommy for the second time. He might have died on the operating table," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew Nelson had always been hostile to Martin Weiss. After all, Martin Weiss had made many mistakes.</p></div>
