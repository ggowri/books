        <h1>Chapter 3907</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The passage of time always flies by.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was discharged smoothly after giving birth, and after two years of postpartum, she returned to school to finish the courses she had not completed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper and William held their engagement ceremony when little Pearl was three years old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, according to William and Jasper's plan, they would get married directly after graduating from college.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Jason directly opposed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The reason for his opposition was that their daughter was still a little young, and also, "If you still love this man after three years, then I will agree to you marrying him without any obstruction."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These were Jason's exact words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, I'm very sure that he's the one I want to marry in this lifetime!" Jasper said with absolute certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since you're so sure, what's wrong with waiting another three years?" Jason smiled and looked at his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was a bit speechless by her father's words. "Why do I have to wait for another three years?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because I'm worried whether my daughter really loves William that much, or if it's just because he's been by your side all this time, and there's no other option around you, so you chose him?" Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Dad, I chose William not because there was no one else to choose from!" Jasper argued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're still too young, just graduated from college, and haven't seen much of the world yet. So I hope you can give yourself three years. If you're really sure that William is the one you want to spend the rest of your life with, then spend three more years dating him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was Jason's insistence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper naturally understood that her father was doing this out of concern for her, fearing that her feelings for William were not as strong as she thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Three years, it's just three years, and it will pass quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By then, her father will naturally understand her feelings for William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Jasper finally agreed to get engaged first and get married after three years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William naturally had no objections to this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even the engagement between the two of them was grand and spectacular.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The union of the Barlow family and the Reed family was a typical engagement of a prince and a princess, a strong alliance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, William and Jasper were both typical handsome and beautiful people, fully satisfying people's imagination!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So for a while, the two of them were frequently on the hot search.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the engagement banquet, for several days, Jasper would always stare at a snowflake-shaped hairpin in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This hairpin was the gift they received at their engagement banquet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There are special people in charge of registering gifts on the receiving end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But this gift was not registered at all and appeared in the pile of gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the same time, there was no information in the gift box indicating who the sender was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, anyone who saw the gift would understand that it was valuable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A hair clip made entirely of high-quality diamonds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Such a hair clip would be worth a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were many valuable gifts at her engagement party, some given by families with close ties to the Reed family, and others given to curry favor with the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But no one would send such a valuable gift anonymously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So who could have sent it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could it be... Xuehua?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's mind conjured up a face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just thinking of that person made her heart tighten involuntarily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you thinking about?" A familiar voice sounded behind her.</p></div>
