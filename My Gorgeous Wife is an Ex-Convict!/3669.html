        <h1>Chapter 3667</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's gaze followed Jasper's and landed on the empty seat, "Why do your eyes keep looking at that seat?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper put down her cutlery and picked up a cocktail from the side, taking a sip, "Because the last time I came to see Lawrence, he was sitting there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's eyes flickered slightly, so was Jasper here today to eat because she was thinking about Lawrence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"People really do change over time, Lawrence...he's changed a lot," Jasper murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you always think about him?" William suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I guess so," she admitted frankly, "Ever since I found out he was Lawrence, it's been hard not to think about him. Almost every time I close my eyes, all I see are childhood memories and all the encounters we had at Stanford University."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These memories played like a movie in her mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't always think about him, okay?" William spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at him in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But William suddenly lowered his head again, burying himself in his own plate of food, "Don't mind what I just said earlier, I was just...talking nonsense."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him, as if thinking about something, then lowered her head again and continued eating her dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the two finished eating, William got up to pay the bill while Jasper sat at the table sipping his cocktail.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By now, the bar was lively with music that had turned into intense beats and the noise level had increased.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were even quite a few couples and some strangers who, in this atmosphere, quickly became friends.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at the lively scene in the bar and wondered why he had come here for dinner.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps he just wanted to experience what it was like for William to sit in a bar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, a group of people walked into the bar, and one of them shouted, "Mr. Elliott is the most capable one. He just met such a beautiful senior sister. I wish we had the chance to do the same."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You? Even if you had Roger's appearance, you wouldn't have his temperament!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Senior sister, which part of Roger do you like?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was startled and looked up to see Roger walking into the bar with some people, and a beautiful woman was intimately hugging his arm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this woman was not the same one she had seen before who was being affectionate with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper frowned. What was going on? Where was the girl he had seen before?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger noticed her gaze and looked in her direction, but his expression changed when he saw her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then his expression changed again, and he lowered his head to talk to the beautiful woman next to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, let's go." At the same time, William's voice sounded in Jasper's ear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper turned to see that William had already paid the bill and come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay." She responded, putting down her glass and picking up her bag, walking towards the exit of the bar with William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as they were about to pass by Roger and his group, Roger's voice suddenly rang out--</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, you two aren't going to say hello since we've run into each other?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's footsteps suddenly halted, feeling William's five fingers holding her hand slowly tightening, gripping her hand tighter.</span></p></div>
