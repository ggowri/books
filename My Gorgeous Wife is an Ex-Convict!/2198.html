        <h1>Chapter 2196</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Good boy!" Lina replied with a smile. Sure enough, the words &lsquo;Aunt Lina&rsquo; were more pleasant to the ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace continued to ask curiously, "Why do you want to be with Tina? You seem to have said you wanted to be with Tina when Aunt Lina was pregnant with her, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Shaking his head, the little boy said, "I can't tell you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'He can't tell me?' Curiosity flashed across Grace's eyes. In other words, there must be a reason for this but it was a secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In conclusion, there was no way a seven or eight-year-old child could fall in love with a baby at first sight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do you have superpowers?" Grace asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy blinked, clearly puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why were you so sure Aunt Lina was carrying a girl when you first saw her? And why could your blood save Aunt Lina and wake her up?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, why?" Lina also widened her eyes and looked at the child in front of her in curiosity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was so amazed the last time he came to see Tina that she forgot to ask all these questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just thought it was a baby girl," the little boy said as if this instinct was perfectly normal. "Also, Aunt Lina was poisoned, so my blood could wake her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Huh?" Grace and Lina froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Because my blood is more toxic," the little boy answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What? More toxic?" Lina was startled and almost bounced up from her chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, my blood is quite like the layman's poison. Of course, fighting poison with poison could wake you up," the little boy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then... I don't have any more strange poisons in my body, do I? No, when... When I was discharged from the hospital, why didn't my test results say I still had toxins in my body?" mumbled Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You don't have any toxins in your body now." The little boy would not say any more than that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina suddenly thought of something and said, "Well... if your blood is really toxic, you have to be careful. Don't go near Tina when... you're wounded. What if Tina comes into contact with your blood? She... She's still a baby. She doesn't have any immunity." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina began to worry about her daughter who was still being held by the little boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Tina Stephenson had just finished drinking the milk in the bottle. The little boy put Tina Stephenson up and burped her with his little hands. He seemed experienced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"My blood won't be a problem for Tina because she's different," the little boy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina and Grace asked how she was different, the little boy refused to speak again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In short, the little boy was mysterious. It was as if he had many mysteries surrounding him, but he had been very nice to Tina Stephenson thus far.</p></div>
