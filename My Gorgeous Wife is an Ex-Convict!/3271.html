        <h1>Chapter 3269</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What she said was, "Next time you can't do this. Don't hurt yourself more just to protect the watch!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at her blankly and said, "But... that's the watch Mr. Barlow gave me. It's very... very expensive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just a watch!" Jasper said. "My mom always said that if you ever get robbed, the most important thing is not how to prevent the other person from taking your things, but how to protect yourself because people are more important than things!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After pausing for a moment, she continued very seriously, "So Lawrence, if you ever encounter this kind of situation again, you must first protect yourself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But the watch..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You are much more important than a watch!" she said. "I don't like seeing Lawrence getting hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the center of his chest, it suddenly felt like something exploded, leaving him confused but also very happy...very happy...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is he also important in her eyes?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the hospital, the doctor examined Lawrence and found that he only had some minor cuts and bruises on his skin, without any bone injuries. He just needs to apply some medicine for a few days and he'll be fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper breathed a sigh of relief and said, "That's good. The doctor said your injury will heal quickly. Lawrence, in the future, you must not hurt yourself while trying to protect something. Your own body is the most important thing!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence stared at Jasper, feeling a warm sensation in his chest. After a moment, he nodded and said, "Okay, Jasper, I understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you keep calling me Jasper? I already told you, you can call me Jasper!" said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence stuttered and called out "Jasper" from his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's face immediately lit up with a bright smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing this, Wilona felt secretly pleased. Indeed, Jasper was exceptional when it came to his own son. Seizing the opportunity, she directly called out to Jasper using "Jasper". "Jasper, although Lawrence didn't suffer any major injuries this time, he's always being bullied by others at school. This time it was his watch, who knows what it will be next time? What do you think we should do about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona spoke while making a sad and teary expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper is just a 10-year-old child with a simple mind. He couldn't tell that Wilona was just pretending. He immediately promised, "I will protect Lawrence and make sure he won't be bullied at school again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona was delighted and said, "That's great! Thank you, Jasper, on behalf of Auntie Wilona!" She then nudged her son and said, "Lawrence, say thank you quickly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence seems a bit dazed and asks Jasper, "Do you really... want to protect me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right." Jasper nodded naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But...you, as a girl, shouldn't it be the boys' responsibility to protect the girls?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where did you get that idea? Girls can also protect boys! My mom always says she wants to protect my dad!" Jasper said, and then suddenly seemed to have thought of something, "Lawrence, don't you like being protected by girls?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I don't have it," Lawrence said hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So if I protect you, are you happy?" Jasper asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He bit his lower lip and nodded his head slightly, "Happy."</p></div>
