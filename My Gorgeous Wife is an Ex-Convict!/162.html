        <h1>Chapter 161</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was just this time, the one who was being beaten and the one carrying out the beating had been reversed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Emily covered her face with her hands and her expression was one of disbelief. "You... you hit me?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Since you can hit me, why can't I hit you back?" Grace retorted. Even if she had to take responsibility, Emily wouldn't end up any better.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Who do you think you are? You're just a third-rate celebrity. What right do you have to hit me?" Emily was going crazy with anger.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although Grace was not the "celebrity" as she was called by the other party&mdash;&mdash;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What about you? You're just a small-time celebrity yourself, and if it weren't for Brian, do you think you'd be what you are today? You ran over here in such a fluster today only because you broke up with Brian and you're afraid that you'll lose everything. Everything you have was built on this man's willingness to help you. Do you really think that you're a more noble person than me?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's words alone made Emily's face redden, not to mention that she was being watched by onlookers. Emily felt that she was falling deeper and deeper into a pit, and she absolutely hated the person in front of her. She raised her hand and was about to slap her in the face again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But, this time, her hand was grabbed by someone from behind.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Emily was shocked. Then, a voice came from behind her, "What are you doing, Emily?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Emily's body froze. She slowly turned around and saw a handsome but cold face. A pair of sharp eyes were looking at her, filled with impatience.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Emily suddenly shivered and a chill ran down her spine. She knew that whenever this impatience flashed across Brian's eyes, it represented his utmost displeasure.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Brian, I just heard that you were here, and I... I wanted to see you..." Emily's voice trailed off.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You were looking for me?" Brian's eyes glanced at Grace's red cheek. "Was it her who hit you?" he asked Grace, completely ignoring the side of Emily's face that was also red.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I hit her back," Grace replied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is it enough to just hit her back once?" He asked in a calm tone as if he was just casually talking about an ordinary thing.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace and Emily were both stunned by his words. Grace seemed to be thinking about what he had said, but Emily seemed to have come to an understanding. Her face immediately turned pale and her body began to tremble.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why don't you hit her a few more times so that you can vent your anger? After all, she was the one who provoked you today and she should pay the price for it, shouldn't she?" Brian said. There was no expression on his cold face.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Brian, I... I won't do this again. Please forgive me just this once," Emily said, begging forgiveness in a hurry. Her pretty face was full of panic.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was afraid that her fans would be shocked if they were to see her like this.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this time, the staff of the restaurant also rushed over after noticing the commotion. After seeing that one of the people involved was Brian, they quickly dispersed the surrounding onlookers.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, scandals about Brian, the Crown Prince of the entertainment industry, was not something just anyone could witness!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And so, after a while, there was no one left around the three of them.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, no matter how much Emily pleaded with Brian, he would not even look at her once. It was as if she was nothing in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It wasn't until this moment that Grace finally understood what the people on the internet meant when they talked about how cold-blooded Brian was when he broke up with his ex-girlfriends.</p></div>
