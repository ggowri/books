        <h1>Chapter 4401: Awakening</h1>
        <div><p>Harley immediately cleared out the restaurant, taking Calvert with him and heading to the hospital!</p><p>All the way, Calvert was feeling particularly awful. He was curled up like a shrimp, his face flushed red, and his whole body was shaking non-stop.</p><p>He was practically using all his strength to suppress his desires. Yet, even when he closed his eyes tightly, all sorts of beautiful fantasies would still continuously emerge in his mind.</p><p>My body feels like it&#x27;s about to explode.</p><p>Just then, a voice rang in his ear, &quot;Are you feeling bad?&quot;</p><p>Immediately after, a hand gently touched his forehead, wiping away the sweat that was breaking out on his face.</p><p>That hand was so cool to the touch. Just a slight contact made him feel so comfortable where it touched, as if it was cooling him down.</p><p>But... that&#x27;s too little!</p><p>That&#x27;s way too little!</p><p>He wanted her to explore more, to experience more...</p><p>Suddenly, Calvert&#x27;s eyes snapped open, and Harley&#x27;s face was reflected in those passionate, dark eyes.</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t... don&#x27;t touch me...&quot; He stammered, his lips trembling as he struggled to utter these few words.</p><p>&quot;What?&quot; Harley was suddenly confused.</p><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t... don&#x27;t touch me... or else... I won&#x27;t... won&#x27;t be able to control myself...&quot; His voice trembled as he spoke, and then he closed his eyes again.</p><p>Every time he looked at her, his desire deepened, making his self-control even weaker!</p><p>Harley finally understood what was going on. His face turned red instantly, and he stopped wiping the sweat off Calvert&#x27;s face.</p><p>After all, her actions might also be a form of torment for him.</p><p>Finally, they arrived at the hospital. Calvert was rushed into the emergency room, while Harley anxiously waited outside.</p><p>He should be safe now that he&#x27;s at the hospital, but why does she still feel so anxious?</p><p>Even when she saw Calvert in distress, his eyes filled with desire, she found herself wanting to help him relieve that desire.</p><p>Oh my God, what on earth is she thinking!</p><p>Harley quickly dismissed the thoughts in his mind.</p><p>After a good while, the doctor came out and said to Harley, &quot;Everything&#x27;s been taken care of, and I&#x27;ve given Mr. Elledge a sedative. He&#x27;ll be fine once he wakes up.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So... don&#x27;t I need to take any more medicine?&quot; Harley asked.</p><p>&quot;No need for that. Just have him drink more water in the next few days to flush out the residual medication from his body. However, in the following days, his body might react more easily than usual. Just ignore it,&quot; the doctor said.</p><p>Harley was initially listening to the doctor&#x27;s advice with a serious face. But as the conversation went on, his face turned red again. Uh... &#x27;Easily reactive,&#x27; such words really make one&#x27;s mind wander!</p><p>The nurse took a comatose Calvert to the ward, with Harley following closely behind.</p><p>Once the nurse left, Harley sat by the bed, looking at Calvert lying on the hospital bed.</p><p>Now, his complexion has returned to normal, no longer constantly sweating. With his eyes closed, he looks like he&#x27;s peacefully asleep.</p><p>Today&#x27;s experience must have felt like a nightmare to him.</p><p>If she hadn&#x27;t rushed over, what terrible things might have happened to him?</p><p>Thinking of this, a smile unconsciously crept up on Harley&#x27;s lips. He was glad he made it in time to protect him. It felt really good!</p><p>When Calvert slowly opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was Harley, asleep by his bedside.</p></div>
