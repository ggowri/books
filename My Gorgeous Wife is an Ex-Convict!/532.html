        <h1>Chapter 531</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace heard about the Farmer family's affairs from the news. Although their tax evasion scandal had been covertly reported in the news before, with the Farmer family's ability, it was unlikely that the entire enterprise could not turn over just because of this matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip; Unless Jason was one of the driving forces. Otherwise, with the Farmer family's connections, they could always find several helpers and would not reach the point of being annihilated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she asked Jason about it, he simply replied, "Tasha Farmer picked on you. Of course, they deserve it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's her problem. It has nothing to do with her family..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Her family's business was already full of problems. I simply exposed them first. Besides, business is business. People in the business world are not fools. Many are waiting for the Farmer family to slip up so that they can take over their convenience store chain's market share," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace heard and understood somewhat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, she could also understand somewhat what Jason did to the Farmer family was not only because Tasha Farmer picked on her, but also as a reminder to the business community in Emerald City. That way, no one would dare to pick on her like Tasha Farmer in the future. If they did&hellip; It meant they were not afraid to end up like the Farmer family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It feels like I'm always dragging you down. You have to protect me over and over again," said Grace as she bit her lip slightly. This was what happened to the Atkinson family last time and the same went for Tasha Farmer this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I don't protect you, then who should I protect? Besides, I don't think you're dragging me down," said Jason as he lifted his finger and caressed her lips. "Stop biting your lip. I love getting to protect you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was more than glad that she was willing to accept his protection. His greatest fear was that she would not let him protect her one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to protect you for the rest of my life, all right?" He bent down gently, his dark eyes looking straight at her while his deep voice was like the night wind&mdash;cool and full of never-ending longing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a little stunned. It was as if he had put himself at the bottom of the scale, waiting for her approval. He even looked like he would do anything for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was supposed to be the one to thank him, but now there was a misconception that it was the other way around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could she not love such a man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," Grace answered softly as she blushed. She felt a sudden longing in her heart. Would she one day be able to protect him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to be the only one weak and protected. She wanted to stand in the same position as him so that they could protect each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips pressed gently onto hers, and his magnetic voice once again rang in her ear, "Grace..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she could only see was his bright eyes, which were now tinged with the most intense desire...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Well, one night of tossing around gave her back pain the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason offered to ask for a day off for her, but she immediately refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're afraid of taking a day off and no one being at the restaurant to deliver the orders, I can get someone to take your place," said Jason.</p></div>
