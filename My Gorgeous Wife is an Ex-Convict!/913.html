        <h1>Chapter 912</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pursed her lips and asked with a sigh, "Where is he?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to see Master Reed, you can come downstairs later. I'll take you to Master Reed," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked and did not expect that Terrence was already downstairs. 'Did Jason&hellip; already expect this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did he already expect her to beg him to get them out after learning where Kyla and Nelson are, so he asked Terrence to wait downstairs beforehand?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt as though a net had caught her. She could not break free from it nor escape!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, got it," said Grace before putting away her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she returned to her desk, it was the end of the day. Her colleagues began to leave the office. Grace packed her things quickly and left the firm. As it was time to get off work, she did not have to ask for leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was downstairs, she saw a grey car parked opposite the building. A second later, Terrence stepped out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace approached him and Terrence helped her to open the door to the back seat. "Miss Cummins, please."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got into the car and Terrence drove off slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not far away, several figures came out of the building. After seeing that scene, someone exclaimed, "Gosh, Grace got into that car! It's a Maybach. It isn't cheap!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz looked at the car with jealousy in her eyes... 'Why does Grace get to ride a Maybach?' "Hmph, she's just a mistress. The young models and influencers that Curtis Row usually dates are beautiful. Grace is just a breath of fresh air."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz thought the luxury car was Curtis Row's!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"However, it doesn't seem to be Curtis Row who opened the car door for Grace," someone said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's probably a driver. It's normal for rich people to have their chauffeur pick people up. Do you expect them to pick people up themselves? Her condescendence to be a mistress is a disgrace to the conduct of our firm," said Andrea Schwartz as she curled her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's not necessarily a mistress. Maybe they're just dating like normal folks," someone said, defending Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmph. That's just a way to put it nicely. Frankly speaking, she's only in it for the money. Well, she was Sean's girlfriend before she went to prison after all. Her life has taken a nosedive since she got into prison, so of course, she's holding on to all the money she can get," said Andrea Schwartz.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One day, she was going to kick Grace out of the firm. She wanted Grace to know how she felt when she was thrown out of her old firm!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace watched as the car moved forward, but it was heading toward the west of the city.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was neither the direction of Reed Residence nor the headquarters of Reed Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car stopped, Grace saw a restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a time-honored restaurant in Emerald City with a history of over a hundred years. However, although it was a time-honored restaurant, it was not accessible to common folks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It usually only welcomed guests from rich and powerful families, and their dishes were of imperial cuisine level. It was said that only five people in the whole country could cook a dish of the highest rank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence had brought her here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The restaurant was far more secluded than Grace expected. Even as she followed Terrence in, she did not see a single customer and only spotted the restaurant staff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why is there no one here?" Grace could not resist asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence smiled and said, "Master Reed booked the entire restaurant today."</p></div>
