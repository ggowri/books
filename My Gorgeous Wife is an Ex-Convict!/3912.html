        <h1>Chapter 3910</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Mick heard this name, he was slightly stunned. This name had appeared in his memory before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To be honest, he rarely remembered the name of a woman who had nothing to do with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But strangely, he remembered this name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked up and followed the voice, seeing a scene that seemed familiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The face in his memory turned slightly to the side after being slapped, and those eyes happened to catch a glimpse of him standing in the shadows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sure enough, it was the Nancy from his memory!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He originally thought it might just be a coincidence of the same name or similar pronunciation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at that moment, he was sure that it was the same Nancy he had seen at Mason's wedding hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the person who slapped her seemed to be the same woman who had slapped her at the hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for what the other person's name was, Mick naturally couldn't remember.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Nancy saw Mick, she was also stunned, but then she lowered her eyes as if she hadn't seen him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You knew that the Reed family was having a birthday banquet here today, and that the Schultz family was invited. Yet, you still chose to work as a server here. How can the Schultz family hold their heads up high?" Clarissa said fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't think there's anything shameful about being a server," Nancy replied. She studied hotel management in college and naturally found a job in a hotel after graduation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Strictly speaking, she was a team leader in the hotel banquet department, but she didn't plan on telling her sister, who wasn't related by blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyway, in the eyes of the other party, it was just a job that would make the Schultz family lose face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How dare you say that? Are you trying to make the Schultz family a laughingstock? You better leave this banquet hall right now!" Clarissa exclaimed angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't leave. This is my job," Nancy refused directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What, do you think you can act recklessly just because you moved out of the Schultz family? Let me tell you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's words were interrupted by a voice, "It's really funny, who is disturbing someone's normal work and acting recklessly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa was about to curse, but when she looked up, she swallowed her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's eyes lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had finally managed to get her father to obtain an invitation to the Reed family's birthday banquet today, and had dressed up specially to come here, just to find an opportunity to talk to Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She just didn't expect that he would see this scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This reminded Clarissa of the wedding banquet where she first met Mick. She had deliberately approached him, but ended up making a fool of herself and being ridiculed by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Reed, you misunderstood. It's not what you think," Clarissa said hastily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Misunderstood?" Mick sneered lightly. "So, was the slap she just received also a misunderstanding on my part?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's face immediately became extremely ugly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't expect the other party to have witnessed the scene where she slapped her sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I'm still waiting for your answer," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa became even more embarrassed, her face turning red.</p></div>
