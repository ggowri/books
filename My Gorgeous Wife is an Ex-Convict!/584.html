        <h1>Chapter 583</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace... Had better luck than her! Kyla's eyes dimmed when she thought of her past. Once, she also thought she had met a man who was willing to fight the whole world for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it turned out that the man regarded her as his enemy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pathetic and ridiculous&mdash;that was her comment on that relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she just wanted Nelson to grow up well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason lowered his head to look at the corner of Grace's mouth that was injured from the slap. He saw that her cheek was swollen as well. There was a trace of blood trickling down the corner of her mouth. The sight stung his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Frowning, his fingertip gently brushed across her wound. "Who did this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you here?" she asked without answering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just finished some business and happened to pass by, so I thought I'd come and see you." It was a good thing he had come to see her. If he had not come, she would have been bullied by her father and stepmother just like that. "Who hit you just now?" He repeated his question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My stepmother," said Grace. It looked like he would not stop until he got an answer. "I&rsquo;ve slapped her back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason glanced lazily at Melinda Riley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Melinda Riley felt a chill rising in her stomach. There was a sudden surge of fear in her heart. "What do you want? So what if&hellip; If I hit her? She can have her wounds examined and I'll pay for her medical expenses..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason slowly walked up to Melinda Riley and gave her a sharp slap with a thunderous wave of his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Melinda Riley was knocked to the ground. A tooth was knocked out of her mouth with blood spurting everywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hit&hellip; Hit me. You&hellip; You hit me..." Melinda Riley cried out in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked down at her coldly and said, "So what if I hit you? You can have the wounds examined and I'll pay for the medical expenses."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was handing Melinda Riley's words right back to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only problem was who would dare to ask Jason to compensate for their medical expenses?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, the police arrived. They all went to the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not get into much trouble as Jason had called his lawyer to the police station. The lawyer hired by the Reed family was naturally a famous barrister in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins and Melinda Riley were placed under administrative detention for five days for causing a disturbance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they heard they were getting detained, the couple immediately cried and screamed. However, this time, they dared not scold Grace again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace out of the police station and got into the car. He looked at the wound on her face with distress. "It seems that I should send someone to protect you at all times, lest you get hurt again by accident."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately said, "No, I only earn 4,000 dollars a month. How much do you pay the bodyguard a month for protecting me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The bodyguard's salary was several times hers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about coming to work for me?" he asked. It would be easier for him to look after her.</p></div>
