        <h1>Chapter 2326</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was wrong with him? Before leaving, he constantly told himself not to care about Kyla. Even if he had once loved this woman, it was all over now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her pale face and devastating expression kept appearing in his mind, making it hard for him to calm down. He also felt an uncomfortable tightness in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he ordered the driver to go to the hotel. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he wondered what on earth he was doing when he arrived. &lsquo;Do I want to see Kyla?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Aren't I supposed to despise this woman?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he sat in the car, two forces seemed to tug at him in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What surprised him was she appeared in front of him with another man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">According to his memories, Chase Harper was close to her when they were in Emerald City. Now, they appeared together in L City. What did she have to do with Chase Harper?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was begging him about an hour ago but was now smiling sweetly at another man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">An uncomfortable feeling crept over his heart. It was as if something was gnawing at him or stinging him. He even felt rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what was he angry about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it because she was smiling at another man like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver in the front was terrified as he felt the air pressure in the car dropping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the driver peeked at the rearview mirror, he was shocked to see a hint of anger in Martin Weiss's cold face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Mr. Weiss... mad?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss watched Kyla bid Chase Harper goodbye before walking into the hotel, while Chase Harper crossed the road to the opposite side. He ordered the driver, "Follow the man in the gray coat after this. I want to know where he's staying."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Martin Weiss got out of the car and walked into the hotel, while the driver slowly started the car and followed Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla returned to her hotel room, took off her coat, and walked wearily into the bathroom to wash up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had only been out for a few hours but felt so exhausted. Amber Mitchell's affair was like a big stone pressing on her heart, leaving her breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she met Chase Harper by chance today, and she felt better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The L City she grew up in had become strange to her, but meeting Chase Harper here and stumbling into an old friend gave her a sense of familiarity again. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled bitterly. She would have to find time to accompany Chase Harper to buy Juliet a gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of how cute Juliet was, she looked down at her bulging belly and wondered if her baby would be as cute as Juliet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it would be better if the baby was a girl. She could braid her daughter's hair and buy her pretty little dresses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson was a boy, and she always regretted not being able to dress him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla put on her nightrobe and walked out of the bathroom after washing up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stopped as soon as she got out of the bathroom. She looked blankly at Martin Weiss, who was sitting on the couch beside the coffee table. Surprise was written all over her face.</p></div>
