        <h1>Chapter 2146</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She suddenly sneered. "Bomb? You&rsquo;re calling your own child a bomb?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He said nothing but pulled her toward the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let me go. Let go!" She struggled desperately and tried to break free from his grip. She wanted to escape, but his hand clung firmly to her arm and would not let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His slender fingers were like steel bars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla panicked and opened her mouth to bite his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss frowned, while the people beside them exclaimed, "Ah, Mr. Weiss, you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The men tried to remove Kyla's mouth from Martin Weiss's hand, but Martin Weiss said, "Don't touch her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Those people instantly dared not move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Kyla and said grimly, "I'm going to abort this baby even if you bite off my hand today. Kyla, I don&rsquo;t dare to put your life at risk for that possibility!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was even more scared after seeing what had happened to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though Lina had woken up, it was just because of a small bowl of blood from the child from the Hunter family. No one could tell why that was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He never liked to rest his hopes on a small possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The child could save Lina, but that did not mean he could save Kyla if something happened to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, the reason that child saved Lina... was because of Lina's baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla trembled. She could already taste blood in her mouth. <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>It was blood from his hand when she bit it. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She made up her mind and bit harder, but he still would not let go no matter how intense the smell of blood in her mouth was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why are you..." Kyla finally let go. Martin Weiss's hand was already dripping with blood from her bite. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I told you I don&rsquo;t want to risk losing you for a baby. Even if I lose my hand today, the baby can't stay!" With that said, he carried her in his arms and walked into the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, let go of me. Let go..." She struggled harder. Every time she yelled, she felt like she was drowning in the smell of blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Martin Weiss took her to the operating room, Kyla was near despair!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, who are you to do this? Who are you to decide whether this kid stays or goes? I can sue you if you force me to abort the baby!" Kyla shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sue me then. I don't care how many years I have to be in prison!" he said. All he wanted was for her to be safe and sound. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, he turned and said to the doctors and nurses who were already waiting, "Operate on her. I'll take responsibility if anything happens."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctors and nurses then carried Kyla over and pressed her onto the operating table while the anesthesiologist began to prepare the anesthetic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was forced to lie on the operating table, and she felt a chill sweeping over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Am I going to lose the baby? In this way too?'</p></div>
