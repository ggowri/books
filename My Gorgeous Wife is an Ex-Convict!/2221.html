        <h1>Chapter 2219</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at him coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid only felt a chill in his body and hurriedly said, "Well... We happened to catch Miss Corbyn dining here today, so we thought we could dine together. Knowing that Miss Corbyn is your friend, we thought we could have a meal together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman also said quickly, "Mr. Weiss, I'm Kyla's friend. I helped Kyla out a lot in the past. I was reunited with Kyla by chance, so I invited her to a meal together. I wanted the gathering to be livelier, so I asked her to invite you over. I didn't expect you to really come. Come, come. Have a seat, Mr. Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman said as she pulled out the chair next to Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss did not sit down and just said, "Who was the one who said they could make Kyla drink and I wouldn&rsquo;t say a word? I didn't hear very well from outside. I wonder if I missed out on anything else besides this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert looked embarrassed. He immediately got up and said with a smile, "It's a misunderstanding. It's just a misunderstanding. I just wanted to hype up the atmosphere and propose a toast to Miss Corbyn!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A toast?" Martin Weiss sneered. "Kyla's pregnant, so she can't drink. I'm injured, and the doctor told me not to drink for a while. How about this? I'll have one of my men drink with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Martin Weiss glanced at a bodyguard standing next to him, who promptly poured a glass of wine into an empty glass and downed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, we've drunk your toast, so I'll make one to you too!" said Martin Weiss as he indifferently instructed his bodyguard. "Let him drink more, lest I appear stingy. Today's drinks are all on me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!" The bodyguard replied in acknowledgment and walked up to Mr. Lambert with a bottle of wine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Lambert instantly felt uneasy. "Martin Weiss, what are you trying to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What am I trying to do? I&rsquo;m making a toast to you, of course!" Martin Weiss said coldly. Then, the bodyguard shoved the mouth of the bottle right into Mr. Lambert's mouth. Mr. Lambert was forced to drink. The wine was soon all over his face. Even the collar of his shirt was wet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid and the other two men looked at each other, their eyes full of shock. No one expected Martin Weiss to disregard all niceties so quickly and do something so forceful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mister&hellip; Mr. Weiss, why did you do that? It's just a misunderstanding. We only asked you to drink out of kindness. Mr. Lambert heard that Weiss Group seems to want to start some projects in Emerald City recently, so he wanted to have a meal with you and have a good chat. Mr. Lambert is familiar with both the police and triads in Emerald City. He has a lot of contacts. Wouldn't it be nice if you could cooperate?" said Neal Reid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are many people in Emerald City who want to cooperate with the Weiss family, but you're the first who dared to make me come over using such a method. I'm going to make things clear. If anyone dares to hold Kyla captive to make me come over, then they're making themselves my enemy!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He spoke so imposingly that Neal Reid and the rest were instantly shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way Jacqueline Bowman looked at Kyla was even filled with a tinge of envy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was much more powerful than Neal Reid. His handsome appearance and lean, tall figure exuded the charm of a mature man. He was unlike Neal Reid, who was fat, middle-aged, and had a big belly. She would not have hooked up with Neal Reid if it had not been for money!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, the way Martin Weiss protected Kyla gave others the illusion that Kyla was a treasure nobody could touch.</p></div>
