        <h1>Chapter 1256</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who... Who's trying to harm me?" Stella fumed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager said, "Many people are jealous of you because of the resources Young Master Hart gave you." Besides, Stella often offended people! If it were not for the fact that she had the crown prince behind her, she would be so miserable right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The manager disdained Stella. If it were not for the crown prince, he would never even have bothered with an actress like Stella! She did not have the looks nor the acting skills. She even lacked social graces and had a low EQ. She always behaved like a nouveau riche, wanting people to flatter her. She would use the crown prince to oppress others when things did not go her way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the manager was not that sincere in helping Stella now that this was happening!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you talk to Young Master Hart and ask him to help you take it off the trending list?" the manager said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This suffering Stella was going through could not be easily described. If she could find Brian, would she be listening to the manager's nonsense? The trending post would have been long gone! Therefore, she could only mumble, "I'll... look for him later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the call was over, Stella was so angry that she trembled and slammed her phone to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those wanting to see her make a joke of herself could just wait and see. It was her birthday party tomorrow, and Brian would be there! She wanted those people to open their eyes wide and see that she was the most glamorous person!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a quiet room, Brian looked at the documents his subordinates gave him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Hart, this is the information we've found. Miss Cummins did develop a fever shortly after you were hospitalized. She was sent to the hospital in Emerald City. According to that year's medical records, she had many scratches and bruises on her body when she had a fever. The hospital even called the police as they suspected that Miss Cummins was abused. The police were able to find the relevant files."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes were fixed on a photo in the file. It was a photo of the injuries on the little girl's body that the police had taken so they could use it as evidence if it was indeed abuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the photo, the little girl had two large bruises on her knee, including an obvious scratch on her left knee. Although it was no longer bleeding, the new skin that had grown after was still a shocking sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even after all these years and though the old photo had yellowed, the injuries on the little girl's knees were still vivid in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes turned red. 'The scar... It's her. It's really her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had gotten those injuries when she stumbled and fell to her knees again and again while carrying him on her back through the thick forest!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, he had said, "Stop carrying me. Put me down. I... I can walk by myself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your leg hurts so much that you can't even walk. How can you walk by yourself? I'll be fine. I'm strong, so I'm sure I can carry you down the hill!" She had spoken with feigned nonchalance. Even though one of her knees was grazed and covered with blood, she said nothing and never complained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was indeed strong enough to carry him down the hill and met adults there. It was then that he found out her knee was covered with blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry..." he had said as he wept. It was as if he did not know what else to say other than that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't cry! It just looks scary. It doesn't hurt that much." She comforted him as she wiped his tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could the little girl... be Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why did I mistake her for someone else?'</p></div>
