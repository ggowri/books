        <h1>Chapter 3117</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber could still see Valda walking with a limp without showing any surprise, but Simon exclaimed, "Auntie Valda, what happened to your foot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Valda could respond, Brian spoke up, "Your Auntie Valda hurt her foot, so she's having some trouble walking. But don't worry, I'll find a way to help her heal and get better."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You must make Auntie Valda's foot better quickly. If you can't do it, I'll go find my dad to help Auntie Valda's foot heal faster," said Simon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You don't have to worry about this, Dad!" Brian said, picking up Valda and striding forward with big steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" Valda exclaimed softly, saying, "I... I can walk by myself." Besides, Amber and Simon are still nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The doctor said to try to walk as little as possible these days, right? So during these days, I'll be your legs," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She bit her lip slightly, blushing but didn't say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Simon, on the other hand, caught up and grumbled, "Hmph, when I grow up, I can also carry Auntie Valda!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You, wait another 800 years." Brian said bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When they arrived at Valda's apartment, Valda, Amber, and Simon were sitting on the sofa in the living room. Brian, on the other hand, went straight to the kitchen and started boiling water, making tea, and pouring drinks for everyone. Amber was a bit surprised by how familiar Brian was with the routine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, who would have thought that the prince of the entertainment industry would actually be doing these things in a small apartment?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, looking at the prince's familiarity with the kitchen setup, it's clear that this isn't his first time doing something like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Simon anxiously asked Valda where she had been all these days, so Valda recounted her experiences during her disappearance to the little guy once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, since she was talking to a child, she downplayed many of the plot points and instead focused on some interesting things in the village where she lived at the time. For example, she talked about rice fields, seedlings, and the stove, and how to start a fire. These were things that city children don't usually come into contact with. Simon was very interested in listening and thought that Valda was having a great time there!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I want to go to that village to play next time," said Simon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, next time I'll take you with me if there's a chance," Valda smiled and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber looked at Valda with a gaze filled with pity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pain that Valda went through was likely unbearable for most people. Now, the fact that the other person can safely return to Emerald City can truly be considered lucky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Simon is a child who naturally can't sit still. He runs around the room after only a short while. At first, he wants to visit Valda's apartment, and then he says he wants to go to the supermarket to fill Valda's empty fridge with food. He's afraid that Valda will go hungry because there's nothing to eat in the fridge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So Brian turned to Valda and Amber and said, "I'll take him to the nearby supermarket to buy some things. We'll grab some lunch ingredients and have a quick meal here later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it's not too convenient..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Amber was still speaking, Simon interrupted and said, "Great, great! I'll have lunch with Auntie Valda and buy lots and lots of delicious food from the supermarket!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber looked helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda smiled and said, "Sure, I haven't had dinner with Simon in a long time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Simon excitedly followed Brian out the door and went to the supermarket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber looked at Valda and said, "You're really strong, Valda."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda replied, "Actually, you're stronger than me."</p></div>
