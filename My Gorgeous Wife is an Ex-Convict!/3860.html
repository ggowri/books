        <h1>Chapter 3858</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace touched Veronica's head, knowing that there were some things this child had to digest on her own.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The law will judge fairly, and everyone has to take responsibility for what they have done," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Soon, it was the day of Daniel's trial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the trial was not open to the public, it still attracted a large number of reporters. These reporters had been waiting outside the courthouse early in the morning, just waiting for the Reed family to appear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, in Emerald City, anything related to the Reed family could become big news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at the crowd of reporters outside the car, feeling a little nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't be afraid, stay by my side later," Mason said beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the car stopped and the door opened, Mason held Veronica's hand and walked towards the main entrance of the courthouse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The surrounding reporters kept surging forward, but fortunately, they were stopped by the Reed family's bodyguards, the courthouse security personnel, and the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica followed Mason's footsteps and walked forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His hand was warm, and she looked straight at his broad back, as if as long as she followed him, she wouldn't have to be afraid of anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside the courtroom, it was much quieter than outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just stick to the facts when you answer the questions later. If you're not sure, you can choose not to answer," Mason reminded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I know," Veronica replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before this, Auntie Grace had already told her what kind of questions might be asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, if they asked about Daniel's motive for the crime, it was inevitable that they would bring up their high school days. Her relationship with Daniel as his ex-girlfriend, and the fact that Mason had given Daniel a large sum of money to break up with her, would all be mentioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This made Veronica a little nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she had realized her true feelings earlier and hadn't dated Daniel, then none of this would have happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In court, Veronica saw Daniel again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked similar to when she saw him in the detention center, but he appeared slightly cleaner and tidier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In court, Daniel kept his head down and obediently answered the judge's questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, in his answers, he didn't intend to harm Veronica, he just wanted to scare them, and he didn't know there would be such dangerous consequences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for his motive, Daniel naturally revealed everything that happened in high school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But on this issue, he always saw himself as a victim, feeling that he was being used by Veronica and Mason, and that they had disrupted his life and led him down this path of no return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When it was Veronica's turn to answer the judge's questions, she answered them truthfully. When the defense lawyer asked if what Daniel said about their past was true, Veronica's lawyer stood up and protested, saying that this question was irrelevant to the case and Veronica didn't need to answer it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, no matter what happened between the three of them during high school, it is an undeniable fact that Daniel committed a crime and intends to kill someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the end, Veronica doesn't need to answer this question.</p></div>
