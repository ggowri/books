        <h1>Chapter 4238 No Regrets</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like sharp needles constantly pricking at her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It turns out that Kit, this person, still caused her pain!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The online discussion about Kit's disability became a hot topic, but it only lasted half a day before people started to cool down the topic. Some speculated that it was Kit or his fans who intentionally cooled down the topic.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Kit no longer cared about how others discussed him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>One arm was useless, he couldn't even perform simple lifting movements, and his fingers couldn't even grip anything.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, all he had left was this body, and at least his body was still relatively healthy. But now, even this body had flaws!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Fortunately, when he met Tina, his body was still fine, at least letting Tina see the good side of him.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was doing rehabilitation at the hospital's rehabilitation center. The doctors said that with rehabilitation, his arm and fingers might regain some functionality, at least being able to lift a little and grip simple objects.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, he only had his left arm intact!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he had no regrets about his hand becoming like this to save Tina.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As long as Tina was safe and sound...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Kit returned to the apartment, he saw his father sitting on the sofa.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was normal, his father also had a key to the apartment. After he came back, he didn't change the locks, so naturally his father could come in.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How pathetic!" Edmond mocked as soon as he saw Kit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit remained indifferent. He had long been used to his father's ridicule.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he didn't expect his father to suddenly appear in front of him again. "Do you need something?" he asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you regret it?" Edmond continued, "For a woman, you gave up your career, searched everywhere for her, and now you've become disabled. Do you regret it?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's nothing to regret. It was my own choice," Kit said with a faint smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, he never regretted it in his heart!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're still being stubborn?" Edmond frowned displeased. "Do you think your savings are enough for your rehabilitation treatment and future livelihood? As a disabled person, how will you earn a living?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's my own business, you don't need to worry about it!" Kit said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was well aware that his father had no fatherly affection for him, only exploitation.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I weren't your father, do you think I would want to interfere in your affairs?" Edmond said angrily. "I can offer you a way out now. If you just listen to me and behave, you can live a good life."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Edmond spoke, he placed a contract in front of Kit.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is a contract I drafted for you. There's a widow who owns a business, living alone now that her children are grown. She's looking for someone obedient and willing to be by her side. She saw you before and found you attractive, despite your disability. If you're willing to accompany her for three years, she'll give you 50 million dollars after that. With that kind of money, your future can be very promising."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Edmond pretended to have Kit's best interests at heart.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Kit found it laughable. "So what do you gain from all this, </span><span>dad</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you saying?" Edmond responded angrily.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If there's no benefit for you, </span><span>you</span><span> wouldn't have come to me," Kit said coldly, staring at his father.</span></p></div>
