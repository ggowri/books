        <h1>Chapter 1138</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After hearing the word &lsquo;Grace&rsquo;, Jason, who was not far away, suddenly stopped and looked in the direction of Grace and Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence, who was standing next to Jason, also heard it and looked in the same direction. He quickly turned to his boss who was next to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason just looked indifferently at Grace who was on the ground. There was no change on his handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Come on," he said lightly before walking down the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the place where Grace fell was not far from the steps, Jason had to pass by Grace if he wanted to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment, those pilgrims who were outside the temple had all entered the temple hall by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was empty outside, and Grace subconsciously looked up as the sound of footsteps came closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only see a figure coming toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked up and looked at him blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not the same as the fleeting glance she had taken when he walked out of the temple hall. He was coming nearer and nearer to her, and she could see him more and more clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His cold face and delicate features were the same, except that his expression no longer held the gentle longing he previously had for her, nor the broken beauty he showed when she left the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was only indifference left. His eyes never fell on her. It was as if she could never enter those peach blossom eyes again, and she no longer existed in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shuddered when his footsteps passed her, but Jason never looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, are you... okay?" Lina quickly picked up her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm okay." Grace shook her head, bent down, and gently brushed off the dust from her fall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Out of the corner of her eye, she once again caught a glimpse of Jason's figure as he walked down the steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That&hellip; was the most unreachable figure in Emerald City, but the figure had once knelt at her feet, saying that he was willing to give her everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, she was the one who pushed his everything away with her own hands. She was the one who fell on her knees and begged him to let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she really would not have anything to do with him anymore!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However&hellip; This was the result she wanted, but why was there a bitter feeling welling up inside her? It slowly spread from her mouth to her whole body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since&hellip; we can go in now, let's go in." Grace took a deep breath and walked toward the temple hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina sighed and turned her head to look at Jason who was surrounded by bodyguards. He had gone far. She raised her hand and hit her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had known that Jason would be here today, she would not have brought Grace here! She really knew how to pick a day!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina blamed herself and quickly followed her best friend into the temple hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was only one Buddha statue in this temple hall, and the stately Buddha statue seemed to be compassionate to all living beings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was not a Buddhist, but she was now reverently clasping her hands in front of the Buddha statue, respectfully closing her eyes and bowing.</p></div>
