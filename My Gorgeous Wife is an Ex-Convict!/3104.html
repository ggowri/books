        <h1>Chapter 3102</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille began to act as a military advisor, "So, you need to take advantage of the time you have alone with Valda and quickly get her done!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think it's that easy?" Brian said unkindly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille used to think that Brian was quite distant, after all, he was a prince, and she was very nervous in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But over the past year, her impression of Brian has changed somewhat. She talks to him, and she doesn't feel as nervous as she used to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, she even feels sorry for Brian. Even if he is a high and mighty prince, so what? He still has times when he is powerless, times when he is no better than an ordinary person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Like... when it comes to getting Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it were someone else, it might really be difficult, but if it's you, it shouldn't be too difficult," Camille said, looking up and down at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you have any good ideas?" Brian asked humbly for Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brother, with your outrageously handsome looks and Valda being so smitten with your face, why not use your charm to win her over? Don't tell me you're afraid of not being able to handle Valda even with your good looks." Camille said with a frustrated expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's thin lips were tightly pursed. He had used this tactic before. That one time, he took advantage of her when she was half-resisting and half-consenting, while he was drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night, he almost used all his tricks to make her fall for him again, to the point where she couldn't bear to lose him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night, things between them were clearly wonderful, but the next day, everything seemed to have returned to square one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You must make good use of your face, that's all I have to say!" said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's thin lips tightened even more. If his face could really captivate Valda, he didn't mind doing whatever it takes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Valda finished viewing the house, she said goodbye to the agent and the three of them went to a restaurant to have a meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda asked Camille, "What do you think of the house we just saw?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's pretty good. Your requirements are all met, and the lighting is good too. The yard is also spacious. In the same area, the cost performance is considered good. However, the total price is a bit high at 4.2 million, which is not a small amount," Camille said candidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It is a considerable amount, but I can take out a loan. For a second property, I can get a loan of up to 40%, which means I only need around 2.6 million. That should be enough," said Valda. "I've earned some money from my writing over the years, and I can also mortgage my current property to get a loan."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If it's about the same, I can lend it to you. I have a few hundred thousand on hand..." Camille's words were interrupted by Brian's sharp gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille felt uneasy, the prince was not happy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't think this house is good. It's too small, old, and the community environment is not great," Brian criticized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After all, we have a budget of around 4 million. It's already rare to find a house like this," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Camille agreed, but was met with another sharp look from Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille immediately shut her mouth obediently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, if you don't want to move into my villa but still want a two-bedroom house, I can prepare one for you. You can move in directly without buying it yourself," Brian offered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can buy it myself. I don't need to live in your house," Valda declined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's face darkened. He felt like she was desperately trying to distance herself from him. "Why do you have to be so clear-cut? I can give you everything, anything!" Including himself!</p></div>
