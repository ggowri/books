        <h1>Chapter 3783</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your family made a lot of money before relying on your relationship with the Reed family. If I were still your boyfriend, they would certainly help us."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But as you can see, I'm working hard to support myself while studying at university. They haven't helped me. "</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because you don't want to accept the Reed family's assistance. The Reed family is willing to help you..." Daniel said, but suddenly his voice stopped, and the rest of his words were swallowed back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica stared at Daniel. "How do you know that the Reed family is willing to help me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I'm just guessing. After all, your relationship with the Reed family has always been good. I heard that you moved out of your house after breaking up with Mason and lived alone. You must have had a falling out with your family, and the Reed family couldn't just ignore you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although Daniel's explanation was reasonable, Veronica still felt a sense of unease in his voice, and he tried to avoid her gaze when he said these things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, Daniel knowing these things was probably not just because of his simple guesswork. There must be something else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if you didn't break up with me for that money back then, we would still have broken up in the future." Veronica looked directly at him and said, "I did like you back then, but looking back now, that liking also had a sense of escape, because I wanted to avoid the person I liked more, so I chose to date you, who I had feelings for."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The person you liked more? Is it Mason? Did you date me just to use me?" Daniel's expression changed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I never thought of using you. I dated you back then because I genuinely liked you, but I also genuinely wanted to avoid my feelings for Mason, because I was afraid of breaking the peace of my past life and afraid that my relationship with him would change in some way. So subconsciously, I might have chosen you because I felt safer with you." Veronica explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was also her recent understanding of her past feelings.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha ha, just because I'm safer, you've turned my life into a mess like this?" Daniel's voice was sharp.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to wake up your mother?" Veronica glanced at the old Mrs. Cross who was still sleeping, then said, "Let's go outside and talk, don't disturb your mother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel didn't argue and the two of them walked out of the ward. After leaving the hospital, Veronica stopped and turned to Daniel. "If you think that my decision to date you was the beginning of all your troubles, then I apologize. If your mother's medical expenses are not enough, I can help you figure out a solution. But I hope you can stop dwelling on the past and move on. That way, your life will have more possibilities."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel sneered, "More possibilities? What are you kidding? My life has already been ruined by Mason. What other possibilities are there?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But it was a fact that your father embezzled public funds. Mason used this to break us up, but it was you who made the choice to take the money, wasn't it? Why blame others for a choice you made?" Veronica stared at Daniel.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt sorry for the old Mrs. Cross after seeing her condition earlier.</span></p></div>
