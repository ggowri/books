        <h1>Chapter 479</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Great. Fortunately, you look different now," muttered Jason. He did not want that woman to have Grace&rsquo;s face on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was good that they both looked alike as... children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's eyelashes fluttered a little, and he lowered his eyes. His long eyelashes covered the thoughts and calculations that were going on in his eyes at that moment...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason and Grace stayed for dinner. When it was getting dark toward the evening, Grace&rsquo;s grandfather, Old Mr. Kelleigh, returned. Nevertheless, he was indifferent towards Grace and even worse toward Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was no stranger to his attitude. However, seeing her grandfather's attitude toward Jason, she looked at the latter with some concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, because of his Jason's status, few people dared treat him that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nonetheless, Jason only smiled at Grace as if he could sense her concern. He gave a look that suggested she need not worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a relief to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During dinner, her grandmother was quite happy and had a better appetite than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While eating, Stella Lindsay could not help but say in a tone full of sarcasm, "Hey, Grandpa, do you know that Grace left the Sanitation Service Center and is now working as a food delivery rider? Although working as a food delivery rider is a little tiring, it seems that if you work hard, you can earn some money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's there to be said about being a rider? Isn't she ashamed that she has ended up as an errand girl after so many years of studying?" Old Mr. Kelleigh snorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face paled a little upon hearing that. However, her grandmother spoke up for her, "What are you talking about, old man? Grace is independent and does not steal or rob. What is there to be ashamed of?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Had I known that she would end up like this, would I have let her study so much? It would have been better if she began working early like Stella," said Old Mr. Kelleigh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay took the opportunity to say, "Hey, I thought you would make a difference and bring honor to the family, Grace. Who knew a law student like you would deliberately break the law, drinking and driving? Don't do such a thing again. We were humiliated enough the last time you went to prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grandma clearly looked angry. Grace, fearing that her grandmother's anger would affect her body, quickly smoothed things over. Fully aware that Stella Lindsay was mocking her, she smiled and said, "I've learned my lesson. Why wouldn&rsquo;t I remember?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having beat Grace verbally, Stella Lindsay felt rather triumphant. However, just then, another voice rang, "I don't think there's anything to be ashamed of. By living an independent life, she&rsquo;s more dignified than a lot of people."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said as he looked at Grace with doting eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This made Stella Lindsay jealous again. What was so great about Grace? It seemed as if the man only had Grace in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace might have been an elite lawyer in the past, but she was only someone who had been to prison now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay could not figure out what Jason saw in Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace met Jason's haze and felt a sense of warmth inside. The man would stand up for her anytime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grandma witnessed it and was secretly pleased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was going to leave after one meal. However, before she left, she said reluctantly, "Grandma, when you get better, I'll take you to Emerald City to taste some of the local specialties there."</p></div>
