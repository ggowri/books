        <h1>Chapter 740</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who is it? Who's blacklisting me?" she asked bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she heard the name from her manager's mouth, her face paled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The one who wanted to blacklist her was Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason had never been interested in the entertainment industry. He had never picked on any celebrity in the entertainment industry before, and now... This was the first time he did so!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the reason... Lily's mind went back to the time at the fair when she humbly apologized to Grace and asked for forgiveness, but Grace refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later, Jason even said, &lsquo;If she won't forgive you, then no.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She suspected Jason would do something later on, but she did not expect him to blacklist her in the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was almost Jason's sister-in-law in name!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Jason never loved her sister, the Reed family and the Atkinson family were somehow related to each other from an outsider's perspective.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If word got around that she was blacklisted by Jason, then she would be embarrassed in front of everyone and become a joke in high society!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Jason... Going to go that far for Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily's eyes glinted with hatred. However, before doing anything else, she had to solve this immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Lily hurried back to the Atkinson family's house and told her parents about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her father, Harold, frowned and fell silent while her mother, Camelia Meyer, was unwilling to see her daughter suffer such a problem. She immediately jumped up. "Jason is way out of line. He tore down our shopping mall and now he's trying to destroy Lily's career?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camelia Meyer got more and more infuriated as she spoke. She was ready to take her bag and talk some sense into Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily quickly stopped her mother, knowing that her mother was impulsive. The only person in her family who could solve her problems was her father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now Jason is at the peak of his interest in Grace. He's just angry that I vilified Grace and did something against Grace when she was in prison, so now he's standing up for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily said aggrievedly, "I'm willing to apologize to Grace. I even apologized in person. I... Can take responsibility for the wrong I've done, but I really don't want my career that I've worked so hard for to be ruined just like that.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily became emotional. Her eyes were red, and her shoulders twitched slightly. Her tears were almost pouring out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Qirong, do you want to see your daughter's years of hard work destroyed? Also, if word about this gets out, how is she going to face the public? She&rsquo;d be despised by her husband's family when she marries into the Stevens family!" Camelia Meyer was eager to stand up for her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold finally sighed and said to the mother and daughter, "All right. I'll call Jason and see if there's room for negotiation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily immediately breathed a sigh of relief. When her father said so, there was likely still room to turn the matter around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Harold took out his phone and dialed Jason's number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, the call got through, and Harold exchanged pleasantries before jumping straight to the point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know Lily has done some things she shouldn't have, so it's only normal that you would want to stand up for her, Mr. Reed. However, Lily has been in the entertainment industry for so many years, and she has put a lot of effort into it. I, as a father, can&rsquo;t bear to see her years of work go wasted. Why don't I take the piece of land in the south of the city as an apology and give it to Miss Cummins? What do you think of this, Young Master Reed?"</p></div>
