        <h1>Chapter 2636</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll find out the answer!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace video-called Kyla, asking how her ankle injury was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've almost recovered," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you and Martin Weiss?" Grace asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're still the same. He doesn't want to accept me, so maybe we'll end up getting divorced," muttered Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suggested, "Why don't we try and see how we can dehypnotize him? We could find a good hypnotist to do reverse hypnosis. I've looked into some cases, and there have been some successful cases."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla shook her head. "No thanks. He's the one who doesn't want to get rid of the hypnosis. He knows the secret password and can get rid of the hypnosis himself at any time. He's unwilling to do it because he doesn't want to love me anymore. In that case, there's no need to force him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you..." Grace said with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm mentally prepared. We&rsquo;ve missed out on so many things. If he really doesn't have feelings for me by the time we&rsquo;ve agreed on, I'll sign the divorce papers. I'm willing to respect his choice," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know how to comfort her for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it was hard for outsiders to get involved in relationships.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you? How&rsquo;s your pregnancy going?" Kyla asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Everything's fine. I'm doing alright for every pregnancy check-up," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good. I haven&rsquo;t been in Emerald City recently. I heard from my mom that you, Lina, and Amber Mitchell often visit her and my two children. You even provided a lot of help. Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're the children's godmother. Their mother isn&rsquo;t around, so of course, we're going to visit them more often," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled gratefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unable to sleep after the call, Kyla walked out of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was already quite late, and there was no servant around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She walked over to the kitchen, wanting to look for something to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not eat much at dinner today, so she was slightly hungry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The fridge was well stocked. Kyla planned to make tomato and egg noodles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she turned around, she saw a tall figure standing in the kitchen doorway staring at her after she took out the ingredients.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" She was so startled that she almost dropped the ingredient in her hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla asked after calming herself down, "What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at the woman in front of him. "I should be the one to ask you that. What are you doing in the kitchen?" he said and glanced at the ingredients in her hand. "You didn't eat enough for dinner?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm a little hungry, so I wanted something to eat," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you're hungry, just dial the internal phone and ask the cook to come and make you something to eat," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They must have gone to rest. It's too much trouble to ask them to come again in the middle of the night. It won't take much time for me to cook some noodles," she said as she went to the kitchen countertop to wash the vegetables. Then, she boiled the water to cook the noodles. At the same time, she took the kitchen knife and quickly cut the tomatoes before breaking the eggs...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could feel his eyes on her even though she had her back to him.</p></div>
