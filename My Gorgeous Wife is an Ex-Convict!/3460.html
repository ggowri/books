        <h1>Chapter 3458</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm telling you guys, stop dreaming big and thinking you can still get our goods at such a low price. We used to give you business and sell to you at a much lower wholesale price than others. But let's be real, it's not because you're good at doing business. It's because we were basically giving money to the Barlow family. Don't you have any shame? Now, you still want to buy our goods at such a low price. Do you really think we're fools?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer was so angry that he was shaking all over. "We'll see what happens in the future. Don't come begging to me on your knees!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is that possible!" the other person sneered, "Mason has already returned to the Reed family for a year. It won't be long before he completely cuts ties with your Barlow family. Then, you won't have a chance to use Mason again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What use is there? There is no blood relationship between Mason and us!" said Archer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person laughed even harder, "This kind of talk can only fool children. Archer, what kind of person are you? We've known each other for so many years, don't I know you? You've been doing business for so many years, haven't you used Mason and the Reed family's name to your advantage? I wonder how you'll end up in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer's face turned red and then white, wanting to argue but unable to find a way to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica pulled Mason to sneak around from the other side and did not get involved in the argument.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When there was no one around, she finally stopped walking, let go of Mason's hand, and said, "I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why apologize?" asked Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I... our family towards you..." Veronica struggled to continue, as she understood the unpleasant truth but couldn't prevent it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Barlow family has always been using Mason and the Reed family to seek the greatest benefits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Otherwise, with his father's business acumen, he simply didn't have the ability to bring the business to where it is today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know," said Mason, his voice ringing out and causing Veronica to suddenly startle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I know the Barlow family has been using me. I know that over the years, your parents have been using the name of the Reed family to gain various benefits," said Mason calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt embarrassed for a moment. She had thought that Mason might not be fully aware of these things because of his young age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he already knew everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But even if I know, what difference does it make?" said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was taken aback, and only heard him continue speaking, "As long as I can stay by Veronica's side, even if I am being used, what does it matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this world, everything requires a cost to be paid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he, simply stayed by her side, so he paid a price that he didn't care about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Veronica was suddenly overwhelmed with complex emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do I need to say hello to those relatives? It could have given business to the Barlow family, and they would naturally return the favor," said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica shook her head and said, "No need, this is good enough. The Barlow family has already used you enough!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't care," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I care!" said Veronica. "I don't want the Barlow family to become parasites of the Reed family, and I don't want to become your parasite in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Parasites can only survive by attaching themselves to a host. Once they detach from the host, they are unable to survive independently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I used to think that you were relying on me, but gradually I realized that it was actually me who was relying on you. The entire Barlow family is relying on you!" Veronica took a deep breath and continued, "But Mason, things shouldn't be this way. No one can rely on anyone forever. Everyone is an independent individual, so you shouldn't be used anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's eyelashes trembled slightly, but being used means having value. However, does this mean that he no longer holds any value in her heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, does she no longer need him to be by her side?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A gentle breeze blew over the two of them as they looked at each other, but their thoughts were different.</p></div>
