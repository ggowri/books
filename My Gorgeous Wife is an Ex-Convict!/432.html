        <h1>Chapter 431</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She held her breath. &lsquo;Does his current expression mean that&hellip; he was angry?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You said that you want to be independent and you want to continue to work as a helper at the small restaurant because you don&rsquo;t want to rely on me. Fine, there is nothing wrong with that.&rdquo; He took in a deep breath. &ldquo;But even a regular boyfriend should be able to give his girlfriend anything he wants, right? Do you even treat me as your boyfriend?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lips and could not find a reply to his questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Grace, I know that you don&rsquo;t want to rely on me, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you need to reject the things I give you,&rdquo; Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to give her a good life. He did not want her to be worked up over even a single penny. Although he knew that her actions were based on her past experience with him, he still could not help but feel this way. Some things needed a long time to change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, the anger within his chest that he tried hard to suppress still erupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only problem was that his anger was more toward himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had not allowed things to progress the way it did and if only he was willing to give the justice she wanted, she would not have ended up this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had destroyed what used to be her life. He turned her from a lawyer with a bright future to someone with a criminal record. He pushed her to experience life&rsquo;s perils that she now had to calculate prudently each penny she earned to make sure she had enough for the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath and said to Jason, &ldquo;Okay, I understand. Then please buy me some hair ties.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">To be honest, she was indeed too calculative with him at times. She was afraid that she would make the same mistake as she did with her ex. She did not want to be a parasite that only took, thus she wanted to do it all with her own strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, they were now boyfriend and girlfriend. She did not need to be so calculative with him over small items. If she continued to be so calculative, it would only widen the distance between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason then pulled Grace to look at other stalls that sold hair accessories. However, nothing caught Jason&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, he took her to a hair accessory shop inside the shopping mall adjacent to the Food Fest Street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a look and noticed that a regular black hair tie without any trinket already cost 50 dollars here. Although the quality was good, it was still expensive for a hair tie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took a few glances and realized that there was no better choice. Thus, he reluctantly said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take this. Give me ten of it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Ten?&rdquo; Grace got a shock. Ten of them would cost 500 dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you want to buy ten earlier at the street stall?&rdquo; he asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s because it cost 5 bucks for ten pieces, so it&rsquo;s cheaper than buying a single piece.&rsquo; That was why she usually bought ten in a go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after some time, Jason felt that merely buying these ten hair ties was not enough. He asked the shop assistant to choose a few more hair accessories. &ldquo;Do you see anything that you like?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every girl had a secret spot for beautiful things. Grace naturally liked these hair accessories. However&hellip; &ldquo;These are too expensive. Besides, I don&rsquo;t have much opportunity to wear these because of my job.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Usually, one needed to put on some nice makeup with matching clothes to use such hair accessories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll just have to create the opportunity for you to be able to use them. As for the price, you can only have such concerns when the price of the item I want to buy for you is half of my wealth.&rdquo;</p></div>
