        <h1>Chapter 3602</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just with this sensational title, it has attracted a lot of people to click on it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at the displayed number of views, and it was already very high! It seems that quite a few people have read this post!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And when she clicked on the post, the content inside was even more detailed and sensational than she imagined!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this post, it even directly states that William's mother is Lily, a former popular star, and it was Lily who framed Jasper's mother, causing Grace to be wrongly imprisoned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, William was just the son of a criminal, and everyone despised him, but now, he has transformed into a campus prince charming and is admired by many girls.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What's even more absurd is that William has actually become good friends with Jasper, the heiress of the Reed family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This post speculates maliciously whether William intentionally became "good friends" with Jasper, because in the past, Lily was arrested and died in prison due to the Reed family's involvement. It suggests that William is befriending Jasper only to strike a heavy blow in the future and seek revenge on the Reed family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper trembled with anger as she looked at this post!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This post is simply attacking William with the utmost malice, and there are many uninformed gossipers in the comments who also maliciously speculate and agree with the sentiments expressed in the post. They even imagine a revenge plot in a wealthy family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper, what's written in this post..." Meave whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's all nonsense!" Jasper exclaimed, quickly dialing William's number.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it only showed that the other person's phone was switched off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper frowned, wondering if William's phone was out of battery or if he deliberately turned it off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that she had already seen the post, William must have seen it too. What would he think?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Meave, could you please take my textbooks back to the dorm for me? I won't be going back there for now," Jasper said, handing her the books and rushing off.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hey, Jasper!" Meave wanted to say something else, but Jasper was already far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, is the post really nonsense?" Meave muttered, but as she looked closer, it seemed to have some truth to it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If William's mother really had some grudge or conflict with the Reed family, then in Meave's opinion, Jasper should be cautious around William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, it's better to be safe than sorry!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>... Since Jasper couldn't reach William on the phone, she decided to call her older brother Mick instead.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Bro, can you help me hack into Stanford University's school forum temporarily?" Jasper got straight to the point.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hack your own school's forum?" Mick paused, "What happened?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's a post on the forum that talks about our family and William's mother, and it says that William approached me to avenge his mother!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Initially, she just wanted her brother to take down the post. But thinking that there might be similar posts in the near future, she decided to have her brother hack the forum for extra security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Mick was also surprised, "Does William have enemies at Stanford University?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not sure, at least not on the surface," Jasper said, "Anyway, help me hack the forum first. I'll go find William, maybe he knows what's going on."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then," Mick replied readily.</span></p></div>
