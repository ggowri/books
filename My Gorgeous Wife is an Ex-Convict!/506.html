        <h1>Chapter 505</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at the man in front of her. If her idea of Jason's influence in Emerald City had only been a rumor before, it seemed to be a more concrete impression now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was the demolition of a big shopping mall after all. Even if he had something to do with it, he probably went through a lot to do it. Otherwise, how could the Atkinson family be so willing to demolish it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did all of this just because she was humiliated by the Atkinson family in the mall that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought that he had stood up for her by slapping Camelia Meyer when the Atkinson family came to apologize. She did not expect him to do more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" she asked breathlessly, her nose feeling a little sore somehow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because of you," he replied. Those four simple words seemed to contain thousands of words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was the reason he had done it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because she was the one he guarded with great care. He could not bear to hurt her himself. How could he allow others to hurt her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, this way, the Atkinson family will know better than to offend you again," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a wry smile. "Maybe only when I reverse the case will they believe that the car accident was not my fault, and it was someone else who hurt their daughter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, she could sense that someone was behind the accident. At first, she thought it was because of Jennifer Atkinson's improper driving that the accident happened, but with all those testimonies and material evidence against her, she felt that someone was manipulating all this behind the scenes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, there was another kind of possibility. Maybe the Atkinson family thought she killed their daughter, but the evidence was not enough to declare her guilty, so they bribed the witnesses and planted evidence. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, all of these were only her speculations. There was no evidence to prove it. The only witness they found so far had not provided any good leads.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll clear your name," whispered Jason with his eyes lowered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled, and her expression looked relaxed. Yes, she was not alone. He and Lina were helping her. Lina had even asked Hadwin to help her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must reverse the case!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, accompany me to a banquet tomorrow," Jason said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. "Me?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who else if not you? Aren't you my girlfriend? Isn't it normal to accompany me to a banquet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was true, but she... Grace somehow felt uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The banquets he attended probably had a lot of well-known socialites, and she... had accompanied Sean to some banquets back then. She had met quite a few of Emerald City's socialites.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she were to accompany Jason now, many would recognize her and know that she had been to prison as well as her past. There would be a lot of criticism when they saw him with her.</p></div>
