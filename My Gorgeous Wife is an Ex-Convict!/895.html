        <h1>Chapter 894</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">[I'm alright. Hadwin took me to his mansion for a night's rest.] Lina was embarrassed to say that she had &lsquo;slept&rsquo; with Hadwin again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During breakfast, Hadwin had said in all seriousness, "You've done it to me again. You're dead meat if you don't take responsibility."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was speechless. 'Don't women suffer more? I should be the one to say these.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you take responsibility?" he asked as he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh... Sure." She nodded her head under his intense gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina felt speechless yet sweet as she thought about what happened this morning. 'It feels pretty good that Hadwin is forcing me to take responsibility!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After chatting with Grace for a short while, Lina put away her phone, turned on the computer at her desk, and got ready to work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Grace had put away her phone and was lost in thought as she looked at the case files spread out on her desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why did Jason pick me up at the bar? What the hell is going on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How did he know where I was?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is he still in my life when I&rsquo;ve turned down his offer to become his Sis again that day?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'We broke up, but the aftermath is different from what I imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I thought we would have a clean breakup, but he has repeatedly appeared in front of me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop thinking about it!' Grace said to herself. 'What I should think about is work, not Jason!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the afternoon, Lawyer Carter asked Grace to sort out the information about the accident, especially the questionable points.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go see the witness Chase Harper and verify the questionable points he said the other day. Then get him to sign to show that he willingly expressed them. I've talked to the police, but it would be hard to re-open the case for investigation. However, they're going to look at it again, so that's good news," said Lawyer Carter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's indeed good news!' thought Grace, hoping that the police could find new strong evidence and re-open the case for investigation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then sorted out the information and set out for Chase Harper's dealership.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The dealership was actually small and remote, so Grace had to take two buses to get there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she arrived at the car dealership, she only saw Chase Harper talking with a staff member. He was pointing at the parts of a car beside him from time to time, using some jargon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper had a serious expression on his face right now, which was completely different from the shy and honest person he usually was. He indeed looked like a director.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even ordinary people could impress others when they were doing something they were good at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper only noticed Grace after he was done talking to the staff. He immediately scratched his neck shyly and said, "I... I was so focused on my work that I didn't notice you. I'm sorry. I... I'll make you some tea!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "No thanks. I'm not thirsty. Besides, I&rsquo;m the one disturbing you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, no!" Chase Harper welcomed Grace into his office and poured her a cup of tea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked around the small office. Although it was small and had a lot of things, she could see that Chase Harper probably spent a lot of time here. There was also a folding bed in the room.</p></div>
