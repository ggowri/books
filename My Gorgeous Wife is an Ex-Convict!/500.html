        <h1>Chapter 499</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina wanted to hurl more insults at them when suddenly her vision was attracted to something further behind Hattie Robson at the entrance of the office. She saw her boss walking into the office, but that was not the problem. The problem was the person next to him... was Hadwin?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina blinked her eyes and looked carefully. Okay, her eyes were not playing tricks on her. It was really Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin saw her as well but did not greet her. He merely shot her a smile and continued his conversation with her boss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From Lina&rsquo;s point of view, her boss was being very respectful and humble toward Hadwin when they conversed. They were talking as they walked, and her boss got his secretary to brew some tea to serve in his office room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina thought about it and understood why. After all, their design firm was not famous in Emerald City. Their main company was slightly better in which it managed to squeeze itself into the rankings. As for their firm, it was merely a stepping stone to get into a better company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was the current boss of Stephenson Group, thus it was understandable for her boss to be extra respectful. After all, if they could get a collaboration with Stephenson Group, the company would hit the jackpot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;But why... What is Hadwin&rsquo;s purpose for coming here?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Our small design firm can&rsquo;t possibly be under his consideration?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Hadwin followed her boss into his office room. Hattie Robson looked disdainfully at Lina. &ldquo;What are you looking at? Do you know who that is? That&rsquo;s the chairman of Stephenson Group. A person like you doesn&rsquo;t have the qualifications to even stand next to him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked at Hattie Robson in disbelief. She did not expect Hattie Robson to know who Hadwin was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hattie Robson was secretly devising a plan. Their boss and her father had a good relationship, and that was why she led a good life in the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Earlier before their boss went out, he happened to see Hattie Robson and reminded her to be at her best as the chairman of Stephenson Group was visiting. He did not know the purpose of the visit but was going to find an opportunity to introduce her to him and give her a chance to show her talent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such opportunities were hard to come by. As such, when she heard about it, she immediately went online to search for more information regarding the chairman of Stephenson Group. She did not expect that the actual person looked much younger than the photos she found on the net.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After looking at Hadwin who had come in earlier and now looking at Taylor Carline, she suddenly found her boyfriend less appealing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After some time, the secretary came to inform everyone to gather at the main meeting room as there was an important announcement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In just a few short minutes, 40 to 50 people were gathered inside the meeting room. Due to the limited seats available inside the room, those lower-ranking staff had to carry their chairs into the room and sit nearer to the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was one of those who needed to bring her own seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina found a corner to sit down, and the others periodically filled in as well. What was surprising was that even the cleaning lady was told to attend the meeting as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;What&rsquo;s so important that every single worker is called in?&rsquo; Lina was puzzled. Once the meeting room was filled, her boss and Hadwin entered the meeting room. Usually, the boss would be the only person sitting at the main seat, but today, Hadwin was also seated at the front.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone could see how important Hadwin was.</p></div>
