        <h1>Chapter 2881</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Son, what's with the three million dollars?" Rowena Santiago asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne's lips trembled, but he said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian said, "Someone paid you three million dollars to make a scene like that at the comic fiesta. Why don't you tell me who that person is so I can find out who&rsquo;s plotting against Valda?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Wynne dared not say it. He would only face a dead end if he did. If he kept his mouth shut, perhaps the person who paid him three million dollars would consider saving him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne made up his mind when he thought of it. "Mr. Hart, it's my fault. I'm too greedy, but we're also Valda's relatives, after all. Please forgive our family. I can apologize to Valda. She... She&rsquo;ll forgive me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Forgive?' Ruthlessness flickered in Brian's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda broke up with him because he chose to stay with Grace when there was trouble. He was the main reason behind their breakup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so... If Wynne had not caused such a scene that day, he and Valda would still be doing well. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes became even colder as he thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said coldly, "Wynne, you&rsquo;ll never get a chance to be forgiven! If you refuse to say who it is, I'll make that person appear!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does that mean?' Wynne looked confused, but the ward door was soon pushed open. When a figure walked into the ward, Wynne's expression instantly changed. His eyes were full of shock and fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing Wynne, Phoebe Cross's expression instantly changed before returning to normal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, why did you ask someone to bring me here?" Phoebe Cross looked confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't know?" Brian asked as he raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't," replied Phoebe Cross. However, her hands that were by her sides were covered in a cold sweat, which revealed her nervousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You paid Wynne three million dollars. For what other reason would you think I got someone to bring you here?&rdquo; Brian went straight to the point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne was stunned when he heard this. It turned out... he knew everything!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he had just tried to conceal was ridiculous in retrospect.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross was silent for a long time before saying to Brian, "Let the others leave first. I want to talk to you alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian ordered his men indifferently. Soon, the people he brought left with the Theller family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The three members of the Theller family were now pale and scared, wondering how they would be treated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their only lifeline might be Valda Theller! However, with people watching them, they could not go to Valda Theller right now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Phoebe Cross and Brian remained in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross asked, "You know all about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "I've discovered everything I need to. Wynne caused a scene at the comic fiesta under your instructions, causing Valda to be scolded and mobbed. I've also sent people to arrest those who took the lead in making trouble. The source of their payments all leads back to your secretary."</p></div>
