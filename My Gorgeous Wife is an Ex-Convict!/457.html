        <h1>Chapter 456</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if she could see what her best friend was worried about, Grace said, "Never mind, I'll find out the truth and give Jennifer Atkinson justice while clearing my name!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Never mind me. What about you? How are you with Hadwin?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else? That's all." Lina shrugged and said, "We look just like a couple in a normal relationship."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was precisely because it looked too &lsquo;normal&rsquo; sometimes that she often got into a trance, thinking that she was really dating Hadwin. She even got caught up in this &lsquo;dating&rsquo; feeling. She needed to remind herself constantly that everything was fake. Hadwin was only going to take revenge after she fell in love with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I still don't think Hadwin is going to take revenge on you as you think," said Grace. If he wanted to take revenge on Lina, people like Hadwin had a lot of ways to torment people. There was no need for him to choose such a circuitous and time-consuming method.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope it's not what I think it is too." Lina curled her lips disapprovingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that Lina still thought Hadwin was dating her for revenge, but as she did not know much about Hadwin, she did not go on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some things could only be understood by experiencing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just did not want Lina to get hurt in any way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They left the washroom and headed for the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they opened the door to the private room, they saw Hadwin with one hand on the table and the other on the back of the chair Jason was sitting on. He was half bent over and talking to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their gazes were almost at eye level and their faces were very close together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Lina were stunned. Lina even gasped in exaggeration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... are you doing?" Lina only felt that the scene before her was beautiful like a picture. In her eyes, the spaces around and between the two men were filled with roses, just like in the comics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin's face darkened. Just from Lina's expression, he could guess what kind of mess was going on in her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing." Hadwin straightened up and slouched back into his seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing indeed." Jason smiled too. "Mr. Stephenson and I were just chatting."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chatting... Did they need to get so close to each other to chat? The two women doubted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right, now that we've finished our lunch, let's head back to Emerald City. If we go back now, we'll reach Emerald City by four or five o 'clock," said Jason as he stood up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When it was time to settle the bill, Jason was one step ahead and paid it with his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll treat all of you next time. Let's get together again when we're free," said Hadwin, his tone seemingly meaningful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," Jason replied calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The four walked out of the restaurant, and Jason drove them back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason usually drove luxury cars when he was driving. It was his first time driving an inexpensive car like Lina's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was filled with emotion as she watched Jason drive her rattletrap. Who would have thought her car would one day be driven by Jason?</p></div>
