        <h1>Chapter 939</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter whether I like it," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why not? If you don't like it, we can get another one," he spoke gently as if she was a princess he cherished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's as if I matter a lot to him!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace fell into a trance. He was always giving her the misconception that they never broke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you willing to stop if I don't like this brother and sister game?" The words escaped her mouth suddenly. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes darkened little by little. However, a faint smile appeared at the corner of his lips. "Don't even think about it! Never!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted her to stay with him forever and to be his sister!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could give her anything. He could get her anything she wanted, except&hellip; letting her go and&hellip;. loving her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Jason said it was just an ordinary banquet, it was a grand banquet to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many of Emerald City's socialites and public figures were there. Some of them were people Grace used to see only from the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace walked into the banquet holding Jason's arm, she naturally attracted a lot of attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could feel all eyes on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people who had met Grace before knew about their relationship while those who did not know her were now speculating about Grace's relationship with Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you hungry? Do you want to eat something first?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought about it and nodded. She was indeed a little hungry. After all, she had been taken away to get dressed and styled after work. She should have had dinner long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her stomach was now growling too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wait here, I'll get you something to eat," said Jason. If anyone heard this, they would probably be surprised again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Who in Emerald City is qualified enough for Jason to get food for them himself?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Jason&rsquo;s ex-fianc&eacute;e, Jennifer, never enjoyed such treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Jason left, Grace stood where she was and looked around. The people attending the banquet today were either socialites or popular celebrities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there were no reporters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Reporters were not allowed into certain banquets, so it was a good thing for her. At least she would not be exposed to the public where she would attract a lot of unwanted attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, being here now was no different from that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she was now in a corner, she could feel many different gazes on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a figure suddenly rushed toward Grace. They seemed to be limping slightly as they approached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. The person in front of her was an old acquaintance&mdash;Sean's sister, Zoe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was a bit surprised to see Zoe here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of which, she had not seen Zoe since she tripped her on the escalator, causing her to roll off it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you at a place like this?" asked Zoe as she stared at Grace with hatred. She had not seen Grace and Jason coming in together earlier. Therefore, when she saw Grace alone, she thought Grace had followed someone else here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This isn&rsquo;t a place for people like you." The sight of Grace filled Zoe's heart with hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If it weren't for Grace, I wouldn't be crippled!'</p></div>
