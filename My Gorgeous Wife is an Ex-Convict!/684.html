        <h1>Chapter 683</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why&rsquo;d you want to come here?" Jason asked with subtle hoarseness in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When I was a child, I used to play on this hill. Even though we weren&rsquo;t allowed to play here because the adults said it was dangerous, I&rsquo;d still sneak up the hill. I felt like an explorer on the hill," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Stella Lindsay was not a big fan of coming here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All children do that," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Back then, I always thought I&rsquo;d find some secret on this hill. For example, treasures, alien spacecraft, or maybe I&rsquo;d discover some time passage. Wasn't I silly?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps in the eyes of an adult, this hillside was not that big even if it was connected to the mountain behind it. However, in the eyes of children, it was like a new world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's adorable. However, you've grown up now. This is just a hill, after all. Come on, it's getting late. I'm worried it'll be quite late when we get back to Emerald City," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded, but she looked back at the hill again before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not notice that as she looked back at the hill, Jason's hands, which had fallen to his sides, tightened sharply. A strange look had flashed across his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily was mobbed by a group of reporters when she left the set.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Atkinson, what do you think about the court's acquittal of Mr. Sean's ex-girlfriend, Miss Cummins, today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily suddenly stopped in her tracks and looked at the reporter in front of her in disbelief. "What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reporter repeated it in a great hurry. The rest of the world did not know about the news yet. He only knew this because he had friends in court.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Grace retrial was so low-key that the public was not aware of it. Therefore, this was exclusive news for him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reporter became excited as he thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily's face paled. 'Case reversal? Grace's case has been reversed?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Lily heard Dexter Rios's name from the reporter's mouth, her face turned even paler. She had not heard of that name in more than three years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, the reporter said that the court would set another date to sentence Dexter Rios for framing Grace back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Atkinson, Jennifer Atkinson's death had nothing to do with Grace. She was wronged. Will it affect your relationship with Mr. Stevens? Also, you've said many times on various occasions that you&rsquo;d never forgive Grace. Would you like to apologize to Grace now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reporter continued to fire questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a frown, Lily ignored the reporter and walked quickly toward her car. The reporter tried to catch up but was stopped by Lily's assistant and bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily returned to her and Sean&rsquo;s home, but he had yet to return.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lily immediately called her father and asked him to check whether this news was true. After all, she had searched the internet for a long time and could not find any news about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">An hour later, Harold called his daughter. "The case was really reversed. Dexter Rios was arrested and sent back to the country half a month ago."</p></div>
