        <h1>Chapter 1042</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the senior executives kept guessing as they waited on pins and needles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After about ten minutes, Jason finally put down his phone and coldly spat out the words, "Go on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The senior executives went on with their meeting in fear. They were cautious with their words and spoke softly, fearing that they might accidentally offend the president.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence looked at his boss' gloomy face and groaned in his heart. He saw what Master Reed just saw, but he was more afraid because of that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why did those two bodyguards send Master Reed photos of Brian and Grace together? Don't they know it'll upset Master Reed?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They should send some decent photos if they wanted to!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was no need to send him photos of Brian and Grace so close together, especially the photo where Grace was holding one of Brian's arms and putting an adhesive bandage on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, the photos were taken aesthetically, especially the shot of Grace and Brian looking into each other's eyes. It looked just like a screenshot of a scene from a TV show!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence seriously thought he should assign bodyguards with poor photography skills for Grace in the future. Now, he could only pray that Master Reed would not get upset.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, Emerald City would probably be sent shaking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, it's just as you suspected. Someone was behind the three thugs!" Lina called Grace and told her what Hadwin Stephenson found out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. 'I knew it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Guess who ordered those three men," Lina said with a quip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's either the Weiss family or the Daniels family, but personally, I think it's more likely the Daniels family," said Grace. In her opinion, even if Martin Weiss had a grudge against Kyla Corbyn, he would not use such petty means on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If a man like Martin Weiss wanted to lay a hand on Kyla Corbyn, he would be much more clever and ruthless! Instead, Paisley Daniels was the most likely to do such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How... How did you guess it?" Lina asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought for a moment and said, "I think Paisley Daniels's pettier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had looked through Kyla's case files and learned that Kyla was imprisoned because she pushed Paisley Daniels down the stairs, causing the woman to suffer from a miscarriage. Kyla was sent to prison for intentional injury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the alleged &lsquo;assault&rsquo;, the two supposedly got into an argument on the stairs when Kyla pushed Paisley Daniels down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the stairway was not very high. According to the injury report submitted by the hospital, Paisley Daniels did not suffer many injuries. She only had a few scratches and bruises on her body. However, she suffered serious consequences such as a miscarriage and permanent infertility!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Paisley Daniels's attending doctor at the time quit his job after Kyla's case. No one knew about his current whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Grace's opinion, Paisley Daniels was not clever. However, Martin Weiss still believed Paisley Daniels's words and testified against Kyla in court!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did Paisley Daniels do this because of Nelson's custody case?' Grace thought to herself. Instead of going straight home after her phone call with Lina, she went to the place where Kyla Corbyn set up her food stall at night.</p></div>
