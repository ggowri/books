        <h1>Chapter 1170</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shuddered at the thought of her car accident with Jennifer. She still remembered that feeling of fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this car accident... did not give her fear, but... a heavy bitterness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just saved the person I love. Why are you thanking me?" Brian said with a faint smile that had a rare touch of gentleness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella jealously looked at the smile on his face. Brian's smile was for Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, what saving are you talking about? Didn't you get into a car accident yesterday?" Stella asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Instead of answering, Brian said, "Stella, I want to drink some soy milk. Why don't you go downstairs and buy me some?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella could sense Brian deliberately pushing her away, but at the moment, she could not give a reason not to buy him the soy milk, so she could only say, "Okay, I'll go buy it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, on her way out of the ward, she glanced at the two who remained in the room out of the corners of her eyes. The jealousy in her eyes grew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace's such a nuisance. It's just like what Evelyn said. I&rsquo;ll never exist in Brian's eyes as long as Grace is around!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only when Brian hated and repelled Grace and even became so disappointed in Grace would Stella have the opportunity to truly be with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With this in mind, Stella secretly made up her mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the ward, Grace looked at Brian and asked with concern, "How do you feel? Do your wounds hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile on his lips widened. "You're finally worrying and caring about me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You saved me. Of course, I care about you!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I hadn&rsquo;t saved you?" he retorted. However, before she could answer, he said with self-mockery, "I asked a silly question. But Grace, I'm happy that I could save you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark phoenix eyes were so serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was badly injured and could have lost his life, but he was happy about it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's nose was a little sore. She always heard people saying that the crown prince of the entertainment industry had many girlfriends, but he was too cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was cold to a certain extent that he was heartless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had also thought he was a heartless man when she first knew him, but the things he had done made her indebted to him time and again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way... Why did you drive out at that time yesterday?" asked Grace, changing the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I drove to your rental house to see you but saw you in your friend's car. You didn't stop, and the route you took was a bit weird, so I followed you. The next thing I know, your car was going to hit that sand truck, so I drove over," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, he had just driven over and hit their car without even thinking about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you think about the danger? If you had accidentally hit the sand truck due to inertia and the truckload of sand fell on you, it'd be like being buried alive!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." Brian looked Grace straight in the eyes and said, "I didn't have time to think about anything. But even if I was given time to think about it now, I would still make the same choice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned, and for a moment, she did not know what to say.</p></div>
