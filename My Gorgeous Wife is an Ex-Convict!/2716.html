        <h1>Chapter 2714</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss and Shana Nicholls entered the mansion. They stopped in their steps after seeing Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned and seemed to ask crossly, "Why are you still up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla forced a smile. "I'm waiting for you to come back. There's still time before today ends. It's 11 o&rsquo;clock. We have another hour before midnight."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes darkened before he turned to Shana Nicholls beside him. He said, "Go back to your room first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shana Nicholls tactfully answered in acknowledgment and returned to her room. Kyla was returning to Emerald City tomorrow anyway. She no longer saw Kyla as a threat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss tugged at his tie, went up, and said, "You have only one hour left. What more do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll make you a bowl of noodles. I got the servant to prepare the ingredients today. I was going to have noodles for dinner. Since you've returned, consider it late-night supper. Wait here in the dining room. It won't take long," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she hurried into the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pressed his lips together and finally sat in the dining room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla walked out with two bowls of noodles, he looked at the bowl of noodles with a flash of doubt in his eyes. "Longevity noodles?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. It's not your birthday, but... I want you to live a long life, so I cooked it," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A long life?" He sneered. "Do you think I'll live a long life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing is impossible in this world. Just like how I thought I might not have much longer to live, but I&rsquo;m still alive," she said. He was the one who gave her this life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at the time. There were still 40 minutes left before midnight. "I hope you'll keep your word and sign the divorce papers 40 minutes later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She replied gently, "Yeah. Dig in. The time will be up when we finish the noodles."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss lowered his head and ate the bowl of hot noodles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla watched him eat the noodles in a daze. When her eyes started welling up with tears, she quickly lowered her head to eat her noodles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't cry! I don't want him to see me crying in my last moments with him.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she ate the noodles, she could not help asking, "Martin Weiss, are you... sure you won't love me anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gently looked up at her. "Do you think I can fall for you again? Kyla, I thought that my unwillingness to lift my hypnosis should be enough to make you realize how much I don't want to love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face paled a little before she laughed at herself. "I know. It's just that... I want to give up on the idea forever, so... that I can make myself stop pestering you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she lowered her head and continued eating the noodles. She looked as if all was well. However, her trembling hand that held the chopsticks gave away her emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They finished the noodles at last. They had five minutes left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took out the divorce papers and a pen. Soon... she would no longer be his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, she looked at him and said, "Lastly, I want you to promise me one thing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned. "What are you trying to pull now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just want you to promise me you'll never lift the hypnosis on yourself!" she said.</p></div>
