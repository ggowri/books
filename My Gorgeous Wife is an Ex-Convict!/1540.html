        <h1>Chapter 1538</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is this what it feels like to be held by your sister? The sister in front of me seems to be different from my other sister, Oriel. Every time she sees me, she just timidly stands there while looking at me with desperate eyes, wanting to please me. But she never once dared approach me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But this sister... She holds my hand and hugs me like Mommy...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed was unwilling to push his mother's arms away earlier. Now, he was also unwilling to push his sister&rsquo;s arms away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was happy to see the two children bonding. Although her son was rather indifferent, her daughter was more talkative and would take the initiative to approach people. Her son did not seem to reject her daughter, which was a good thing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Soon, Dr. Guzman came. After seeing Grace and Jasper Reed, surprise seemed to flash across Dr. Guzman's eyes. However, he quickly crouched down and focused on examining Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mr. Reed slowly opened his eyes. "I'm much better now. It doesn't hurt as much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Dr. Guzman was surprised. After all, every time Young master Reed had a headache, it would last for quite some time. From the time he got the call from Uncle Kwan to the moment he arrived, it had only been 20 minutes at most. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Young master Reed's headache... is alright now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'd better examine you again," Dr. Guzman said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pondered for a moment before following Dr. Guzman to the room on the second floor for an examination. Grace looked at Uncle Kwan who returned to the living room and asked, "Does Jay often have headaches?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"In... the first year you weren't around, he suffered a lot of headaches but they&rsquo;ve lessened in the last two years. Maybe he's having a headache now because he met you today, Young Madam," speculated Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was silent. 'Is his headache related to his memories being erased? Is my appearance triggering those buried memories?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Was that why he had looked at her like he was in a trance earlier and called her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; in an almost unconscious state?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you my little sister?" Her son's childlike voice pulled Grace out of her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why can't I be your older sister?" Jasper said in confusion as she blinked her bright almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked on as the two little ones discussed who was older and who was younger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Finally, the two pairs of eyes looked at her. Jasper asked, "Mommy, who's older?" Mick Reed did not say anything, but his expression showed that he wanted answers too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"..." Grace was speechless. This question was really... complicated! She had no idea who was older and who was younger, so Grace looked at Uncle Kwan who was nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Uncle Kwan quickly said, "Secretary Wang only brought Little Young Master back. He never told us the children's birth order."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In other words, they could only find out the answer when they found Secretary Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at the two children in front of her and asked tentatively, "Why don't you play rock paper scissors to decide who's older and who's younger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm your older brother," Mick Reed's childlike voice said with certainty. His little face was solemn, but he was determined not to play rock paper scissors.</p></div>
