        <h1>Chapter 2557</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When I donated blood the last time, I heard from the nurses that his disease requires him to undergo transfusion treatment with his immediate family's blood. That&rsquo;s his only shot at survival, right? His blood type is the same as mine, so he'll recover if I can donate enough blood for his transfusion. Isn&rsquo;t that right?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory came back to his senses. "Yes, we do need you to help Simon with his transfusion so that he'll recover, but&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll help Simon with his transfusion. Even if he isn't my child, I'll do it if my blood can save someone else," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After going through so many things, she realized the value of life and was more willing to help those in need.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she looked intently again at Simon who was still unconscious. Then, she turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory grabbed Amber Mitchell's arm. "Do you think I said that to make you help Simon with his transfusion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else? Do you really want us to acknowledge each other? George Gregory, you can stop the act. Given the choice, I think you would rather Louise Mitchell be her mother than me," Amber Mitchell said mockingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said, "I'm not acting, and I don't have to act in front of you! I... I really want to ask for your forgiveness."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice began to grow hoarse, while his dark eyes seemed to be tearing up. There was even a touch of inferiority in his proud expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amby, give me another chance, okay? Let's start over. I won't misunderstand and doubt you this time. I&rsquo;ll be good to you. You&rsquo;ll have a bright future ahead of you," George Gregory choked out the words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell could not help laughing. "A bright future? George Gregory, what future is there for you and me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll make up for what you've suffered. I'll make you happy!" he said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Amber Mitchell only said, "You can never make up for what I've suffered. George Gregory, I'm Herman's wife now. Don't ever say such absurd things to me again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Absurd?" He stared at her. "Who's being absurd now? Herman Moss's already dead. You have no legal support by marrying a dead man!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why should I need legal support to marry? I'm marrying him because I love him!" Amber Mitchell raised her chin and said sternly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You love him? You love Herman Moss?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I love Herman, even if he's dead. Death doesn't mean the end of love." Instead, her love for Herman only began after his death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If only... she had fallen in love with Herman earlier. Maybe many things would not have ended like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Amber Mitchell lifted her hand to break away from George Gregory's grip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stubbornly refused to let go, feeling that he might not be able to hold her ever again if he did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory, it's no use holding on like this. You know what? You only disgust me every time you touch me. I hope I never have to see you again!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her words seemed to trigger him. He suddenly pulled her into his arms before lowering his head and kissing her hard on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The intense kiss seemed to want to prove something or bring her back in time.</p></div>
