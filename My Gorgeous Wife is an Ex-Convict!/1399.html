        <h1>Chapter 1398</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He still remembered the time he had returned to the hospital for his follow-up. Paisley had come up to him with a smile and said, "I accidentally learned that you're the person I saved. It's great to hear that you're recovering well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, he found out what kind of person had donated their bone marrow to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The first time they found a suitable donor in the bone marrow bank, the person had refused to donate when the doctor called to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He only felt that the whole world had turned dark. He had so much unfinished business that he did not want to die yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, the bone marrow bank found another donor who matched with him. While waiting for the answer, he had been fraught with the dread of being rejected again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He realized that staying alive was a luxury. He needed others' pity and bestowal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid of being rejected again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was terrified!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the hospital brought him good news afterward. That person had promised to donate without any demands and said they would cooperate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart had been full of gratitude and he even thought of thanking them in person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it had been an anonymous donation and the person had no intention to reveal themselves. They only asked the doctor to pass him a message. "Live a good life. Maybe we'll meet amid the crowd someday!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, when Paisley appeared in front of him, he saw the woman who had dragged him back from the brink of death. He vowed to use all his power to protect this kind woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could give Paisley the best of everything. If Paisley loved him, he could also give Paisley a title, honor, wealth, and the life she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Kyla Corbyn, he had only gotten together with Kyla Corbyn for revenge. What he had for Kyla Corbyn were false affections. There was no love!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, no love!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could he have possibly fallen in love with someone with the last name Carbyn?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss walked up to Kyla Corbyn and stared at her from a commanding position. His gaze was extremely cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should never have slandered Paisley. Do you expect me to believe you? No, I'll always believe in Paisley only! Just grovel to Paisley and apologize."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, one of the two men subduing Kyla Corbyn had his hand on Kyla Corbyn's head. He forcefully pushed her head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Kyla Corbyn tried her best to resist, the bodyguard only pushed her head more and more to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that perhaps she could not escape the humiliation today no matter what. Her resistance now would only make it more painful for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes stared at the man in front of her, and her hoarse voice almost squeezed the words through her teeth. "Martin Weiss, I never knew I could hate a person so much. I&rsquo;ll hate you for the rest of my life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was done speaking, her forehead was pressed to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a thump, it hurt her forehead and also shattered her dignity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had thought she could be indifferent to him until the end of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had hoped that all their grudges would dissipate with her death. All she asked was for him to be nicer to their son and that Nelson could be happier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... she now realized she could not do it.</p></div>
