        <h1>Chapter 2136</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the baby appeared, the little boy looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I beg you to save my wife!" said Hadwin Stephenson. His clothes were wrinkly while his chin was covered with stubble. He had not washed his hair for days either. He looked extremely dejected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His voice was hoarse after not speaking for days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why should I save her? She's nobody to me," the little boy said indifferently. His indifference seemed to exude from his core. It did not match his age at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But she's my everything. You showed up and helped my wife deliver our baby that day. Save her again. I'll do anything as long as you&rsquo;re willing to save her!" Hadwin Stephenson begged. The boy was his last hope!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I wasn't trying to save her that day. I was saving the baby," the little boy mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sure enough! The others instantly understood when they heard the boy say this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla suddenly said to the little boy, "Save the baby's mother, then. How sad will the baby be if she has no mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is not having a mother something to be sad over?" The little boy looked puzzled as if the idea of family bonds was unfamiliar to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, she'll be very sad! You've met the baby's mother, haven't you? You&rsquo;ve talked to her before. She's a good woman. The baby will be so happy to have her raise her!" said Kyla. At this point, they could only play the baby card.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hopefully, this little boy cared enough about the baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Hadwin Stephenson suddenly knelt to the little boy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His action surprised everyone. Even the little boy looked at him in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I beg you to save my wife!" Hadwin Stephenson sobbed as he begged. He must not let go of his last hope!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the baby in the man's arms woke up and began to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The baby's crying seemed to make the little boy's expression change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stared at the crying baby. After quite some time, he finally stepped forward to take the baby from Hadwin Stephenson's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson froze but did not stop the boy. He carefully handed him his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was something indescribably sweet about the seven-year-old boy holding the tiny baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The baby girl continued to cry, and the little boy frowned. "Why does she keep crying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's because she's hungry and needs milk," said Grace, while Jason asked someone to fetch the baby's milk from the nurse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Moments later, a 30-milliliter milk bottle was brought over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy picked up the bottle and began feeding the baby milk. He was awfully unskilled as he fed the baby milk. Grace and Kyla guided him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the baby went back to sleep after finishing the milk, the little boy asked, "What's her name?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">" Tina Stephenson," said Hadwin Stephenson. Lina and he had decided on the name before their baby was born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">" Tina..." the little boy muttered as he stared at the baby's sleeping face. "I can save her mother, but Tina's mine after I save her."</p></div>
