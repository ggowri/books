        <h1>Chapter 1611</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was still early after she got out of the detention center. It was two hours before the two children were done with their classes in kindergarten, so Grace went to Kyla's place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace was about to reach Kyla's store, she saw the same black car again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car was still parked in the corner where the shadows were just like last time. From where the car was parked, the people inside would be able to get a good view of Kyla's store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace knew it was Martin Weiss's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss had not dated anyone all these years and even moved half of Weiss Group to Emerald City. Grace knew he probably did all these for Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Broken mirrors could be reassembled, but spilled water could not be retrieved. If Martin Weiss had not aggressively forced Kyla back then, maybe he could have been with Kyla a long time ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace came to the store. Kyla was making handmade bracelets. Grace remembered doing it when she was little. You could take different colored yarns and make something like bracelets in different ways. It was quite popular among little girls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kyla, why are you making this?" Grace asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's popular among the girls in primary school recently. I'm free anyway, so I might as well make these to earn some extra money." Kyla smiled and looked at Grace. "What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I happened to be free, so I came to see you." Grace hesitated a little before speaking, "I saw Martin Weiss's car just now. Does he come often?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really? I don't pay much attention to that," said Kyla. Her indifferent expression made it seem as though Martin Weiss had nothing to do with her no matter what people said about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace sighed. "Kyla, if you don't want to forgive Martin Weiss, have you ever thought of finding another person to love? After all, you're still young. Are you really going to spend your life like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla smiled faintly. "I've forgiven Martin Weiss. Grace, I forgave Martin Weiss when he donated me his liver. But forgiveness doesn't equal falling in love with him again. I have no feelings for him. Similarly, I don't want to find love anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No buts. I'm happy just staying alive and spending my days with Nelson by my side. That's all that matters to me." Kyla smiled and said, "If I can live until Nelson gets married and has children, then I'll help him take care of his children and spend my remaining years in peace. Won't that be good?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace knew that everyone had their own opinions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Especially after almost experiencing death, Kyla was probably indifferent to romance now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, Grace also smiled and did not bring up the subject again. Instead, she started talking excitedly about bracelet weaving with Kyla, thinking of weaving some for her two kids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As they chatted, Grace suddenly saw a small figure squatting at the school gate not far from the store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As the school gates were closed and there was no one there, the small figure stood out all the more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace murmured, "That kid... Why is he all alone at the school gate? Where&rsquo;s his family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla glanced at the school gate and said, "That kid is Mason. He was adopted by a family in the neighborhood. His sister started primary school this year and he would often squat at the school gate, waiting for his sister to finish school."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Mason?' Grace was surprised. It was the same child she had seen in the amusement park that day.</p></div>
