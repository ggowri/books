        <h1>Chapter 150</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't worry, it's fine," Grace answered. "Because actually... everyone at the Sanitation Service Center already knows about the accident that caused Jennifer Atkinson's death and my three years in prison."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The man reclining on the sofa held his cheek with one hand and a glass of red wine in the other, sipping from it occasionally. The man looked beautiful and innocent, and there was a hint of allure that unwittingly emanated from between his brows. It was if a slight glance from him could make anyone fall deep into the tightly woven net within his eyes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Unable to escape or leave, I willingly falling into his trap.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"And it's no wonder that so many ladies of note in Emerald City have feelings for him!" Patrick studied Jason as he drank alone and could not help sighing internally. "But they're all feelings and few people have turned those feelings into actions.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"After all, those who have taken 'action' have irritated Mr. Reed and ended up miserable, even becoming a joke in Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why are you here drinking alone? If you're here to meet your friends, you should at least bring that woman. I really want to meet her. What kind of woman could make you abandon your Old Master on Thanksgiving?" Patrick asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm so curious about this woman. Although Jason said that it was just a game on the phone that day and that there was no good reason to meet her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But... I've never seen Jason play any games with other women!" Therefore, Patrick was dubious of Jason's statement.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gripping the wine glass, Jason's fingers faltered a little. He raised his breathtakingly beautiful and amorous eyes and stared at Patrick with a faint smile on his face. "Oh, do you really want to meet her?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Patrick's hairs stood on end immediately and a sense of crisis arose within him. "It feels like if I nod now, I'll come to no good end.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's as if what I said just now broke his taboo.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"A woman is Jason's... taboo? Does that mean that the woman is actually important to Jason, or am I overthinking things?!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Patrick figured that he was overthinking and immediately flashed Jason an embarrassed smile. "I don't want to meet her. Happy?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As they were talking, two figures suddenly walked in through the entrance. Patrick hurriedly changed the topic of conversation. "It's Brian, that kid. He's bringing that new girlfriend again today. Why does this kid keep looking for starlets as his girlfriends for the past two years? He makes one famous, then finds another to make her famous. How many starlets does he wish to make famous?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Patrick was made speechless by the speed at which Brian changed girlfriends. And yet, Brian doted on every one of his girlfriends while he was with them, giving them anything they wanted. However, once they broke up, he was frustratingly frank and ruthless.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Some even said that Brian was heartless. Even if he excessively doted on a woman, he would cast her aside like an old shoe in the blink of an eye once he tired of her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, Evelyn took Brian's arm and entered the magnificent banquet hall with him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'd never even dared to think of visiting such places before. Now I'm so nurtured in the film crew and Brian also said that I could be the female lead in my next television series.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"To me, this is like winning the lottery. Previously, just to ensure that my characters could have a little more dialogue, I had to continuously curry favor with all the screenwriters, assistant directors, directors, and so on. Even if I drank with them and laughed at their jokes, it would sometimes not even be possible.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Now all it takes is for Brian to say the word and I can be the female lead.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But my biggest prize is being Brian's girlfriend!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The only thing I regret is that although Brian dotes on me in ways which could be considered meticulous, buying me the branded bags and luxury clothes I could only look at in the past and so on, whenever I want to be intimate with him, he only calmly says, 'There's no need for that.'"</p></div>
