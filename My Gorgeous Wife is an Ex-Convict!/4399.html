        <h1>Chapter 4397: I Like You</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't go!" Lornell said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley frowned, "Let go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you planning to go see Calvert? If he really doesn't want to, there are plenty of ways to handle it. You don't need to worry at all!" Lornell said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley bit her red lips, shouldn't she be worried? But now her heart was pounding hard. She had this feeling that if she didn't go, she might regret it for the rest of her life.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go!" Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley!" Lornell gazed at her passionately, "Lornell has his agent by his side. If he doesn't want to deal with something, his agent will handle it for him. But have you thought about what would happen if you really went over there? How many rumors would start flying around? You might even end up trending online, with countless scandalous stories about you and him. He can use these scandals to his advantage, but what about you? What do you get out of it? Or are you saying you don't care about the scandals, and you're planning to be with him?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was silent, only hearing his own heart pounding "Thump! Thump! Thump!" incessantly.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, don't go!" Lornell said, gripping Harley's hand a bit tighter.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need to gain anything," Harley said, gently pulling his hand away from Lornell's. "I just want to follow my heart."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, all she wants is to confirm Calvert's safety, to know how he's really doing!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What if I don't want you to go?" Lornell suddenly said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Harley was taken aback.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell gave a bitter smile, "Harley, don't go, okay? Can you please avoid any more scandals with Calvert? If you just see him as a regular friend, then treat him like one. I... I don't want you to go!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This doesn't seem to have anything to do with you, I don't understand, what does it matter to you whether he's just a friend to me or not?" Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because I like you!" Lornell said, "I want to start over with you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she was first rumored to be involved with Calvert, he experienced jealousy for the first time. It felt as if something precious had been stolen from him, leaving him utterly helpless.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, he just didn't understand what that feeling was.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He only knew that he would always think of Harley, and every time he did, it felt like his heart was being pricked by a needle.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, to escape, he even went straight abroad.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But these two years abroad made him gradually realize that he </span><span>actually liked</span><span> her, liked her very much... From the moment he saved her when they were kids, he fell for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The so-called "curiosity" often stems from fondness.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Chandler, out of curiosity, has a fianc&eacute;e, he too wants to have a fianc&eacute;e. He wants to understand what it feels like to have a fianc&eacute;e.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But why would he be curious?!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because he loves the smile on her face, he wants that smile to belong to him alone!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He learned from Chandler that being engaged can transform two unrelated individuals into a pair bound by a fixed relationship.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, he simply took advantage of her illness to become her fianc&eacute;, creating a bond between them.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But perhaps because he got it so easily, he never cherished it. Even after so many years, he knew clearly that she liked him, but he took it for granted, ultimately ruining their relationship himself!</span></p></div>
