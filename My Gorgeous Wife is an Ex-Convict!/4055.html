        <h1>Chapter 4053</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Pfft, why would he be jealous? Chandler is not that petty," Tina said, but she couldn't help but think of what Chandler had said to her later that day -</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No matter how many people you're interested in, the one you'll truly fall in love with can only be me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So, when she wants to chase after stars or something, he will accompany her. Even if she cheers for some male star, buys his photo album, or joins his fan club, he doesn't say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Is it because it hasn't crossed his bottom line yet?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Because he knows that she only appreciates those stars or beauties, and hasn't really fallen in love with them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What are you thinking about?" Eugenia suddenly asked her friend who was lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm thinking about whether I really love Chandler," Tina muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia's eyes widened, "Don't tell me you don't love him. You've been engaged for so many years and are going to get married as soon as you graduate!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "It's not that I don't love him, but I don't know what it means to love someone," Tina said. Her engagement to Chandler was arranged since she was born, so it was just a matter of course.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was so natural that she didn't have any rebellious thoughts to resist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even when she was teased by other children when she was young, saying that her marriage was arranged by her family, she didn't feel anything wrong with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, she really liked Chandler's company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Aren't you someone who loves people with good looks? Don't you love Chandler's appearance?" Eugenia asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You're also very beautiful, and I like you too. But does that mean I love you?" Tina asked back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Stop it!" Eugenia shuddered. She wasn't ready to go down that road yet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Besides, if Tina really "loved" her, she didn't know if Chandler would just bury her on a dark and stormy night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Actually, it's simple to know whether you really love Chandler or not. You just need to see how intimate you can get with him," Eugenia thought for a moment and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Can we be more intimate?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina lowered her head, lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For Tina, the closest level of intimacy between her and Chandler was sleeping in the same bed together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, this sleeping was just simply holding each other while sleeping.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even before she was 7 years old, Chandler used to often hold her and nap together. As she grew older, Chandler slept with her less and less, and the last time they slept together was apparently 3 years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for other forms of intimacy, like hugging and holding hands, those were common.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But kissing...it was only on the cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking about it, even though she and Chandler were engaged and only one step away from getting married, she had never had any intimate behavior with him like a typical couple would.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So how intimate could she be with Chandler?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kissing like a normal couple? Physical intimacy? Even making love?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whatever step she was willing to take, she would understand whether or not she truly loved him.</p></div>
