        <h1>Chapter 2292</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her refusal now seemed to have struck him so hard that he froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... do you mean?" At that moment, he only hoped that he had misunderstood or perhaps heard her wrong!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla calmly repeated, "Martin Weiss, I don't want to start over with you. After the baby is born, I think... we should just get a divorce. We don't have to drag it on for a year as we previously agreed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Little by little, his face turned pale, and his thin lips opened with difficulty as he muttered, "You... won't?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I won't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But you&rsquo;ve clearly been showing your feelings for me these days!" he said. The things that had happened recently, the way she had been looking at him, and what she had been doing for him all seemed to tell him that he had a place in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she gave him such an answer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What I&rsquo;ve been showing you thus far is just my gratitude to you for saving me. Martin Weiss, I lost all my love for you when I was sent to prison. A broken mirror can&rsquo;t be fixed, and what&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be undone. Don't you understand that when feelings are gone, they&rsquo;re gone for good?" she said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only she knew how much restraint she needed to maintain that calmness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Gratitude?" His emotions surged as he reached out and grabbed her. "How could you let me hold your hand to sleep and look worried every time the doctors and nurses change my dressing if you&rsquo;re only grateful to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why not? You got injured because of me. Naturally, I&rsquo;m concerned about your injury. The reason why I let you hold my hand to sleep is just so you can fall asleep easily and to give your body some rest," said Kyla as she looked at Martin Weiss with indifferent eyes. "It seems like you've misunderstood."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Misunderstood? Did I really misunderstand?" he murmured with pain, reluctance, and doubt in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The things that happened in the past few days&hellip; Was it all just his unrequited love?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now that you&rsquo;ve recovered and are going to be discharged, my 'repayment' will probably end here," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Repayment?" He suddenly sneered and whispered hoarsely, "So you're trying to tell me that all you&rsquo;ve been doing these days is just to repay me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She replied, "Yes. Will you please let go of my hand now? I want to put away my food containers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his hand was still tightly gripping her wrist as his dark eyes stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A suffocating feeling filled the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla frowned. She twisted her wrist but could not break away from his fingers at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, you..." She had just started speaking when his left hand instantly grabbed the back of her head. He kissed her heavily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he kissing me? But we shouldn't do this.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She put her hand against his chest and tried to push him away with all her might, but she hesitated at the thought of his wounds. In the end, she just stood there blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometime later, he finally ended the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you push me away? If you don&rsquo;t feel anything for me, you would&rsquo;ve pushed me away, no?" Martin Weiss's voice rang in Kyla's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When did you become so innocent?" Kyla looked at Martin Weiss, smiling derisively. "Does a kiss mean affection? Even if we sleep with each other, it doesn't mean we have feelings for each other!"</p></div>
