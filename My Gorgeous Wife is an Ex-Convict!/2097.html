        <h1>Chapter 2095</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, Grace's anxious voice sounded. "Martin Weiss, why are you the one answering the call? Where's Kyla? Why do you have Kyla's phone? What have you done to Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, I... I'm fine," Kyla said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, Martin Weiss didn't do anything to you, did he?" Grace asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He..." Kyla hesitated a little. "Probably won't do anything to me. My mom's looking after the store right now. I&rsquo;ll be back soon. If you're coming over, don't tell my mom I'm with Martin Weiss right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the second half of Kyla'ssentence made Martin Weiss's face grimmer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, you heard it," Martin Weiss said to Grace. "Grace, you'd better not interfere in my and Kyla's affairs. Otherwise, I won't go easy on you even if you're the mistress of the Reed family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Martin Weiss immediately hung up the phone and looked at Kyla. "It seems that your friend is really worried about you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla pursed her lips and said after a long pause, "Martin Weiss, what exactly do you want?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stared at her grimly without a word!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace, who was on the other end of the line, stared at the phone. Although Kyla said she was fine, Martin Weiss had her phone. It did not seem like things were fine!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Grace turned the car around and headed to the Reed group building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she arrived at Jason's company, Grace gave her car to the security guard at the entrance and rushed in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Everyone here knew the mistress of the Reed family! Therefore, they were respectful to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace ran to Jason's office. She was instantly dumbfounded as soon as she pushed the door open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Many executives were in the large office, but the atmosphere was particularly solemn and depressing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As soon as these executives saw Grace, they all looked expectant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, the boss was in a bad mood, and he was already losing his temper. The only one who could stop him was Young Madam!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Among them, Terrence's gaze was the most eager.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, he had just been wondering if he should sneak a call and get Young Madam to &lsquo;calm&rsquo; Jason down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Speaking of which, when their boss lost his temper, it was unlike a normal boss&rsquo; lecturing. When others lectured their subordinates, they usually yelled, but Young master Reed would not. He would only glance at his subordinates nonchalantly and show a half-smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the more he did that, the more frightening it was. It was like having a knife hanging over your head but never falling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">You never knew when the knife would fall and would tremble with fear as you waited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Am I... interrupting?" asked Grace, but she still hesitated to leave the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, she drove here right away as she was eager to find out Kyla's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No." Jason smiled, got up, and walked over to Grace. "What are you doing here at this hour?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This smile was unlike the sneer he showed to his subordinates. His eyes were tender.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's just that... I need your help with something," said Grace. Then, she looked at the executives in the office.</p></div>
