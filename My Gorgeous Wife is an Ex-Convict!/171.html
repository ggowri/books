        <h1>Chapter 170</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had not gotten much sleep the night before. In addition to her grandmother&rsquo;s issue, her problems were only getting worse. Right now, Grace felt as if she was floating on air.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After walking a while, Grace brushed shoulders with a passerby and stumbled onto the ground.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Fortunately, her clothes were thick enough, so she did not experience much pain.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as she was about to stand up, she felt some hurried steps running toward her. That person quickly helped her up.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace took a look and was shocked to see Chase.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why are you..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"My car is just by the roadside. Let me send you home." Grace may have rejected his offer, but he was still worried about her. Therefore, he had slowly driven his car while trailing behind her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Nevermind, I can get home on my own."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You fell so easily after merely brushing past a passerby. How am I to be at ease seeing you go home alone? My car is just by the roadside. If we continue to dawdle here, I'll get a traffic summon if the police come!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace saw how persistent he was. She sighed and followed him to his car.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chase drove toward the direction of Grace's rented place.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You don't need to burden yourself by thinking that I expect something in return for sending you home. I know that I'm not capable enough and am unable to match up with your ex-boyfriend. I'm just worried about something happening to you. I'll be more at ease if I made sure you got home safely," Chase said earnestly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Thanks." What happened in the past was only like a dream to the present Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Right now, it was she who did not match up to him. Who would dare to marry someone with a criminal record and was released after a jail term?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chase hesitated. "Two days ago, I saw you getting into a Porsche. If you&rsquo;ve found a good match, I... I'll be more than happy for you. However... I'm just worried that you're getting cheated. You should get to know the person more before..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace interrupted Chase, "That person isn't someone I'm seeing. I had coincidentally picked up something that belonged to that person, so he bought me lunch as a gesture of gratitude."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Oh, I see." A glimmer of hope rose in his face once again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Soon, the car arrived at the entrance of Grace's residential area. She looked at him and said, "Chase, you're a nice person, but I'm not suitable for you. Don't waste any more of your time on me. You'll surely meet someone better in the future!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're good enough in my opinion." Chase blushed. &ldquo;I can wait for you..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"As what you've said just now. My ex-boyfriend is a wealthy person. It&rsquo;s either I won&rsquo;t get married, or I&rsquo;ll need to find someone who can match my ex-boyfriend&rsquo;s status. That's why we are not suitable, understand?" Grace put it bluntly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">'Perhaps this is the only way to make him give up on me.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">'It is better to suffer now when the roots are not as deep yet. Chase is a good person. I would not have said so if not because he was so persistent.'</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chase looked extremely dejected and stared blankly at Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Alright, I'll get going. Thanks for today, but you don't need to send me home in the future anymore." She opened the door, got out of the car, and headed for the guardhouse.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Behind her, the sound of a car engine was heard distancing away.</p></div>
