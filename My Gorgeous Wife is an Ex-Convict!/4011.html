        <h1>Chapter 4009</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Irene, you deserve to die!" His voice was cold, almost squeezed through his teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what if I deserve to die? It's really funny, I'm still alive, but Nancy hasn't been found yet. She probably didn't have my luck and has been eaten by fish in the sea, bones and all..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Irene's voice suddenly stopped because Mick had grabbed her by the neck, causing her face to turn red and unable to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The police officer next to them quickly stepped forward to persuade Mick and tried to pry his hand off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, even though Irene was the criminal now, if she was really killed, it would cause a lot of public opinion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then the criminal would become Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Mick finally let go, Irene had collapsed on the bed, her face extremely pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even so, Irene continued to speak mercilessly, "Mick... this is... your retribution. You easily discarded me before, even when I was about to be kicked out of the Reed family, you didn't say a word for me. Now... in the end, you've been discarded by Nancy too... you'll never see her again in your life..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Irene, I won't let you die. I want you to live in pain for the rest of your life!" After saying this, Mick left the hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Irene's fate was decided then and there!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mick... Mick..." Irene let out a sharp, hoarse cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the pleasure of revenge had passed, that fearful feeling of terror returned to Irene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sadly, at that moment, she realized that she didn't even have the courage to commit suicide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick didn't know how he ended up back at the Reed family's place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His heart was filled with sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why... wasn't it Nancy who was saved? Why wasn't it Nancy who was found?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did Irene have to live?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then where is Nancy? Where is she now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or is it true, as Irene said, that she's long gone and her bones have turned to dust?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When this thought flashed through his mind, his heart suddenly tightened, and he couldn't even stand still, stumbling forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Big brother!" a cry of alarm rang out, followed by a pair of hands catching him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Big brother, what's wrong with you?" Jasper asked, stroking Mick's back. "You look terrible. You haven't rested properly these days. Why don't you take a break? I'll keep an eye on the search. If there's any news about Nancy, I'll let you know right away!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick suddenly grabbed onto Jasper like a lifeline. "Will there really be news about her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Jasper felt a pang in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The expression on Big Brother's face right now is like that of a person who is about to drown, struggling desperately, and begging to stay alive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Nancy really dies, what will happen to Big Brother...?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though reason tells her that Nancy's chances of survival are too small, Jasper says, "Yes, there will be news of her. Since Irene can survive, Nancy can definitely survive too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After hearing Jasper's words, Mick let out a long sigh and said in a trembling voice, "Yes, she will definitely survive, survive..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as he spoke, his voice choked up and he couldn't continue.</p></div>
