        <h1>Chapter 151</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even when she tried to kiss him, he would not allow her to do so.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That made her feel ill at ease. After all, he kept switching girlfriends. Everybody knew that he would get tired of whoever he was with every few months.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn was determined to capture his heart. She needed to get herself into his good books, as she wanted to continue staying by his side. The longer she stayed with him, the more things she could get from him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After getting used to the comfortable life that he had provided her with, she didn't want to go back to the kind of life that she had lived in the past.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Moreover... Evelyn glanced at Brian's good-looking face from the side. He could easily capture the average woman's heart, and she was no different.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She wanted to be close to him not only because of the good life that he could give her. She wanted him and desired to be intimate with him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When his almond-shaped eyes met hers, her heart would throb. She felt stirred up and desired him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would use any means to get hold of this man.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"My friend is here today. Let me introduce you to him." Brian's voice sounded in her ears.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sure," she replied submissively.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Needless to say, his friend would surely be wealthy and respectable!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, she was stunned when she saw Brian's friend!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is this man... Brian's friend? He resembles... the man I saw in Grace's rental apartment!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian's friend's attire was different and his bangs were styled back, revealing his smooth and full forehead. It was different from the man in the rental apartment who had had bangs covering his forehead.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"They may not be the same person!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As the thought flashed through her mind, Brian whispered to her, "Evelyn, this is Jason. You can offend anyone in Emerald City, but not him. If you do that, even I will not be able to protect you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although Brian was speaking to her nonchalantly, Evelyn felt thunderstruck.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian had been protecting her ever since they had gotten together, and he had never mentioned not protecting her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is this man Jason? The man who is well-known in Emerald City, but whose photo never appears online!?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason raised his brows lazily as he looked at Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn was quick to react. She immediately put on a smile and greeted him, "Mr. Reed, nice to meet you. I'm Evelyn."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason curled his lips and smiled derisively. "I see. It's you, Evelyn. I hadn't expected to meet you again."</p></div>
