        <h1>Chapter 1362</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a birthday celebration with just the two of them. Grace picked out a dress in the same color as the clothes Jason was wearing today and they went downstairs for breakfast together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had intended to cook their lunch herself, but he flat-out rejected the suggestion because she was pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He put it nicely by saying that he was afraid of tiring her out and used the kids&rsquo; well-being to pressure her. Grace could only think of putting her cooking skills to good use after giving birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had decided on the lunch menu herself, all of which were his favorite dishes. Besides, she had chosen the birthday cake as well. She drew a sketch and spent a lot of time communicating with the baker before finally finalizing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she presented the cake to Jason, the look of surprise on his face seemed to be the best reaction she could receive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you..." Jason looked at Grace, some surprise still evident on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you like it?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled, gently moved his thin lips, and uttered the words, "I like it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cake was designed to look like a small garden with a small house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the middle of the garden were two white-haired elderly standing hand-in-hand. Three people in the same outfits and many other smaller people in colorful clothes were around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On top of the cake was a message written in cream and chocolate. [Let&rsquo;s hold hands and grow old with each other.]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was his dream and hers as well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They would grow old together, and they would be surrounded by their children and grandchildren!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lit a candle for Jason. "Jay, happy 28th birthday!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Come to think of it, many things had changed in a year!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had just met her a year ago, but she had become his wife a year later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gazed at her. "Sis, I owe all my happiness to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the word &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; came out of his mouth again, Grace fell into a trance as though she had gone back to the old days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, compared to the old days, the way he was calling out to her today was full of tenderness and love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, make your wish and blow out the candles," she said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a smile on his lips, he gently closed his eyes and began to make a wish. Grace blushed slightly as she looked at Jason. What he had just said made her face red and her heart race.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he really owed all his happiness to her, then she was willing to make him happy for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The candlelight mixed with the dim lighting as they fell on his face, making his face appear more defined and mysterious. His long lashes cast a shadow over his lower eyelids. His straight nose and thin sexy lips were attractive. Just quietly looking at him was a visual pleasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, his eyelashes fluttered slightly and he slowly opened his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When those charming and bright eyes looked at her, her heart seemed to have been struck by something. He was probably the most beautiful being in this world.</p></div>
