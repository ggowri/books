        <h1>Chapter 2717</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope he can be happy," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had gone through thick and thin with her when she was younger. However, she was only a passerby in his life. Would Valda Theller be the one to accompany Brian all his life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to the study after the two children had gone to bed that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was having a video conference in the study. Grace crept in and sat on the couch. She watched Jason hold his meeting while holding her chin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was used to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was busy with his work. Even at home, he often needed to review documents and have video conferences with the senior executives of foreign branches.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He needed to lead such a large company. One could imagine how heavy the burden on his shoulders was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even so, he always tried to make time for her and the children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, she would occasionally wake up in the middle of the night and find him reviewing some documents even though he had gone to bed with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would say nonchalantly to her, "I just have a few things to finish, then I'll go to bed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At such times, she would regret that she could not help him with anything. She had suggested that she join the company to help him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. You'll have to learn a lot of things all over again if you come and help me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter. Even if I have to start all over again, I'm confident I can do well," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know. My wife is an excellent student, after all. Learning everything over again is easy, but business isn't what you like. Law is what you want to do with your life, isn't it?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I hope you can do what you love. All I'm doing right now is to provide a better life for you and our children so that you can do what you love. If you indulge me instead, everything I'm doing will be meaningless, won't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&rsquo;re working so hard, but I can&rsquo;t help you with anything,&rdquo; Grace said apologetically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You did help me out. Didn't you help me with the company's legal matters?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just a favor. Besides, the company already has a dedicated legal team," she mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When you have more experience in this area in a few years, you can take charge of the company's legal department. That&rsquo;ll help me share a lot," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Jason, who was having a meeting with foreign senior executives in German. 'Will I be able to handle the company's legal affairs in the future? Do I have the ability?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she shook her head to get rid of the uncertainty at the bottom of her heart. 'I can do it! I have the ability and confidence to do it well.'</p></div>
