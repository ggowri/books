        <h1>Chapter 1542</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, do you know how much I love you?" Grace could not help murmuring. She even had the urge to kiss him right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His long eyelashes fluttered slightly and he slowly opened his eyes. Those deep and glittering peach blossom eyes immediately caught sight of Grace's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned. For a moment, she felt as if she had been captivated by those eyes and was immersed in the glittering light in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then tell me how much you love me." His smooth voice rang in Grace's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She instantly paused and came back to her senses, "I..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How much do I love him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She loved him, so she could let go of all sorts of resentment for him. He had stood by and watched her go to prison when he knew the truth about her case, but... she could not stop wanting to be with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because she had never loved a man so much, nor had any man loved her this much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had also heard from Terrence that she fell into the ocean that year because she did not want him to die to save her, so she pulled the handbrake to back up the car and fell into the ocean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... he had no idea about this because he had forgotten all about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Can't you say it?" The corners of his lips were tugged upward. "That's right. If you loved me, you wouldn't have left, would you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Leaving... He probably thought I left of my own accord.' Grace felt as though there was a heavy weight on her heart, which almost made her gasp for breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If you really loved me, you would have stayed even though I had stood on the sidelines and made a mistake with your case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So it means you never loved me much. In that case, don't say anything about how much you love me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His words continued to ring in her ears as he spoke with a hint of irony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could not help biting her lip. What Uncle Kwan said earlier rang in her ears...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young Madam, Young Master's headache has to do with his lost memories. Young Master will often get terrible headaches whenever he recalls any memory of you. Dr. Guzman also said that everyone's constitution is different, so the body's response to memory recovery is different. Please don't tell Young Master the truth about how you fell into the ocean back then. Find an opportunity to reveal it little by little in case Young Master suffers too much stimulation. Otherwise, his body may not be able to take it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If it were not because she was worried he would suddenly have an unbearable headache, she would tell him everything&mdash;including what she remembered. She would tell him the truth about how she had fallen into the ocean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After she married him, she had never thought about leaving him&mdash;never!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I didn't leave because of what you think. I had&hellip; a reason." Grace paused and said, "Five years ago, you weren&rsquo;t the only one who lost your memory; I lost mine too. You only forgot what had happened between you and me, but I forgot who I was."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Surprise flickered in Jason's eyes when he heard that. 'She... lost her memory too?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"For five years, I was living as someone else&mdash;a struggling single mother with a child. You can look into it. I only remembered you about a week ago, but I couldn't get through to you by phone, so I brought our daughter back to Emerald City to look for you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said as she stared intently at the person before her. "Jay, believe me, okay? I didn't leave you because I didn't love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was because she loved him so much that she did not want him to die for her. It was why she had sacrificed herself and the lives of the three children she was carrying in her belly at the time.</p></div>
