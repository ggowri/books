        <h1>Chapter 3948</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy felt her heart skip a beat, a chill spreading from her spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I asked you, and you're asking me back...," she said awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's gaze flickered slightly, "If you do deceive and betray me in the future, I can spare your life, but only once."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy licked her dry lips, was this like a get-out-of-jail-free card for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if Mick found out one day that her love for him was a lie, he would still let her go?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But...if she really fell in love with him before he found out, then it wouldn't be a lie, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As this thought flashed through her mind, she immediately laughed at her own naivety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did she really want to fall in love with Mick? If she did, what would become of her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was only interested in her for the moment, could she really marry into a wealthy family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And what if she did fall in love with Mick, but he lost interest in her? How would she live the rest of her life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So the best outcome was to use his current interest in her to bring down the Schultz family and give Clarissa the punishment she deserved, to comfort her mother's spirit in heaven!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you thinking about?" Mick's voice rose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah, I just feel like with you by my side, I could walk sideways through Emerald City," Nancy said, quickly using vague words to cover up her true feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want to walk sideways, you certainly can," Mick said. "So, how do you plan on doing it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ahem!" She almost choked on her own saliva. "I...I was just joking. I don't really mean it..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Gurgle!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, her stomach made a loud noise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy stopped talking, feeling embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hungry?" Mick asked, looking at the time. "It's about time for dinner. Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy picked up her bag from the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick noticed that her shoulder bag was much fuller than usual, as if it was stuffed with something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's in there that's making it so full?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh, it's a small teddy bear! A colleague from the hotel gave it to me," Nancy casually mentioned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why did your colleague give you a teddy bear?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She accidentally bumped into me earlier, so it's a gift as an apology," Nancy explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for whether Irene really did it accidentally or on purpose, Nancy didn't feel the need to say it in front of Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night, after Nancy returned home and finished washing up, she casually placed the teddy bear on the dining table cabinet, unable to stop thinking about her conversation with Mick earlier that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Right now, Mick is treating her well, but how can she make him more interested in her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only when she asks Mick to help her seek justice for her mother, will he agree to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the following days, Nancy still worked at the hotel during the day, and would spend time with Mick after work or on weekends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes he would have work to do, and she would quietly play on her phone or games.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he was in the mood, he would play a game with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The games they played gradually shifted from the mobile games she played at the beginning to the new game his company was currently developing.</p></div>
