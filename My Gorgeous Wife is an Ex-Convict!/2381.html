        <h1>Chapter 2379</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... What happened to her finger? She used to have all ten fingers!" Kyla said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "She had already lost it when she was admitted to the mental hospital eight years ago. We don&rsquo;t know how she lost it.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm going to Deer City. I want to meet Amber Mitchell!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss rejected. "No! You're not in the right shape to travel."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I must go. I must find a way to get Amber Mitchell out!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to release Amber Mitchell, I can get someone to check her condition and assess her mental state before making the appropriate arrangements. But you can't go. What will you and the baby do if she's mentally ill and attacks you?" Martin Weiss said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell isn't mentally ill. How could she be? Something must have gone wrong! Didn't Jacqueline Bowman say Amber Mitchell is living a life more miserable than death? Yes... Jacqueline Bowman might know something! If Amber Mitchell is only an ordinary patient, why would Jacqueline Bowman use the phrase 'more miserable than death'?" Kyla said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss still said, "Whatever it is, I can find someone to take care of the matter in Deer City while you stay in Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla suddenly reached out and grasped Martin Weiss's sleeve. "Martin, please, let me go to Deer City. I can't be at ease until I see Amber Mitchell with my own eyes! I want to see her. I want to ask her what's going on. I want to bring her out of there!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla sobbed with teary eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Mr. Weiss, why don't you let Kyla go to Deer City? She can't take care of herself and the baby in Emerald City without worrying if she doesn't go. I'll speak to a maternity hospital in Deer City and ask the doctor in charge of Kyla to give them her medical reports for thorough preparation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace understood how Kyla felt. If she were in Kyla's position, she would probably rush to Deer City immediately!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's more, even if you don&rsquo;t let Kyla go, she&rsquo;ll find a way to go by herself. Wouldn't it be better to agree to it than to increase the risk?" Grace added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss gazed at Kyla's pained and anxious face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she care about Amber Mitchell that much? She&rsquo;s so panicked after just learning a small piece of news about Amber Mitchell. Has she ever worried about me like this?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss tried to think&hellip; if she had ever been in pain and gotten anxious for him. She had only shown such an expression when he went to save her after she was kidnapped by Mr. Lambert. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, he mistakenly thought she had feelings for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he later realized he was only imagining things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He already knew the gap in importance between him and Amber Mitchell to her, right? If he were half as important to her as Amber Mitchell was to her, she would never have let him be so disheartened that he would willingly choose to hypnotize himself so that he could forget his feelings for her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you're so desperate to go, I won't stop you. But I&rsquo;ll go with you," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're coming too?" Kyla paused.</p></div>
