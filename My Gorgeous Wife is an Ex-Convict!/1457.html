        <h1>Chapter 1456</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian stared at Grace for so long that some of the guests nearby looked over, muttering while wondering what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What's the matter? Brian, do you have something to say?" Jason asked coldly as he grabbed Grace's hand, which was also a deGracetion of ownership.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian pressed his lips together and walked away without saying anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Feeling relieved, Madam Hart quickly pulled Brian over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was also relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't worry. Nothing will happen." Jason's voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was stunned for a moment. She turned to look at the person next to her and heard him say, "It's Old Master Reed's funeral today. If Brian makes a scene at the funeral, then the Hart family and the Reed family will be at loggerheads. Besides..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He paused and grabbed her hand tighter. "He knows that he has no chance and that nothing will come of it even if he tries to do something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed's funeral proceeded smoothly. The heavily pregnant Grace persisted until Old Master Reed was buried. Then, she sat down and rested in the rest area set up outside the Reed family's cemetery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The three babies in her belly seemed to know that it was a solemn day today. Besides the necessary fetal movement, they did not cause her any discomfort. They were well-behaved today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace gently caressed her belly and told the babies about her day out of habit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, she sensed the bodyguards around her moving. She looked up and saw Brian standing not far away from her. He was being stopped by two bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is there a problem?" Grace asked slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian looked at the person in front of him. The scene of her looking down and speaking to the babies in her belly was imprinted into his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was a side of her he had never seen before. She would probably be a good mother when the children were born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was late at every step after being late just once!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had met her earlier than Jason, and he knew she was the one he wanted in his life sooner than the other man! However, with so many missteps, fate seemed to be ridiculing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How are you?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm doing very well," Grace replied without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian's eyes twinkled a little. "You'll never end up regretting marrying Jason, will you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As if somewhat amused, Grace asked, "Why should I regret it? Jay and I are doing really well. We have three children on the way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even if he..." However, before Brian could finish, another voice rang out and it was accompanied by rapid footsteps...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, I know the Stevens family and I did you wrong. But let the Stevens family off!" Sean said quickly as he rushed forward. Of course, he was also stopped by the bodyguards.</p></div>
