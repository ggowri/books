        <h1>Chapter 1471</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, didn't you say you would forgive me no matter what mistakes I make? You said you&rsquo;d forgive me as long as I cried. Then I'll cry. I'll cry, okay? I can cry however long you want me to and I&rsquo;ll shed however many tears you want me to shed. Please forgive me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He said. The tears were welled up in his eyes and streaked down his handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace only felt something blocking her heart and it felt uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She never thought she would see him cry under such circumstances.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His tears flowed down his cheeks, dripping on their hands, burning badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her other hand, which was not held by him, could not help moving toward his face. However, as her hand touched his tear-soaked face, a long-lost queasy feeling came over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace immediately covered her lips and pushed Jason away. She ran to the bathroom, leaned over the sink, and threw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had not thrown up like this for a long time since getting over her morning sickness, but now, she was throwing up like she was going to throw up everything in her stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace!" Seeing Grace throwing up like this, Jason instantly panicked. He subconsciously raised his hand and touched Grace's back, hoping to soothe her and make her feel comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, when his hand touched her back, she threw up even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't... Don't touch me..." Grace finally caught her breath, raised her hand, and pushed Jason's hand away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When he was no longer touching her, she slowly stopped vomiting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked up with a pale face and wiped her mouth. She looked at Jason. Her almond-shaped eyes seemed to sparkle with a hint of sarcasm, mocking both him and herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her lips parted slowly, and he suddenly seemed to have guessed something. His face turned horribly grim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Don't say it... Don't say it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was screaming frantically in his heart, but he still heard her say with a miserable laugh, "Even if I... can tell you that I forgive you, but... my body can't seem to do it. Tell me, what should I do... What should I do..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Whenever he touched her, her stomach would churn and she would throw up. Even though she tried to suppress the feeling, her body seemed to instinctively trigger the reaction. She could not control it at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stumbled a little. His face was now full of despair!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The doctor came in the middle of the night and examined Grace. Finally, he concluded that it was due to an instinctive resistance and no specific medicine could be prescribed for this. It was just like how the body would instinctively protect itself once it encountered danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace gave a wry smile at the doctor's conclusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Was it because her body had suffered too much in prison? Her body had suffered through all sorts of inhuman torture, so it began to resist Jay&rsquo;s touch as well when she found out about the truth.</p></div>
