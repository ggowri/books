        <h1>Chapter 929</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it because of Jason? Because I believe he&rsquo;ll save me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but smile wryly as she thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She intended to be independent, but now she was dependent on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver drove toward the south of the city, to an increasingly remote place, They were going to leave the city soon!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know what Jason planned to do, but the car suddenly stopped when it was about to reach the highway exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you stop?" the man who was watching over Grace at the back asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the driver did not answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As such, the man glared at Grace. "Be good!" Then, he moved forward after getting up halfway and poked his head out between the seats to look through the windshield at the front of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the man stiffened. His face showed a stunned expression while his body could not help trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's going on?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was lying in the car with her hands tied. She could not straighten up at all, let alone see out the front of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a loudspeaker outside blared. "Those in the car, you're surrounded. Give up and don't hurt the hostage. If you don&rsquo;t follow our orders, you'll only be hurt or killed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. 'We're&hellip; surrounded?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did Jason do this?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the door was opened by men in police uniforms who quickly took the two men out of the car. Next, a figure caught Grace's eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Jason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at Jason's handsome face. When he saw her current state, his face was so dark as if he was going to kill someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't come over!" Jason said suddenly. Then, he quickly got into the car, undid the rope that tied Grace's hands, and took off his suit jacket to put it on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who did this? Or are they both involved?" Jason raised his hand and gently touched the slap mark on Grace's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Both of her cheeks were red and swollen from being slapped so many times earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gasped. It was only now that she felt the pain in her cheeks. "It's... the one without a mask," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you hurt anywhere else? Did they&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No! I just... suffered a couple of hits," she said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together as he bent down to lift her out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had not seen what was going on outside the car until she was carried out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was no wonder that the two men were shocked as rows of police officers armed with real ammunition and police cars had almost completely blocked the highway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like they were dealing with a nefarious criminal organization or even a major international criminal case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ordinary kidnappings would not face such a commotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was also shocked. She did not expect Jason to make such a big deal out of it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men who had been handcuffed by the police immediately widened their eyes when they saw Jason coming over with Grace in his arms.</p></div>
