        <h1>Chapter 1335</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was the first to come back to his senses and said as if he understood something, "What's the matter? Are you here to pick up your fianc&eacute;e, Chairman Ye?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you, Master Reed? Are you also here to pick someone up?" Martin Weiss asked instead of answering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm here to pick up my wife and her friend." Jason smiled faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned. Paisley Daniels had not said much on the phone just now. She just said something happened and she was at the police station. She was even sobbing a little, so he did not ask and rushed over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after hearing what Jason said, Martin Weiss felt a thump in his heart. Kyla Corbyn's face came to his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is... Kyla Corbyn at the police station too?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Martin Weiss was about to walk inside, Jason suddenly said, "I heard Kyla Corbyn offered you custody, Chairman Ye. Aren't you curious why?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why...' Martin Weiss thought about what Kyla Corbyn said on starting a new life and marrying and having children with another man. He immediately found his teeth tingling. "I didn't expect you to enjoy gossiping too, Master Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said with a half-smile, "I hope you won't regret having put Kyla Corbyn in prison with your testimony, Chairman Ye." With that, he moved his feet and walked in first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was never interested in other people's business, but... seeing what was going on with Martin Weiss and Kyla Corbyn made him think of his situation with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The difference was that Martin Weiss had directly pushed Kyla Corbyn into prison while Grace's imprisonment was the result of him coldly looking on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned. 'Regret? How could I possibly regret it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla Corbyn deserved to be put in prison. She was only sentenced to three and a half years in prison for taking a life. She had it easy!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he seemed to feel an indescribable pain in his heart once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Martin Weiss walked inside, he saw Kyla Corbyn sitting in a chair. Her hair was a little messy, and her face seemed to be somewhat bruised. Her thin body made her tattered taupe-colored clothes look even more terrible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is she here? What the hell happened?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Martin Weiss was lost in thought, Paisley Daniels flung herself into his arms in tears. "Martin... You're finally here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss came back to his senses and looked at Paisley Daniels who was in his arms. "What happened? You didn't make it clear on the phone just now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels looked up and deliberately showed Martin Weiss her swollen cheek. "I just went to the food stall today and told Kyla Corbyn that I've let go of the past. I told her I'll take good care of Nelson and treat him as my own son. Then she just slapped me in the face!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tears once again poured out of Paisley Daniels's eyes as she spoke, and she put on a pitiful look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said coldly at the side, "Miss Daniels, why aren&rsquo;t you telling him that you got some thugs to create trouble at the food stall and instructed them to kick and punch Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's pupils immediately shrank, and his face darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels immediately said, "I... I don't know those people at all. Don't simply accuse me! Kyla Corbyn probably offended those riff-raffs, and they came to pick a quarrel!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll find out the truth after the investigation. I'll take Kyla to the hospital for her injuries. Paisley Daniels, if you have something to do with this, then you can expect the indictment," said Grace.</p></div>
