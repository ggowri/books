        <h1>Chapter 1876</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This time, Grace did not ask for a driver but drove off alone in a car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She drove to the destination. Jason's men were quite surprised to see her. "Young Madam, what are you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I&rsquo;m here to see my mentor and his wife. Is there a problem with that?" Grace asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But Young master Reed..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How could I have found this place if Jay wasn&rsquo;t the one who told me my mentor and his wife are here? Get out of the way!" snapped Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">These people knew how important Grace was to Jason. They dared not say anything more and stepped aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace entered the shabby apartment, only to see her mentor sitting on the chair beside the bed with one hand tightly holding Mrs. Watts's hand. His head kept nodding. He was obviously extremely sleepy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts lay on a broken bed. She was probably asleep but did not seem to be sleeping well. Her face was flushed as she panted for air. Her hair was stuck to her forehead due to the sweat. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace stepped forward and reached out her hand to touch Mrs. Watts's forehead. She felt her palm burning, and her action startled Old Lawyer Watts, who woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace? Why... Why are you here?" stammered Old Lawyer Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's a long story, Mentor. I'm taking Mrs. Watts to the hospital right now," said Grace. Mrs. Watts's condition would probably worsen if they did not get to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts quickly asked, "Has... Has Jason forgiven my wife?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace shook her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts was disappointed. "I'm afraid Mrs. Watts won't want to leave here. She said that if Jason doesn't forgive her, she won't leave even if she dies here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I knew it!' It was exactly as she had suspected. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mentor, are you going to watch Mrs. Watts die?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Of course... Of course not. But you know how stubborn Mrs. Watts is. Besides, perhaps Mrs. Watts will be sent to prison if we leave!" Old Lawyer Watts said awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On one hand, his wife did not want to leave, and on the other hand, he was afraid that his wife would go to prison and spend the rest of her life there. Therefore, he could only hope that his wife could recover from her fever on her own, or Jason could take their mother-son relationship into consideration and forgive her as soon as possible. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, as her fever persisted and the temperature grew higher, he became frightened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">During the day, he had tried to persuade his wife to go to the hospital but she said, "I... I'm not leaving... If&hellip; If you take me to the hospital before Jay forgives me, I... I'll never forgive you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After learning about Mrs. Watts's unwillingness to go to the hospital from her mentor, Grace frowned deeply and finally said as if she had made up her mind, "I'm the one who&rsquo;s taking Mrs. Watts to the hospital. It has nothing to do with you, Mentor. Mrs. Watts can just hate me if she wants to!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said as she helped Mrs. Watts out of bed and let Old Lawyer Watts put Mrs. Watts on her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts opened her eyes in a daze, subconsciously struggling. "Who... I... Don't touch me. I... I'm staying right here. I'm not going anywhere. I... I'll wait until my son forgives me... I... I'll wait for Jason..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "Mrs. Watts, it's me! Jay... told me to take you to the hospital!" She could only lie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts stopped struggling. "Has... Has he forgiven me?"</p></div>
