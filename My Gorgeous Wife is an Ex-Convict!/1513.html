        <h1>Chapter 1511</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This was why she had to seize the opportunity no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch thought determinedly. A beautiful smile bloomed on her face. She was already a pretty woman, and she had a great figure too. If she did not have a nice body, she would not have been able to attract the gaze of that rich nobleman in the past. She also would not have ended up getting herself pregnant before marriage just to have a baby which would be her ticket into a rich family. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Unfortunately, her expectations were shattered. Although she was pregnant with a child, the rich family did not give her a single chance. They did not care at all even after she gritted her teeth and gave birth to a daughter. They merely told her that the child was none of their business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Mr. Reed, you&rsquo;re back. Nana was just saying that she misses you. She just had to come here to see you, so I brought her here,&rdquo; Irene Lynch said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch had also walked to stand in front of Jason as if she wanted to hug the man. At last, she stood some three steps away, intimidated by the man&rsquo;s gaze. She said timidly, &ldquo;Daddy, Nana misses you.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason&rsquo;s gaze swept over both mother and child. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s late. You should go home.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;But&hellip; Tonight Nana wants&hellip; Nana wants to sleep with Daddy tonight. Can I?&rdquo; The five-year-old Oriel Lynch opened her eyes wide, reciting the lines to her father just as her mother had told her to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mommy said that she had to work hard to make this adopted father like her so that he would become her real daddy. If that happened, she would finally live a comfortable life where she could wear nice clothes and eat good food. It would be a life where everyone would still treat her like a princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch did not really understand what it meant for him to become her &lsquo;real daddy&rsquo;, but she wanted to become a princess. She did not want to be looked down on like she was now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jason said flatly in response, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to sleep with someone else on the same bed. I&rsquo;ll have someone send you home. You should call me &lsquo;Mr. Reed&rsquo;, not &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo;.&rdquo; Mick was the only one who could call him &lsquo;Daddy&rsquo;. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch was so intimidated by Jason&rsquo;s coldness that she ended up not saying anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch bit her lip and said, unwilling to admit defeat, &ldquo;Mr. Reed, Nana hasn&rsquo;t had a father since she was young. She likes you, so she&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch&rsquo;s voice gradually softened as she spoke. At last, under Jason&rsquo;s icy stare, she went quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, she felt like this man had seen through all her thoughts! There were no emotions at all in this man&rsquo;s gaze!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if this man would not fall in love with anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Uncle Hartan, send them home,&rdquo; Jason told the butler, who was standing nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the butler said. He then turned to the two. &ldquo;Miss Lynch, you should return with your daughter. Mr. Reed is going to rest for the day.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After meeting so many people, the butler obviously had a clear idea about what Irene Lynch was planning. Sometimes, when one managed to obtain all that they could not have possibly achieved before, they would become greedier. They would want to have more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Irene Lynch, in the butler&rsquo;s opinion, was too greedy. She was also fortunate, however. After all, her daughter had been chosen by Mr. Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No, to be precise, her daughter had become Little Young Master&rsquo;s substitute younger sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hearing the butler&rsquo;s words, Irene Lynch could not bring herself to say anything more. Ashamed, she could only leave while holding her daughter&rsquo;s hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason walked up the stairs and came to his son&rsquo;s bedroom. He opened the door to see his son on his chair playing with a jigsaw puzzle. He was deep in concentration. After catching sight of Jason, the tutor quickly got up and greeted respectfully, &ldquo;Mr. Reed.&rdquo; </p></div>
