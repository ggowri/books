        <h1>Chapter 1388</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the empty feeling in his hand made Martin Weiss fall into a temporary trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin..." Paisley Daniels's anguished voice interrupted his trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss quickly crouched down beside Paisley Daniels and looked at the mess Paisley Daniels was in. Her face was so pale that it almost had no color, and even her lips were trembling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin, I... I just wanted Nelson to meet my parents. I thought of... being a good mother, but... But I really didn't expect it to turn out like this. I..." Paisley Daniels spoke with difficulty as if she was innocent and kind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Paisley Daniels frowned, and the look of pain on her face became even worse. "Ouch... Martin, my stomach hurts..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned. "Alright, stop speaking. I'll send you to the hospital right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Martin Weiss picked Paisley Daniels up, he realized that the bottom of Paisley Daniels's dress was stained red with blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels was wearing a white dress today, and the blood seemed even more shocking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Daniels and Mrs. Daniels looked alarmed. "Why is there blood? Paisley, where did Kyla Corbyn hurt you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was also surprised. Paisley Daniels had just fallen, so she should not be bleeding that much even if the things on the table had fallen on her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Kyla Corbyn stiffened. The scene reminded her of what had happened back then again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, Paisley Daniels had fallen down the stairs and blood also stained her skirt. She made a look of pain and then went to the hospital in Martin Weiss's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How similar is this scene and that scene?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is... Paisley Daniels up to the same thing again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Kyla Corbyn only felt a chill creeping all over her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was stunned when he saw Paisley Daniels's blood. He quickly picked Paisley Daniels up and hurried out of the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he left the private room, he suddenly turned his head and said to Kyla Corbyn, "Kyla Corbyn, if anything happens to Paisley, it won&rsquo;t be enough even if you die 10,000 times!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at the man in front of her. 'Even dying 10,000 times won't be enough? It seems that this man really has no mercy for me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, the man had also held Paisley Daniels in the same way and spoke harshly to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all these years, nothing had changed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels was precious to him, while she was nothing but mud on the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was just glad she had taken off her son's hearing aid and Nelson could not hear any of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Paisley Daniels is unworthy of my death," she said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." He glared at her fiercely but was shocked when he saw her sunken cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When did she... become so thin? She seems thinner than when we were at the amusement park last time. Even the bones in her fingers that are holding Nelson have become so obvious.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly thought of the moment he had grabbed her wrist earlier. 'It was really... thin. Much thinner than back then!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A stinging pain slowly spread in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin, why did you stop?" Mrs. Daniels's voice rang out.</p></div>
