        <h1>Chapter 1439</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could now do all the things she previously never had the time to do due to her busy life these years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing that it was almost time, Kyla Corbyn told Mrs. Corbyn and headed out to the kindergarten to pick up her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not notice a car not far behind following her in silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss looked at Kyla Corbyn who was walking. His heart was feeling bitter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not want to see him again. She was even disgusted with his presence, so he could only look at her in this way. He had no idea how to make her accept his liver donation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had only told him, "Kyla had made up her mind. I'm afraid it's hard to make her change her mind now. We have to think of other ways. If you really want to save Kyla, be ready to donate your liver at any time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Of course, he wanted to save her, so he gave up drinking and had a nutritionist prepare his meals. He wanted to make sure his liver was in its best condition!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss just continued driving as he watched Kyla Corbyn get on the bus. He followed the bus and watched her get down before walking to the kindergarten gate. She waited with many other parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Among the group of parents, her figure seemed particularly thin and her face looked a little dull. She seemed gaunt and sick, but her clothes were clean and tidy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though she was ill, she still paid attention to her appearance. He knew since she was here to pick up her son, she did not want other parents to look down on him because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sometimes, even Martin Weiss found it a bit sad and ridiculous when he thought of it. 'My son is being looked down on?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But I'm the cause of all this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Nelson could have had the same hearing as a normal child. He should have been born with a silver spoon in his mouth and lead a luxurious life, but now...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before long, Martin Weiss saw the kindergarten gate open. The teacher led a group of children to the gate and the parents led the children away, one by one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, he saw Nelson with his head down. The teacher seemed to be talking to Kyla Corbyn, while a parent seemed to be scolding Kyla Corbyn aggressively. It looked like they would not give up easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss immediately frowned. There seemed to be some dispute!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at the visible bruises on her son's face. It was normal for children to fight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, her son had fought with other children because of her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The parent's words were even harsher. "What's the matter? My son wasn&rsquo;t wrong. Your son is a bastard. The things you&rsquo;ve done were all posted online. Martin Weiss would rather get two-timed on than marry you and give the child a lawful identity! Then again, why would a rich man marry a woman who has been to jail?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you done?" Kyla Corbyn's face darkened, and she said, "Is it right of you to criticize my child and me because of online gossip?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So what if I'm criticizing you? I'm not slandering you. I'm telling the truth!" The parent looked arrogant. "You'd better ask your son to apologize to my son, or your son can forget about staying in this kindergarten!"</p></div>
