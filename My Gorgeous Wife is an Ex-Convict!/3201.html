        <h1>Chapter 3199</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the day of the formal wedding, the whole city was bustling with excitement. Online, there was an overwhelming amount of information about the wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, how could the wedding of a prince in the entertainment industry not attract gossip? Especially when the bride is a Cinderella with a limp, it's just like a fairy tale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the online reputation has been slowly changing over the past six months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda has become a role model for many ordinary girls. After all, many people hope to be Cinderella and have their own prince, and Valda has given these people hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Who says a prince can't fall in love with an ordinary girl!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even more, Valda has a limp leg, but the prince still loves her and doesn't regret marrying her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Besides the attention on the newlyweds, the guests at the wedding were also impressive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Almost all the celebrities in Emerald City and big names in the entertainment industry came to attend the wedding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The streets outside the wedding hotel were already lined with safety barriers and security guards, but there were still many people who came to watch on both sides of the hotel entrance, desperately taking photos with their phones or cameras as the celebrities arrived in their cars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially when those stars got out of their cars, their fans shouted their names loudly, making the scene almost as exciting as a red carpet event.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And at this moment, in the dressing room, Valda is wearing her wedding dress, looking at herself in the mirror with exquisite makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wedding will be held soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She is already familiar with the wedding procedures and even rehearsed a few times yesterday, so she shouldn't make any mistakes. However, she suddenly became nervous at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As time passed, the tension seemed to become even heavier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Why do you look so serious?" Camille walked into the dressing room and gently patted her friend's shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing, just... I'm a little nervous," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah, it's normal to feel nervous for your first wedding. Don't worry, everything will be fine. Brian will be by your side soon, so you don't have to worry," said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although that may be the case, Valda's sense of tension is still difficult to eliminate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, your wedding today was like a grand event in the entertainment industry. I wonder how many people will envy you. Even at award ceremonies, you don't see so many big-name celebrities," Camille exclaimed. "Do you think if I ask for autographs, they will give them to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda said, "You'll definitely get their autographs if you wear this bridesmaid dress. After all, they have to show some respect no matter what."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda is certain about this point.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," Camille said, checking the time. "We have 20 minutes until the admission time. Do you want to use the restroom or anything?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need," Valda shook her head, her face looking a bit pale due to nervousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go outside and check the situation first," Camille said, walking out of the dressing room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, there were only Valda, the makeup artist, and a few assistants in the dressing room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The makeup artist checked Valda's makeup and then had an assistant bring in the wedding shoes, preparing to help Valda put them on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, the dressing room door was pushed open and Brian walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian said to the others, "You guys can leave, I need to talk to Valda alone for a few minutes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But the wedding shoes..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll help Valda put them on," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So the makeup artist and the assistants left the dressing room one after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, only Brian and Valda were left in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian crouched down in front of Valda and picked up one of the wedding shoes. He carefully put it on Valda's foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, they took another wedding shoe and put it on her other foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda stared at the man squatting in front of her, feeling a bit dazed. In this world, he was the man who easily surrendered his emotions to her, and the man she would cherish for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he finished putting on her wedding shoes, she asked, "How did you come in? Weren't you supposed to be outside greeting the guests?"</p></div>
