        <h1>Chapter 3046</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasmine was so young that someone took her away, and to make matters worse, she was a premature baby! Premature babies are already weaker than full-term babies, and we don't even know what the person who took Jasmine away wants to do with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And the thought of her carefully protected daughter being stuffed into a large backpack and carried out by Whitney without any crying from the baby made her even more uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I am afraid that my daughter may have encountered some unfortunate event!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason and Philip are both using their connections and resources to search the entire city for Whitney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And Brian naturally began to use his network of connections at Deer Capital to search for the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For him, the guilt in his heart is far greater than Philip's, because Whitney is the person he saved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, the police found a new lead that someone had helped Whitney with the kidnapping. In fact, a few days ago, Whitney had rented a house near the Barlow family with that person to observe their situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian caught sight of the figures renting the house with Whitney, he was suddenly startled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That is... Phoebe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe was actually the one who conspired with Whitney this time! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In an instant, Brian's body trembled slightly as he realized that both Phoebe and Whitney, the two women behind this plan, were somehow connected to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could it be...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Jason also recognized Phoebe, after all, she used to be part of their circle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason knew that Phoebe had always had a crush on Brian, and it was because of him that the Cross family recently went bankrupt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked towards Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked deeply guilty, "I'm sorry, I didn't think that the two of them would get together. I will do everything in my power to find Jasmine, I will..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Find it. What if you can't find it? Brian, what responsibility can you take for my daughter?" Jason said in a cold voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." Brian trailed off, speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, this matter has nothing to do with Brian. Don't take it out on her. Right now... the most important thing is to find Jasmine..." Grace said tearfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Jason hugged his wife, looking at Brian, and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nonsense.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's face turned pale, but he couldn't say anything to refute it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, how could it be irrelevant?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Cross family is the one he caused to go bankrupt, and Whitney is the one he rescued while abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And both of these women know that Grace is the woman he loves. They secretly took Grace's child away, and he is inextricably linked to them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian suddenly stood up and walked towards the outside of the house. He couldn't bear to stay inside and watch Grace's tear-streaked face any longer. It made him feel suffocated and unable to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Brian left the room, Valda quickly followed him outside. She saw him walk to the wall and then fiercely pound it with his hand.</p></div>
