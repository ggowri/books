        <h1>Chapter 4136</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The female anchor curiously asked, "Miss. Stephenson, are you really Kit's fan?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina answered generously, "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Kit is really lucky. I wish I had fans like Miss. Stephenson," the female anchor said with starry eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina almost choked on her drink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The female anchor had introduced herself earlier as the type of anchor who creates a rich and beautiful image.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had shown Tina various videos and posts, all filled with luxury goods and exquisite afternoon teas, the panoramic view from luxurious hotel rooms, and so on...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The other party probably intended to establish a closer relationship, but Tina didn't feel anything at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Basically, it is impossible for her to become a fan of this female anchor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just then, another big shot raised his glass towards Kit, "Come on, Kit, I heard from your father that you're going solo soon, and he also told me that your image suits our company's products. After seeing you today, I think it's true. So how about next year, you become the spokesperson for our company! I guarantee that the endorsement fee won't disappoint you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit stood up and said, "Thank you, Mr. Perkins!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I've given you all the endorsements for the company, so you should at least drink three glasses!" Mr. Perkins said with a grin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And the others joined in, "Kit, quickly toast Mr. Perkins three times! You know, Mr. Perkins used to hire A-list celebrities as endorsers for his products!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit's body stiffened slightly, but he still wore his usual smile on his face. "Of course."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">With that, he raised his glass, filled it up, and toasted Mr. Perkins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">For him, this kind of thing was nothing out of the ordinary. Ever since becoming an idol, socializing like this was inevitable. He had smiled and drank like this many times before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But never before had he felt this awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was as if his limbs had become stiff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was it because Tina was here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Because of her presence, because she was watching him at this moment, it made him feel uncomfortable. It was as if the layer of glamour and brilliance he had in her eyes was slowly fading away, replaced by the ugly truth, bit by bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">One glass, two glasses...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The discomfort in his body became more and more apparent, making him feel nauseous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even if his gaze didn't meet Tina's, he could feel her eyes fixed on him, right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Stop looking, don't keep looking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He screamed desperately in his mind, not wanting her to continue seeing him like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as he was about to drink the third glass, a hand suddenly stopped in front of him. Tina had somehow walked up to his side and said in front of everyone, "Let me drink this third glass for him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The crowd looked surprised, as if they didn't expect Tina to step in and help Kit with the alcohol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was Austin who reacted first, smiling and saying, "Almost forgot, Miss. Stephenson is a fan of Kit. It's a great story for a fan to drink the third glass of alcohol for their idol!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">What a story, Tina thought to herself, she just felt that Kit's face was becoming paler and if he kept drinking, something bad might happen to him. That's why she wanted to help him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had just poured herself a full glass of alcohol and was about to drink it, but another hand stopped her!</p></div>
