        <h1>Chapter 2143</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's face could not help but redden. It did not matter if they were alone, but Kyla and Martin Weiss were also here. What she did made him a little embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However... He was also a little reluctant to push away Lina's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, stop messing around. Your friend is still here," reminded Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina finally withdrew her hand somewhat reluctantly and said to Kyla and Martin Weiss, "Grace came this morning and told me you&rsquo;ve been helpful when I was unconscious these days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How are you now? What did the doctor say?" Kyla asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"There's nothing wrong with the preliminary tests. There are some scans that I need to do in a couple of days when I feel a little better," said Lina. She looked at Kyla's belly. "Kyla, what about you? Have you gone to the consultation you mentioned?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The consultation is tomorrow," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said nothing. After all, they would only find out whether Kyla's results were good or bad tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They chatted for a while. Kyla could see that Lina was a little tired, so she got up to bid goodbye and left the hospital with Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As usual, Martin Weiss sent Kyla back to the store. "I'll pick you up for the consultation at the hospital tomorrow," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said nothing. She unbuckled the safety belt and got out of the car, but Martin Weiss understood that she had tacitly agreed. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The specialist at Municipal Women's Hospital would give a formal opinion on how risky the pregnancy was tomorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What if the risks are too high but she still insists on having this baby? What should I do then?' Martin Weiss was confused and at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car stopped at the store&rsquo;s entrance while he fell into a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At night, after Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney left, Lina looked at Hadwin Stephenson and suddenly said, "I heard Grace say you promised the little boy that he could marry Tina just so he would save me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson instantly stiffened, and he seemed flustered. "I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he had no idea what to say after stuttering for a long time. He could only clench his teeth and say, "You can blame me, scold me, and beat me. You can punish me however you want, but you can't leave me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's heart ached even more when she saw his appearance now. She raised her hands and gently cupped his cheeks. "Why would I blame you, scold you, and beat you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Because... I... I made this decision without discussing it with you," he said hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's because I was in a coma. How could you have discussed it with me?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"And... I... I took the liberty of deciding Tina's future. Maybe she&rsquo;ll fall in love with someone else in the future, and maybe this deal will be cruel to her." He went on.</p></div>
