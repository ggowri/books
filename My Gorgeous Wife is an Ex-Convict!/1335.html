        <h1>Chapter 1334</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels trembled with rage, and her anger was beyond control. "Kyla Corbyn, you're good. Just wait and see!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She made a call as she spoke. Soon, a few thugs came over and started chasing the customers away. They made trouble and flipped tables at Kyla Corbyn's food stall while Paisley Daniels just sat on the sidelines, smiling as she looked on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only table the thugs did not disturb was the table where Paisley Daniels was sitting. They were clearly the help Paisley Daniels had summoned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One of the thugs even went straight to Kyla Corbyn, kicking and punching her. Even though Kyla Corbyn tried to resist, she still failed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Soon, Kyla Corbyn was knocked to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thug kicked Kyla Corbyn with his feet and swore, "Are you f*cking blind? Don't you know who you can and can&rsquo;t mess with? We're teaching you a lesson today, so keep your f*cking eyes open next time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn clenched her teeth tightly. Even then, she did not beg for mercy. This was her last move to keep what was left of her dignity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the force that was hitting her was gone and she heard the thugs' shrieks as well as Paisley Daniels's screams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What happened?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn was stunned. Then, she heard a familiar voice. "Kyla, are you okay? Are you hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn saw Grace appear in front of her, reaching out her hand to help her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How did you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I came to see you," said Grace. She wanted to persuade Kyla about the custody case again, yet she unexpectedly witnessed such a scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment, the female bodyguard named Huang Qian who followed Grace around had already knocked the thugs to the ground and was grabbing Paisley Daniels who was trying to sneak away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me go! I can sue you for grabbing me!" shouted Paisley Daniels, but she could not break free at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What a coincidence. I'm going to sue you too," said Grace before taking out her phone and calling the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace! There's no need to call the police." Kyla Corbyn hesitated a little. She did not seem to want to make things worse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Kyla, if you don't call the police this time, then they'll only be more fearless next time. The law requires evidence. Even if Paisley Daniels wants to sue you for something, it&rsquo;s a fact that you were beaten. The injury report will serve as evidence. It's always better to be prepared."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn said nothing more after hearing that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The police came and took everyone to the police station to take their statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the police station, Paisley Daniels denied knowing the thugs and sued Kyla Corbyn for slapping her. Grace assumed the position as Kyla Corbyn's lawyer, claiming that Paisley Daniels slandered Kyla Corbyn's son first and those thugs were the help Paisley Daniels summoned. Paisley Daniels was the one who instructed them to create trouble for Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the police could only make a record and detain those trouble-making thugs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason received a phone call from Grace, telling him that she had to give her statement at the police station and might be home late, he immediately asked which police station it was and drove over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he got out of the car and walked to the police station's entrance, he met Martin Weiss who was also there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two were stunned as they faced each other, obviously not expecting to meet each other here.</p></div>
