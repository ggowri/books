        <h1>Chapter 2528</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Haven't they defined Herman Moss's death as an ordinary car accident?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could I have anything to do with Herman Moss's death? Have you gotten the wrong person? I want my lawyer! I'm suing the police for resorting to force without grounds," said Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can see your lawyer after you get back to the police station with us! And we wouldn't be arresting you like this if we didn't have enough evidence," the police said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Enough evidence?' The statement shocked Louise Mitchell. She wondered what evidence the police had at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Louise Mitchell was taken away from the airport, the subordinate called George Gregory, who was on his way over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Gregory, Mrs. Gregory has been taken away by the police. I vaguely heard Herman Moss's name being mentioned. It seems Mrs. Gregory has been taken away because of the car accident that year," the subordinate said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That car accident shocked the entire city back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's pupils constricted. "What did you say? She was taken away under suspicion of being related to Herman Moss's car accident?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems so. I was a little far away and didn't hear very clearly," the subordinate said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the phone call was over, George Gregory closed his eyes, pondered for a moment, and said to the driver at the front, "Turn around and go to the police station!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to find out what happened. How was Louise Mitchell involved in the car accident?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if there was a layer of mist before his eyes. He was getting so close, as though he could finally see everything if he stretched out his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Louise Mitchell was taken to the police station, she found Amber Mitchell there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell looked at Amber Mitchell walking toward her in shock. 'Why is Amber Mitchell here? Is this a coincidence? Or...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I told you that you could get away with it once, but that doesn't mean you can get away with it the second time," Amber Mitchell said coldly to Louise Mitchell. "Louise Mitchell, I won't let you get away with it this time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell, you..." Louise Mitchell suddenly felt a sense of fear. She had a bad feeling. Amber Mitchell already knew what had happened in the past. Louise Mitchell probably would not be able to get away with it again this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was taken to the interrogation room, while Amber Mitchell entered the statement room. She retold her story to the police, explaining every detail and doubt she had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time she came out of the statement room, tears were streaming down her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She raised her hand and gently wiped away the tears on her face. It turned out Herman's accident still hurt her so much and the memory had never faded even after so many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Herman asked her to live a good life, but could she really have &lsquo;a good life&rsquo; after losing so much?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, there was suddenly the sound of footsteps. Amber Mitchell looked up only to see George Gregory walking quickly into the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory stopped abruptly when he saw her, and surprise flashed across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing here?" George Gregory asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm here for the same reason as you are," said Amber Mitchell. They were here because of Louise Mitchell! </p></div>
