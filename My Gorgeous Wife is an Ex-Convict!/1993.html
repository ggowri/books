        <h1>Chapter 1991</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was a tall man with a somewhat cold and feminine face. He gave William a strange sense of familiarity as if he had seen the man's face somewhere before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was too young to know that the sense of familiarity was due to his own resemblance to the man in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're William and you're five years old this year. Your mother is Lily, right?" the man asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked at him warily. "Who are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm from the Barlow family of Deer City, Philip Barlow," the man said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Anyone else would probably be surprised to hear this name. Philip Barlow and the Barlow family were well-known in Deer City. The Barlow family's status in Deer City was tantamount to the Reed family's status in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, for a child such as William, he did not understand the weight of those words. His eyes were still full of caution. "What do you want to do? Are you... Are you going to tell the other kids in kindergarten that my mother was a criminal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That was the greatest threat to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not care that others would laugh at him or even treat him maliciously when they found out that he was the son of a criminal. He just did not want Jasper to fight others for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing her getting hurt from fighting made him feel worse than if he were to get himself hurt! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm not that bored to tell other kids such a thing. I just want to tell you that I'm your biological father. I came to Emerald City to take you away," Philip Barlow told him his reason for coming here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked at the man before him with shock. His young voice asked the question in disbelief, "You're my... daddy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," Philip Barlow answered affirmatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But why are you my daddy? Mommy never said my daddy's name is Philip Barlow," he said. His mother also said the man called Sean was his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the man was not his father. His mother had lied when she said they were father and son. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It has been medically certified. If you still don't believe me, I can take you to Emerald City's hospital to have another test." Philip Barlow tried to speak in a way that kids his age could understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William was silent. Although he did not know what this test was, he believed... in the hospital!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If the hospital confirmed that we're father and son, then... it should be true. Is he... really my daddy?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Although you're living in the Reed family&rsquo;s house, you're just relying on their charity. Not to mention your mother had hurt the Reed family's mistress, Grace, many times. Your life in the Reed family&rsquo;s house must be hard. Follow me back to the Barlow family. I can let you live the same life as the heirs of the Reed family. No one will dare criticize you over there, let alone disrespect you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What Philip Barlow said sounded like a fantasy to William. Confusion flickered in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow chuckled, which slightly relieved some of the sternness on his face. "What's the matter? Don't believe me? In Deer City, the Barlow family isn't inferior to the Reed family. Once you're in Deer City, you'll naturally be the young master of the Barlow family! Come back to Deer City with me. I'll take care of everything. You can have anything you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow said as he reached out one hand to his son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This child would be his only child. He would take good care of him and nurture him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the little one unexpectedly did not put his hand in his. The expression on his face was obviously one of... rejection!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Yes, rejection!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What Philip Barlow had said was a great temptation to children like William, but it did not work the way he expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow said, "Don't you want to return to Deer City with me? Once you're in Deer City, you'll have a bunch of people waiting on you. You can have the best piano, the best teachers, and any toy you want."</p></div>
