        <h1>Chapter 1981</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson frowned. "What, were you hoping to do other things as well?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Uh... forget I said anything.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As a result, Hadwin Stephenson spent the rest of the morning discussing with Lina the distance she should maintain with her idols.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the afternoon, Lina continued to stay in Hadwin Stephenson's office. She ate snacks and drank bird's nest. She was having the time of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The senior executives and secretaries who often made trips to the president's office had also gotten used to it. They were even respectful to Lina. Anyone could see that she was probably the future mistress of the Stephenson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When people finally stopped going in or out of the office, Lina suddenly stopped. She seemed to stiffen and look down at her belly in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter?" Hadwin Stephenson immediately noticed her strange behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though he was working, he would look at her from time to time and keep an eye on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked up at Hadwin Stephenson while blinking. She saw Hadwin Stephenson putting down the pen in his hand. He got up and hurried toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I think... the baby just kicked," she murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson suddenly stopped. Then, the two of them just stared at each other. "The baby kicked?" His voice was a little out of tune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was not that he did not know what it meant. He knew that she was pregnant and that it was normal for the baby to kick this far along in the pregnancy, but... he had an indescribable feeling when he related the baby's movement to the woman in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson went up to Lina, sat beside her, and stared intently at her slightly bulging belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hey, they're kicking again. Touch my belly!" Lina suddenly shouted and pulled Hadwin Stephenson's hand to her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Instantly, he felt a slight movement in her belly through the thin layer of clothing. It was so slight it was easy to ignore. It was a wonderful feeling that made him realize that her belly was carrying a tiny human life. It was a tiny human life that belonged to both of them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hey, I learned online that the baby's movements would feel like bubbles being blown. I didn't know it was true. Is this baby blowing amniotic fluid bubbles in my belly..." mumbled Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson quietly felt the baby's movement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, there was suddenly a knock on the office door. The secretary opened it and hurried in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson frowned slightly, and the secretary momentarily froze after seeing what was going on. Then, they quickly said, "President, there's news... about Miss Sweeney online. Some reporters have gathered downstairs, but the security guards have stopped them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"News?" Hadwin Stephenson's eyes glimmered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina asked in surprise, "News about me? What news? Where can I read it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Miss Sweeney, just check XX's trending post if you want to read it," the secretary said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina immediately turned on her phone and looked for the trending posts. Then, she almost choked when she saw the trending post about herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She immediately tapped on it to take a closer look. Anthony Sherman had posted a post on Weibo claiming that the girlfriend he got to know on a blind date was pregnant with his baby but she left him for a rich man. She told the rich man that the baby was his, making him misunderstand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Anthony Sherman wondered if he should tell the rich man that the woman's unborn child was not his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Onlookers found out Anthony Sherman's so-called girlfriend was actually Lina, and some people posted recent photos of Lina and Hadwin Stephenson together. Her baby bump was somewhat obvious now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hence, they confirmed Lina and Hadwin Stephenson were the pregnant girlfriend and the rich man mentioned.</p></div>
