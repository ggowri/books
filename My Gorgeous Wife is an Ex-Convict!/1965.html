        <h1>Chapter 1963</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he flung her away with one hand. "Don't mind me... Don't come to my room again tonight!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">For the past two nights, she would come to his room with the pregnancy pillow in her arms. If she came to his room again tonight, he might...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's come over you? Did you drink too much at the party? Or is something else the matter?" She instantly tugged on his arm, unwilling to let him leave without an explanation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, it was his birthday today. She bought the cake with great difficulty and did not even have a bite with him yet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stiffened. When she approached him, his arm felt the tenderness of her body. Her scent and the concern in her eyes seemed to imperceptibly fascinate him, breaking down what was left of his sanity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't touch me..." he said with a gasp, his face getting paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even his handsome features were slightly distorted as he tried to control the urge in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the more he acted like this, the more worried she became. "What happened to you? If you don't feel well, I'll go to the hospital with you, or I can ask your family doctor to come over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I said no!" He immediately snapped as if he could no longer resist the urge in his body. He seized her jaw and kissed her hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her lips were soft with her unique scent and sweetness. They seemed to be enticing him to want more... More... He needed to fulfill the burning desire he felt at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was like a nomad dying of thirst in the desert and found water. He wanted it at all costs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was his water, making him want more...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Rip!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He tore the neckline of her dress, and goosebumps appeared on her fair skin from the sudden exposure to the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He ran his lips along her lips, then kissed her neck, her shoulders...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina only found Hadwin Stephenson's lips shockingly hot. He left kisses on her as if he was raining flames down on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What the hell is going on here? He's unlike his usual self!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin... Hadwin... What happened to you?" shouted Lina as she tried to break away from him, scared that his intense kisses would hurt the baby in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he seemed to turn a deaf ear and kept on demanding. When her hands tried to push him away, he easily clamped her wrists and twisted her hands behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her body was forced closer to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His lips went even lower...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even if Lina was stupid, she knew what might happen later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could do it if she were not pregnant, but she was now pregnant. Hadwin also seemed a little different than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, all her struggles seemed so futile. If this went on...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was so anxious that she cried out, "No, Hadwin. No... I'm scared. I'm scared..."</p></div>
