        <h1>Chapter 4316 Nothing Can Change Anything</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where to?" the driver in the front asked Calvert for his address.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert took a while to come to his senses and then provided the address.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>20 minutes later, the taxi stopped at the entrance of a run-down alley in Emerald City. Calvert got out of the car and looked at the old houses in front of him. There were many beggars along the way, and trash was scattered everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This place is known as the gathering place for the poor in Emerald City and is jokingly referred to as the slums of Emerald City. And he, grew up here since he was a child.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was young, he didn't think much of it, but as he grew older, he realized that people are truly different from one another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He used to believe that as long as he worked hard and had good grades, he could change everything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He studied hard and made sure his grades were always good, wanting to prove that even if he was born poor, he could still make something of himself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when he entered university, he realized that the gap was much bigger than he had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because of his excellent grades, the school waived his tuition fee, allowing him to attend this prestigious university.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But it was precisely because of this that the disparity became more apparent. He discovered that there were many things that even good grades couldn't change!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he walked into his old, dilapidated house filled with a smell of decay, he saw his father rummaging through boxes and cabinets, angrily muttering, "Why don't we have any money? Why can't we find even a single penny?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing this scene, Calvert knew that his father had probably lost in gambling again. So now he was at home searching for money, wanting to find some to continue gambling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you steal my money, you brat?" As soon as his son came back, Calvert's father immediately grabbed his collar and loudly questioned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert coldly replied, "Do you think you still have money for me to steal?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening to Calvert's words, Calvert's father forcefully pushed him away and said, "You, if it weren't for me, how could you grow up like this? It's all because I raised you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, he continued searching in the house. Suddenly, Mr. Elledge seemed to have found something, a look of excitement flashed across his face. He grabbed that thing in his hand and hurriedly left!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert noticed that the pendant his father had just found belonged to his mother in the past. It was made of silver and wasn't worth much, but for his father, even a little money was good </span><span>at a time like this. It was all he had for gambling!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Facing a father like this, it's no wonder that his mother escaped from this household and even left him behind!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Taking a glance around the dimly lit house, Calvert silently took out the medicine that Harley had given him from his pocket.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this the compassion of the wealthy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That princess, so high and mighty, never would have expected to have any connection with someone like him one day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the intersection, that's as far as it goes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, the current life is just barely surviving, and each day on campus only makes him realize that he can't change anything, including his own life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Three days later, Tina and Lornell crossed paths, and Lornell handed her a pill.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Take it!" Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina took the pill without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This action surprised Lornell a bit. "Aren't you going to ask what this pill is?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since it's medication given by the Quentin family, there's no need to ask. If anything happens to me, you'll be implicated too," Tina replied.</span></p></div>
