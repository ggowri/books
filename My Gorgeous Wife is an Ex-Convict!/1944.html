        <h1>Chapter 1942</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Wait...' Lina suddenly realized that her phone was not in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She suddenly got up and felt relieved when she saw the phone on the coffee table. However, she seemed to think of something and quickly picked up her phone. She opened the photo album to take a look...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina immediately found herself blacking out as she almost choked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Where... Where are the photos of him in the photo album on my phone? Are they gone?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I just saw them before I fell asleep!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina took her phone and quickly walked up to Hadwin Stephenson's desk. "Did you delete the photos on my phone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just deleted my photos. Can't I delete my own photos?" Hadwin Stephenson asked nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..." Lina's eyes immediately reddened. "Do you know those photos are..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "I only know those photos are photos of me. Also, I don't want anyone to disturb me when I'm working."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze and finally sat back on the couch silently. She was happy when she woke up because he had covered her with a thin blanket, but all the happiness had turned into sadness now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Those photos were so precious to her. They were memories she had with him! What would she be left with if she did not have these memories?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked at her phone, sniffling from time to time. Her shoulders twitched as if she was suppressing her sadness and trying hard to restrain the tears that were about to pour out of her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The way she looked made Hadwin Stephenson feel that he had done something wrong. She did not cry, but he felt worse than if he were to see her in tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson forced himself to look down at the document in front of him. However, all he could think about was the other person in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At noon, Hadwin Stephenson did not invite Lina for lunch but went to lunch alone. When he returned to the office, Lina and the bag she was carrying today were gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Did she... go to lunch?' Hadwin Stephenson speculated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when Hadwin Stephenson came back after a meeting at about four, Lina's figure was still missing from the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes glimmered a little. &lsquo;Did she leave and will never return because I deleted those photos in the morning? That's great if that's true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'At least I'll have some peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Didn't I already know that? She has always been impatient. Just like when she promised to wait outside the house that night but by nine o&rsquo;clock, she was all packed up and ready to leave. This time, she said she wanted a month, but perhaps she&rsquo;ll back off in less than a day!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina never appeared when it was time to get off work, and Hadwin Stephenson left the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car drove toward the Stephenson family&rsquo;s mansion. Hadwin Stephenson looked out of the window in boredom but suddenly froze when he saw a figure on the roadside by chance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was Lina!</p></div>
