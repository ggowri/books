        <h1>Chapter 812</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, once she moved her body, there was a pain in the left side of her waist where the man had kicked her, making her brows furrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it painful?" The cold voice once again rang in her ears. Then, the beautiful hand rested on her waist where it hurt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's body stiffened immediately. She felt as though all the blood in her body was rushing to that one spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face got closer to hers. It was so close that she could see his long black lashes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Sure enough... They're beautiful!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They seemed to touch people's hearts every time they quivered gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was probably how her once stagnant heart was touched, but now it had become stagnant again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine." Grace steadied herself and calmed down. "Thank you for your help, Mr. Reed. I... I'm alright."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she raised her hand to pull the large hand on her waist away, little by little. Then&hellip; she let go and wobbled in the direction of the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason's hand remained in the air in the same position as when Grace pulled it away just now. It was as if time had frozen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand seemed to retain her warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The moment he saw her, he almost could not help walking up to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw that she was kicked by the man, his mind almost went blank. He was left with only a desire to kill!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had told himself over and over again not to care about her. 'But when I saw her, I still find myself caring about her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t we already broken up?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Master Reed," said Terrence. After all, there were a lot of customers around, and the club's manager as well as security guards had all come over after hearing the commotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they saw that it was Jason, the manager and the security guards did not dare to say anything. They just stood beside him quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She called me Mr. Reed just now," Jason said this suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only Terrence understood the meaning of his words, but even someone as smart as he did not know how to answer him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, although Master Reed and Miss Cummins had broken up, the scene just now was enough to let people know that Master Reed still cared about Miss Cummins from the bottom of his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, with Master Reed's character, he would not even bother to look at someone who got kicked until they got fractures in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me go. Do you know who I am? I'm the young master of Feng Lai Group. What are these security guards doing? Won't you save me? I'll tell my dad about this when I go back. He'll raze this Drunken Days to the ground!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The drunk man was still yelling and making harsh remarks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the club manager and security guards did not bother about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What did it matter if he was the young master of Feng Lai Group? Could he compare to Master Reed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Jason's unconcerned words instantly made everyone look at the young master with sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Jason said was&hellip; "Cripple whichever leg he used to kick just now."</p></div>
