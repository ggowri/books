        <h1>Chapter 2773</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect them to cross paths again... so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, so what if people who were destined not to be with each other crossed paths? They would still be like two intersecting lines that intersected briefly before separating further...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stewart Watson gaped at the stack of information on his desk. He had no idea who put them there, but they were about Rhea Oliver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The contents were so unsightly that Stewart Watson gasped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought Rhea Oliver was only slightly unruly and conceited, but Rhea Oliver had been with many men before dating him. She even had two abortions in the hospital!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The information included the name of the hospital, the name of the surgeon, and even the exact time of the operations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stewart Watson almost could not believe it was true. After all, Rhea Oliver would behave innocently in front of him. She even said he was her first official boyfriend. Besides that, they had only held hands, hugged, and kissed while they were dating. She said she was conservative and would never cross the line if they were not married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought she was chaste after hearing her say that. However, who knew she was only lying to him? Just then, a servant knocked on the study's door, walked in, and said to Stewart Watson, "Young Master, Miss Oliver's here to see you. She said it's urgent."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stewart Watson immediately told the servant to let Rhea Oliver into the study after hearing that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Rhea Oliver entered the study, she rushed into Stewart Watson's arms. "Stewart, help my family out. A business deal my family had settled on suddenly went sour, but we've ordered the goods with the downstream manufacturers. My family can't afford the losses now that the business deal is suddenly gone. Why don't you ask your father to intercede for my family? It's Yan Hai Group. Isn't the president on good terms with your father?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Stewart Watson pushed Rhea Oliver out of his arms and looked at her. "Tell me how many boyfriends you&rsquo;ve had first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver immediately said, "You're the only boyfriend I've ever had. Don't you know that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've only had one boyfriend but you&rsquo;ve slept with several guys before? But you kept talking about saving the best first time for after we got married," Stewart Watson said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver's eyes glimmered as if she was in a panic, but she quickly calmed down. "What are you talking about? Did someone slander me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Rhea Oliver, do I need to tell you what you've been keeping from me? Five years ago, you had an abortion in a private hospital. Three years ago, you had a second abortion. Do I need to tell you exactly when and by whom these surgeries were performed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stewart Watson's statement surprised Rhea Oliver. Her calm expression finally broke down, and she panicked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why? I hid everything well. How did Stewart find out?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stewart Watson's heart instantly sank after seeing the look on her face. He was skeptical of the authenticity of the information at first, but Rhea Oliver's expression was telling him the information was real. He did not even have to look into it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Rhea Oliver, how dare you?! You fooled me like I'm an idiot!" Stewart Watson yelled.</p></div>
