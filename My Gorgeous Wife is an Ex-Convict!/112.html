        <h1>Chapter 111</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily asked him a series of questions and each of them made Sean's face turn paler.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's enough, these things don't have anything to do with each other. You need to stop asking," Sean said vaguely.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily was not willing to comply. "Sean, we are engaged, and it won't be long before we get married. Is there anything between us that we can't talk about?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean hesitated. Of course, he wanted to confess. After all, the matter regarding Jason and Grace had been a weight on his mind.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Especially these days, his parents had been worried that he was still in love with Grace, so they had been nagging him not to go and see her again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But he had long since stopped having feelings for her!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had to force himself to not say anything, but at the same time, he also worried about Lily getting the wrong idea.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Lily, there are some things that I can't say." Sean took a deep breath.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily stared at him and said, "Does Zoe's injury have something to do with Grace?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean looked at his fiance&#769;e in surprise and could not speak. His expression convinced her that she was right.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So it really does have something to do with her. Don't tell me that Grace got to know some people with a background of being in prison?" Lily continued to guess.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, before Sean could answer, a voice suddenly rose. "Well, isn't that just great. So it turns out that I got injured because of Grace!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe limped over. Originally, she had just wanted to call her brother and Lily to return to the main hall, and she had not been expecting to hear this.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Speaking of getting injured, she was terribly depressed. Her feet were broken, and she had suffered a lot in the hospital. She had become a joke among her friends.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And in the end, not only had she been unable to find out who had made her like this, but she had also been unable to attend her brother's engagement party.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had a belly full of anger. She was furious when she heard that Grace had sent someone to deal with her. She wanted to find Grace immediately and settle the score.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Brother, if you keep speaking up for Grace, I will not recognize you as my brother anymore! I don't know when my foot will recover, and it might not even heal completely in the future. Brother! Grace sent people to hurt me. I have to cripple her leg, otherwise, I might as well change my surname!" Zoe said ruthlessly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she spoke, she took out her mobile phone, looking as if she wanted to call for assistance.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"As I said before, if you want to live peacefully, don't bother Grace!" Sean exhorted.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why? Who does she think she is? Do you think that I'm afraid of her? Does she think it's enough to find some people she knows in prison to help her?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's right. After all, Zoe is the young lady of the Stevens family. If she does not retaliate when being bullied, then everyone would walk all over the Stevens family's head in the future," Lily said, speaking up for Zoe.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What do you all know? It's Jason who's behind Grace!" Sean blurted this sentence out in response. As soon as he said it, his face turned pale.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This matter had actually been revealed by him. If Jason were to find out about it...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Like him, Lily's and Zoe's faces also looked pale.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was Jason?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How is this possible? How could Jason have helped Grace? Back then, she caused Jennifer's death!" Zoe said in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean said straightforwardly, "Believe it or not, it's true. Jason may have taken an interest in Grace. In short, Zoe's injury this time should also be the work of Jason. In addition, it's Jason who said that he didn't want Zoe to attend the engagement party."</p></div>
