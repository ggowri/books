        <h1>Chapter 1747</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The hair was for them to test the DNA to see if the kidnappers were telling the truth!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's heart instantly sank, and Uncle Kwan nervously asked, "Young Madam, is this true?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I don't know. I'll call Jay! Uncle Kwan, prepare a car. I need to head out," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," said Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two children came to Grace's side and watched curiously. Jasper was still a little confused and did not seem to understand, but Mick Reed did. The little one pulled a long face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mommy, have you found Lil Bro?" asked Mick Reed after immediately thinking of the remaining triplet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Maybe. I have to go out. You and Jasper stay at home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Will Lil Bro be alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, I'll make sure he's safe!" assured Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace told the driver to drive toward Mason's house as she called Jason. She had just briefly explained things when Jason said, "Don't worry. I'll save our son no matter what it takes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Our son?" Grace froze. "How do you know he's our son?" After all, what was written on that paper had not been verified yet and everything so far was just her speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, do you remember when I accompanied you to meet Mason at the entrance of the primary school? I was already suspicious then, so I got someone to take Mason's blood for a DNA test. To be on the safe side, I chose three labs, locally and from abroad as well. All three reports have confirmed that Mason is our child," Jason said on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace instantly burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Mason's... really our child! But I didn&rsquo;t recognize him until now! Isn't there a saying that a mother and child are linked by their hearts? Why didn&rsquo;t I, a mother, recognize my own child?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had watched Mason get scolded and attacked by other older children. She had also seen him covered with bruises...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Those scenes were constantly playing back in Grace's mind, piercing her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If... she had recognized Mason earlier, would he have suffered less?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She wished to be able to suffer the pain her son endured in his stead. He should not have had to go through all that at his age!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, nothing can happen to Mason. Nothing! I... I failed to protect him. If I had insisted on adopting him and bringing him back to the Reed family, maybe he wouldn't have gotten kidnapped!" said Grace as she choked up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, stop crying. I won't let anything happen to Mason. Trust me!" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace sobbed. "Okay, I trust you. I trust you... I... I'm going over to Mason's place to make sure he's really... been kidnapped."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, the note did not say who the child was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay, I'll be right over too," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the call was over, Grace burst into tears again. When she heard Kyla talk about Mason previously, there was nothing but sympathy in her heart&mdash;sympathy for the child who was suffering from all these at such a young age.</p></div>
