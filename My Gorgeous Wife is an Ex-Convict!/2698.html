        <h1>Chapter 2696</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The atmosphere instantly turned weird as soon as Phoebe Cross said that. The crowd that had been laughing and talking fell silent as everyone looked this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller felt embarrassed. She did not expect to be asked about this on this occasion. She could feel that the woman in front of her was looking at her without any kindness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to embarrass Brian. At the very least, she was now his nominal girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, Valda Theller met her eyes. "I'm the one involved in the viral post you mentioned. I'm the comic artist. But what the viral post wrote isn't true."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh? So the whistleblower created a rumor? Miss Theller, why don't you tell me what isn't true and save me from being misled?" Phoebe Cross said with a faint smile. She was only waiting for Valda Theller to take the Stephensont so she could embarrass her more. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you can be misled by such a stupid article, I'll have to reconsider the project that Song Yuan Group is going to cooperate with Hart Group on." Brian's voice rang suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross's expression changed slightly. Brian's phoenix eyes glanced at her coldly before he turned to Valda Theller and said, "You must be thirsty. What do you want to drink? I'll pour it for you," he said as he led her to the bar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their group disliked having staff in the private room, so no one was working at the bar. However, drinks and liquor were available, and they could pour them themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just... Coke will be fine." Valda Theller saw the vintage bottled Coke at the bar and could not help feeling nostalgic. Her parents used to buy her Coke in these glass bottles when she was a child. However, one could not find Coke bottles like this on the market anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his eyebrows slightly and said, "Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He grabbed a bottle opener and skillfully opened the cap. Then, he put a straw in the Coke bottle before handing it to Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sight of it carried a lot of meaning to the others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross's expression turned more ghastly. Patrick dragged Phoebe Cross to the corner and whispered, "What are you doing? Brian finally brought his girlfriend here today. Do you have to embarrass her like that?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That woman is only a comic artist. Who is she to be Brian's girlfriend? Is she good enough for him?" Phoebe Cross snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick said earnestly, "It&rsquo;s Brian's business whether she's good enough. Is Grace, whom Brian used to love, someone great? But Grace could make Brian and Jason fall for her. Relationships are never about whether someone is good enough for the other!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Phoebe Cross's expression looked even more hateful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick patted her on the shoulder. "I thought you had put it behind you. It's been years. Brian would&rsquo;ve been with you if he wanted you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong with me? Why would he rather get a woman like Valda Theller to be his girlfriend than me?" Phoebe Cross snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew about the time Brian loved Grace. Grace was the one he had been looking for for years, and she had nothing to say about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Grace got together with Jason afterward, Brian was still obsessed with Grace and never kept other women around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only stay with him as a friend and business partner. However, as long as he did not date other women, she would eventually be the only woman for him!</p></div>
