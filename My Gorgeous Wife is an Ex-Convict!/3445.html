        <h1>Chapter 3443</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The girl angrily turned to Veronica and said, "It's you! You're the one who's been stopping Mason from having a girlfriend. You pretend to be his sister, but behind the scenes, you're blocking him from finding a girlfriend. What's your real intention?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica is confused and her ankle is hurting badly at the moment. The culprit behind this pain is still here, scolding her. She gets angry and responds, "Who are you? It's none of your business whether Mason has a girlfriend or not. My intentions are my own and have nothing to do with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You--" The girl seemed even angrier now, raising her hand and preparing to hit Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as his hand was about to touch Veronica, it was grabbed by another hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you doing?!" Daniel's voice raised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The girl's expression changed slightly, as if she was a bit frightened by Daniel, but then she spoke fiercely, "What are you doing, protecting this girl? She's not a good person. She always obstructs her supposed younger brother from finding a girlfriend. Who knows what dirty thoughts she has in her mind!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're so dirty!" Daniel said angrily, "Which class are you from? I'm going to find your homeroom teacher. You intentionally hurt someone, let's see how your homeroom teacher deals with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The girl's face suddenly showed a hint of panic, and then she forcefully pulled away from Daniel's hand. "You...you're not into this girl, are you? Let me tell you, liking girls like her won't end well. Be careful not to get cheated on in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel raised his hand and slapped the other person directly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The crisp slap caught the attention of those around them. The girl looked incredulous and asked, "Did you just hit me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I hit you!" Daniel said bluntly, "I'm Daniel from Class 3 of Grade 10. If you want to find my homeroom teacher, feel free to do so! And yes, I like her. So what? My fate is not up to you to decide. If you dare to say anything bad about her again, I will still beat you up. I won't go easy on you just because you're a girl."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person was a bit frightened, their lips moved slightly, but ultimately they didn't dare to say anything and hurriedly ran away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel quickly turned around, crouched down, and asked Veronica with concern, "How are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay, just a little painful around my ankle," she said, trying to stand up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Wait a moment, let me take a look first," said Daniel. He carefully pulled up Veronica's pant leg and gently pulled down her sock. Then, he saw that her ankle was swollen and red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Daniel touched her, Veronica winced in pain and took a sharp breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon seeing the situation, Daniel immediately said, "Go to the medical room and have a look."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," she said, trying to stand up again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the next moment, he lifted her up horizontally in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You--" Veronica stared blankly at Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll carry you over, it'll be faster!" he said, quickly picking up Veronica and heading towards the medical room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Along the way, Veronica felt like she was constantly being looked at with strange eyes, and she was afraid that by tomorrow, she would become the subject of gossip again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel brought Veronica to the medical room, his face slightly flushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The doctor in the clinic examined Veronica and said, "Fortunately, there's no problem with your bones. It's just a sprain. Apply some medicine and avoid running and jumping for a few days."</p></div>
