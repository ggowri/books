        <h1>Chapter 800</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz's eyes lit up and she became instantly excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace came out of the interview, she met Andrea Schwartz head-on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, why are you here for an interview? Does your boyfriend know? If you want to become a lawyer again, your boyfriend can just give you a law firm with the snap of a finger, can't he?" Andrea Schwartz said with a fake smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The colleague beside her was surprised after hearing Andrea Schwartz's words. She looked at Grace and said, "Andrea Schwartz, are you kidding me? Her boyfriend can casually give her a law firm?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could I joke about this?" Andrea Schwartz explained kindly, "Her boyfriend is Jason. Jason can easily give her a law firm in Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she said this, it brought a burst of laughter from the people around her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Andrea Schwartz, are you sure? Her boyfriend is Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if you're joking, there are limits to it. If her boyfriend really is Jason, then my boyfriend is Brian!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's right. Hey, as lawyers, we must base everything on evidence. If Jason hears about this, he may sue you for defamation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not joking. It's true." However, Andrea Schwartz continued seriously, "Grace, say something, lest others think I'm joking. Isn't Jason your boyfriend? He even takes great care of you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more serious Andrea Schwartz was and the more she praised Grace, the louder the laughter around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace glanced coldly at Andrea Schwartz, knowing that the woman was doing this just to embarrass her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went straight past Andrea Schwartz, intending to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz could not miss this opportunity. She immediately grabbed her and said, "Hey, Grace. Tell me, am I right? Isn't Jason your boyfriend? You can't let others laugh at me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the surface, Andrea Schwartz seemed to be defending Grace, but in fact, she wanted to find out whether Grace was still Jason's girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at her with a cold, calm look that seemed to see through people. "It seems to me that you really enjoy turning me into a joke. Looks like you haven't changed one bit even after going to a different firm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Andrea Schwartz's face turned red immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How many people who could stay at this firm were rookies? After hearing this, those who were laughing gradually came back to their senses. The way they looked at Andrea Schwartz was not the same as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not bother to pay any attention to Andrea Schwartz's schemes. She just shook off her hand and walked out of the firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz stared hatefully at Grace's leaving figure. 'I wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed wrong. Grace must&rsquo;ve broken up with Jason. Otherwise, how would she wear such shabby clothes? She looks worse than an ordinary passerby!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the receptionist seemed to recall something and said, "Huh? Grace can&rsquo;t have a boyfriend. I asked her if she was single when I called her for an interview yesterday. Lawyer Carter said he doesn't want a paralegal who is married or likely to get married within two years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, in principle, the people who came to the interview today should be single people with no dating life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz once again got excited at this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm right. Grace has been dumped by Jason! So what if Grace was once Jason's girlfriend?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She's worse than I am now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Apart from Jason, even Brian, the crown prince of the entertainment industry, defended Grace! However, judging from those trending searches on the internet, it seemed that the crown prince had a new love interest&mdash;a woman called Stella.</p></div>
