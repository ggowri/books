        <h1>Chapter 413</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These videos were no longer online, but... she did not want to hide this matter from him. After all, they were a couple now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Today..." Grace told Jason about the dispute that happened earlier today, including how Brian had helped her out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she finished talking, she did not see any shock or surprise on Jason's face. She could not help asking, "Did you know about this already?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I've seen the video of the incident you mentioned," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she was the one who was surprised. He saw the video she... did not even see!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"About that video... I have nothing to do with Brian." She subconsciously feared that he would misunderstand, so she took the initiative to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, according to Kyla, when the video was published, many of the comments below were speculating about her relationship with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sat on the edge of the bed with his hands around her waist. His chin was slightly tilted back as he looked at her. "You're not attracted to Brian, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course not," she said. Speaking of which, did he know how attractive he was right now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked so different from how he was in front of others. How many people could see this side of him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if he's attracted to you?" His eyes seemed to darken as he looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He is?" Grace was stunned before lightly saying, "He's Evelyn's boyfriend. Besides, even if he had any interest in me, he still wouldn&rsquo;t be the one I like."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason narrowed his eyes a little. She said &lsquo;wouldn't&rsquo;, not &lsquo;couldn't&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In other words, even if she did not like him, she would not be attracted by Brian. Just because he was Evelyn's boyfriend?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't like someone who keeps changing girlfriends. I think he has no respect for feelings. Women are probably something to spice up his life. He can be interested in you one day and someone else the next," said Grace. She thought of Brian as more of a playboy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A playboy who never got emotionally involved in his relationships.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes glistened and he smiled. "From now on, you can only be attracted to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Brian... She would never know that Brian had only been looking for traces of her in all his short-lived girlfriends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, when Grace got back to the small restaurant, Kyla Corbyn looked at her and asked, "Are you feeling under the weather today, Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" Grace asked in confusion as she looked up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your face looks very red," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace subconsciously touched her face and said, "Maybe I got sunburnt on my way here today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The real reason was that before she went out this morning, Jason had gone down on one knee to tie her shoelaces before she could tie them herself. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After tying, he even bossily announced that only he could tie her shoelaces from now on.</p></div>
