        <h1>Chapter 3592</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She shook her head innocently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So how did you end up in those photos with him?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jasper pursed her lips and didn't hide anything from Mick. She explained how she had suspected Roger was Lawrence, approached him, and obtained a DNA sample.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So, he's not Lawrence?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No, he's not," Jasper said. "I was the one who kept mistaking him for Lawrence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But what if the DNA test showed that he was Lawrence? Between him and William, who would you choose?" Mick asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Wha...what?" Jasper suddenly became stuttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What, William hasn't confessed to you? I thought he would have made a move after entering college," Mick said casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jasper's face turned red all of a sudden, and for a moment, he didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Looking at his sister's appearance, Mick said thoughtfully, "It seems that he has made a move. What about you? Haven't you accepted?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jasper was taken aback, "You know he likes me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mick rolled his eyes and said, "Everyone knows he likes you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm not talking about just a normal liking, but...you know, the kind between a man and a woman," she said, afraid of her older brother misunderstanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm talking about the liking between a man and a woman. Otherwise, what do you think I meant?" Mick said. "Anyone can see that he likes you in that way."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jasper blinked her eyes. Was she really too slow to realize it? If William hadn't explicitly said it, she wouldn't have thought about it in that way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So, did you say yes to him or reject him?" Mick continued to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jasper looked embarrassed and tried to change the subject, "Brother, when did you become so nosy?" Normally, his brother didn't like to listen to this kind of emotional gossip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I just feel sorry for William," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sorry?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, he likes someone, has liked her for so many years, but he never dared to confess. Isn't that pitiful?" Mick said, at least in his opinion, he couldn't do it himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But on second thought, how many people can keep a secret crush in their hearts for so many years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jasper was still thinking about what his elder brother had said until he boarded the plane the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Is it pitiful...when everyone knows that you like someone, except for the person you like? It sounds quite pitiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had said that he liked her for a very, very long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">And then, without realizing it, their feelings had developed into a romantic attraction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she still only saw him as a childhood playmate, without ever considering anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's wrong? Why are you staring at me like that?" William, who was sitting next to her, asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"N-nothing, I was just thinking...you like me, but I had no idea. Do you feel sorry for yourself?" She immediately felt uneasy after saying this and quickly added, "I was just talking nonsense. Just forget what I said!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">As she spoke, she hurriedly picked up the nearby water glass and drank from it, almost burying her face in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He saw this and smiled slightly, "I don't think I'm sorry for myself. I'm happy to like you."</p></div>
