        <h1>Chapter 1051</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went up to Paisley Daniels and Martin Weiss. "Hello, Mr. Weiss and Miss Daniels!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's you." Martin Weiss looked at the woman in front of him with some surprise. He had seen this woman several times before. He remembered that she was Jason's woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she brought Nelson with her last time. In other words, she knew Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn suddenly passed through Martin Weiss's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm Grace, the lawyer representing Ms. Kyla Corbyn in her custody case." Grace introduced herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she said Kyla Corbyn's name, the expression on Paisley Daniels's face suddenly changed. "What are you doing here? Did Kyla Corbyn ask you to plead for her? We won't budge on the child's custody. He&rsquo;ll only lead a miserable life with her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Paisley Daniels's face. Paisley Daniels was not stunningly beautiful. She was good-looking, but with a delicate look that aroused men's desire to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, Miss Corbyn didn't ask me to plead for her. I came here to see you, Miss Daniels," said Grace as she stared at Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Me?" Paisley Daniels was slightly stunned. "I don't think I have anything to do with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "How could it be? You&rsquo;ve been sending people to disrupt the business at Miss Corbyn's food stall. I just wanted to ask when are you going to stop, Miss Daniels?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Grace said this, Paisley Daniels frowned and said, "I don't know what you're talking about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you won't admit it, then I have no other way but to submit the evidence to the police. I'm afraid that the Daniels family will be embarrassed, and even the Weiss family's reputation will be slightly affected," said Grace. She did not have any evidence at all. She said that only to put on a bluff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels's expression immediately changed. "How can you possibly have evidence..." She made a conscious attempt to say no, but as soon as the words came out, she realized she had spilled the beans.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss narrowed his eyes coldly and looked at Paisley Daniels. Paisley Daniels bit her lip awkwardly, putting on a pitiful appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "You'll know whether I have evidence when we get to the police."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at Martin Weiss again as she spoke, "I thought that you&rsquo;d fight for custody fair and square and not with such petty behavior, Mr. Weiss. Otherwise, even if you win the case, I wonder what Nelson will think if he finds out his father used such despicable means."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face darkened immediately. "What's the matter? Are you threatening me, Miss Cummins?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said calmly, "It's not a threat. It's only a piece of advice! I don't know what you have against each other, but people who never experienced it wouldn't understand the pain of a woman suffering in prison for more than three years and even giving birth in prison.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The expression on Martin Weiss's face turned gloomier, and there was a glint in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's all I'm saying. I just want you to stick to the case and not behave pettily. Unless... you don't think you can win the case, so you're trying to win it by using such ways," said Grace. She spoke her last words to goad him into action. She did not know if it would work on Martin Weiss.</p></div>
