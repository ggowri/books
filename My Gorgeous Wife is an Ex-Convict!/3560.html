        <h1>Chapter 3558</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could it be possible! How could Roger possibly like her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the way they interacted, she couldn't tell that he liked her at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, William's forehead furrowed as he stood up and walked over to Roger. "Please don't make jokes like that," he said sternly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger's gaze shifted to William's face, as if seeing his old self through the familiar features.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, he dared not speak out of turn in front of this man, always trying to please him because Mr. Barlow was the childhood friend of the Reed family's eldest daughter and someone he couldn't afford to offend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He never even considered competing with Mr. Barlow because they were worlds apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, things are different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person now is Roger, no longer the pitiful one from years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not joking," Roger said. "Can't I like Jasper?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's face became increasingly unpleasant, while everyone's gaze kept shifting between William, Roger, and Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The childhood friends and the rumored couple from the school forum were facing off, and it looked like a love triangle!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the scene, there was silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger turned his head and looked at Jasper again. "Jasper, how about dating me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper blinked and her mind went blank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she had been confessed to by boys before, this situation was different because the person in front of her might be Lawrence!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If this person was really Lawrence, then...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper!" Meave, who shared the same dormitory, nudged Jasper with her elbow. "Roger is asking you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper finally snapped out of it and looked around at the people. For a moment, she didn't know how to answer Roger's question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." Jasper hesitated and only managed to say one word before her wrist was suddenly grabbed by another hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, William's voice sounded in her ear. "Let's go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Jasper could react, William had already pulled her out of the compartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This scene stunned everyone again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh my god, what's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why did William take Jasper away?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They have been childhood sweethearts. William is probably helping Jasper out of a difficult situation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Didn't people say that William actually likes Jasper? Of course, he wouldn't want her to agree to date someone else!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if William really likes Jasper, why aren't they dating?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Does Jasper not like William?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Everyone speculated, and some gave sympathetic looks to Roger. After all, the competition was too strong. Not only were they childhood friends, but Jasper was also the heir of the Barlow family, with good looks and a good background.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger didn't show any surprise or anger. He casually picked up a drink, took a sip, smiled, and sat down to continue chatting with others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Roger, are you okay?" a classmate asked him with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm fine, everything's good," he said with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, everything's good! Just now, he clearly saw that William still cared about Jasper just as much as he did ten years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he didn't have any grudges against William, he couldn't let William have his way in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If anyone is to blame, it can only be William's single-minded devotion to Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone had to pay the price for what happened back then, and he and his parents had already paid the price. Now, it was Jasper's turn to pay the price.</p></div>
