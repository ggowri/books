        <h1>Chapter 3071</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Camille felt extremely guilty and her palms started sweating. She tried her best to remain calm and said, "Just like you said earlier, she might have been injured, which is why she couldn't come back. So, I was thinking that her injury might be quite serious, which is why she hasn't been able to return yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No matter what she looks like, she will always be my wife, as long as she is alive and can come back to me..." With this in mind, he will do his utmost to take care of her, protect her, and prevent her from any danger or harm in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's good." Camille breathed a sigh of relief. As long as Brian didn't mind Valda's leg disability, her insecurity would eventually disappear and she could be with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, the restaurant staff brought out the dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille was eating, but Brian didn't touch the dishes in front of him much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should eat some too," Camille said. Every time they met, it seemed like she was the only one eating, while he hardly ate anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't have much of an appetite," Brian said flatly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if you don't have much of an appetite, you should eat a little. You seem to have lost some weight again. If you lose any more, you'll disappear. Let me tell you, Valda likes to paint beautiful women and she used to love painting you the way you were before. If she sees you like this now, she might not even want to paint you anymore," Camille said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyelashes trembled slightly. "You're right."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So he picked up his fork and started eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille knew that sometimes, she had to bring up Valda to get Brian to listen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During the meal, Camille talked about the past experiences she had with Valda, and Brian listened attentively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they finished eating, Camille said to Brian, "Um...can I take a picture of you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" Brian asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille said, "I was thinking that when Valda comes back, I'll show her. It would be such a shame if she wanted to know about you during this time and there wasn't even a photo."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian responded nonchalantly, "Sure, go ahead and take the picture." However, he knew that he was currently too skinny. He wondered if Valda would still find him attractive in this state.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille took a photo of Brian with her phone and then sent it to Valda while he wasn't paying attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Valda plans to see Brian later, can she take a look at the photos now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After two hours, Mo and the other person left the private room and walked towards the restaurant. At that moment, a woman holding a drink hurriedly walked towards them. Suddenly, it seemed like she stumbled and fell towards Brian, spilling her drink in the process.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian quickly dodged to the side, catching the woman off guard. She didn't expect him to dodge, and ended up missing him completely. She stumbled a few steps before regaining her balance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah, yes... I'm sorry..." the woman said awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille, who was standing aside, rolled her eyes when she saw this. This is an old trick from many years ago, and she couldn't believe that someone still enjoys performing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment, Brian didn't pay attention to the other person. He just looked at the torn cloth wrapped around his right wrist. Although he had avoided the woman's drink, some of it had splashed onto the cloth.</p></div>
