        <h1>Chapter 2261</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened to you?" asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman forced a smile. "Neal beat me. He blamed me for being useless because I couldn&rsquo;t help him get a business deal with Weiss Group, so he beat me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was silent. After all, Jacqueline Bowman had come to her before, hoping to help Neal Reid strike a business deal with Martin Weiss. However, she refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman looked at the state Kyla was in and pretended to be generous as she said, "Kyla, don't take it to heart. It has nothing to do with you. I just loved the wrong person. I didn't expect him to hit me just because he failed to get a business deal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman paused again and said apologetically, "I said some mean things when I left the last time. Don't take those words to heart. I was just in a bad mood! And I'm glad I didn't help that animal get the business deal. It's not worth it at all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated and said, "You can leave him and live a good life on your own. Take me, for instance. I ran a small noodle shop and set up a food stall when I got out of prison. I'm happy with running a store like this now. At least I have a peaceful life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman said, "Yes, I think so too. I&rsquo;ve also moved out of Neal Reid's house and am renting a house to stay in while I think about my future. Kyla, I don't have many friends. I'll visit you more often, so please don't find me annoying."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla pressed her lips together but nodded at Jacqueline Bowman's pitiful and expectant eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had helped her in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman instantly smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the next few days, Jacqueline Bowman would visit Kyla and talk to Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yan Qiongyin said, "By the way, Kyla, I want to go to the temple in a couple of days to pray. Why don't you go with me? Besides, you're pregnant now. You can pray for the deity to bless you with a smooth and safe delivery. I heard the deity of that temple has many worshippers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I don't believe in these things," said Kyla. She trusted the doctors in the hospital more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's better to believe in them. Besides, praying won't cause you any harm! I'll drive straight to the parking lot in front of the temple. You won't have to walk much, so you won't get tired." Jacqueline Bowman continued persuading her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn also added, "Just go and pray. There's no harm in seeking peace of mind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elderly like Mrs. Corbyn believed in gods.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stopped rejecting and agreed to go to the temple with Jacqueline Bowman to pray.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's settled, then. I'll pick you up in a couple of days!" said Jacqueline Bowman. Then, she left the store and went back to her car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her face darkened as soon as she got in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had cooked up a plot. Since Kyla had brought her so much misery, she would make Kyla more miserable than her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two days later, Jacqueline Bowman drove Kyla to the temple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On their way there, Jacqueline Bowman casually talked about some topics and then said, "You're three months pregnant now, aren't you? You have to be careful. You can easily miscarry at this stage.&rdquo;</p></div>
