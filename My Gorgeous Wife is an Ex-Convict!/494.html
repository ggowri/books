        <h1>Chapter 493</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taylor Carline nodded cowardly. &ldquo;Y-ye-yes... Lina seduced me!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina wanted to give a slap to that man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was worried that her friend&rsquo;s rash behavior would land her in hot soup, thus she pulled her friend back and said to the couple, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need to be legally responsible for whatever you&rsquo;ve said just now. Otherwise, that&rsquo;s considered as defaming a person&rsquo;s reputation. Why don&rsquo;t we go back into the station to see if we need to open up a case.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taylor Carline shuddered and shut his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hattie Robson was still hurling verbal abuse when Jason lazily looked at her. &ldquo;What a pompous woman. Are you fit to point out what kind of person my girlfriend is? Who do you think you are?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hattie Robson looked horrified. Jason&rsquo;s words were like a slap to her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I... I&rsquo;m just giving a kind reminder. I&rsquo;m worried that you&rsquo;ll be cheated on.&rdquo; Hattie Robson tried to argue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason was not interested to listen to what she had to say. He turned to Lina and said, &ldquo;You were arrested by the police because of such people? Looks like Hadwin doesn&rsquo;t know about it. If he did, these people would not be standing in front of you now.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Jason softly spoke to Grace before leading her down the stairs. A black Bentley was parked on the road at the bottom of the stairs. The trio got in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hattie Robson and Taylor Carline were left standing there like insignificant air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hattie Robson&rsquo;s angry look turned into a look of disbelief when she saw the Bentley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;This car... is not cheap. If it's the top of its series, then the price is not something a regular person can even imagine. Who is this friend of Lina?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;And that man. The last look he gave was so cold. When I think back about it now, it gives me the creeps.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the car, Grace asked Lina to tell the full story.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said, &ldquo;Hattie Robson and Taylor Carline are my colleagues. I&rsquo;m in the same team as Taylor Carline for a project, and he has been trying to flirt with me. I&rsquo;ve been rejecting him but he refused to give up. That's why I called him to the fire stairway to warn him to stop harassing me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said that she assumed that things would end after she had given her warning, but he tried to pull her and make advances on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was when Hattie Robson appeared and blamed Lina for seducing her boyfriend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nobody in the company knew that these two were having an office romance!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The situation became a mess and they ended up in the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was speechless for a moment after she heard the whole story. How could Hattie Robson not blame her boyfriend? Instead, that woman was adamant that it was Lina&rsquo;s fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you together with Hadwin? Why didn&rsquo;t you look for him to bail you out?&rdquo; Jason&rsquo;s voice suddenly resounded within the car.</p></div>
