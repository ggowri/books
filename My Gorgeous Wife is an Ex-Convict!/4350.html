        <h1>Chapter 4348 No Regrets</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's expression turned cold.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So why are you calling off the engagement now? It's not like you just found out that I don't love you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley let out a self-deprecating laugh, "Because I don't want to wait anymore. I'm tired of the feeling of striving hard but getting no response."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before, Harley always thought that as long as he tried hard to love Lornell, one day, Lornell would also fall in love with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But gradually, Harley finally understood that feelings of liking and love don't necessarily reward you for your efforts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, all I need to do is respond to you, right?" Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Harley was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"As long as I make you feel acknowledged, that should be enough, right? Then we wouldn't have to call off the engagement, would we?" Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley didn't understand: "What do you mean by 'feeling like I've received a response'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just like when you say you love me, I can say I love you too. When you smile at me, I can smile back at you. When you show concern for me, I can tell you how much I care about you too," Lornell said, slowly standing up and walking over to Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley stared blankly at Lornell, only to see his handsome thin lips moving, saying, "Harley, I love you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's heart was pounding fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell was saying the words Harley had always longed to hear. Yet, Lornell's gaze didn't hold the affection Harley yearned for. Instead, it was filled with a subtle sense of detachment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Say that again." It took Harley a good while before he managed to utter these words, his voice trembling.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can say it over and over again, Harley, I love you," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Harley's heart was sinking lower and lower.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But you don't love me, do you?" Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But if you want to hear it, I can tell you, I can respond to you. Is it really important whether I love you or not?" Lornell retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, was this what Lornell called a "response"? It was just another name for a lie, allowing Harley to delude herself into thinking that Lornell loved her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this kind of "love" was like a mirage in the water, shattering at the slightest touch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, would you risk your life to save me when I'm in danger?" Harley asked, "Would you face all the criticism around you for my sake? Would you believe in me no matter what happens? Even if many people doubt, would you still firmly stand by my side?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell </span><span>frowned,</span><span> his thin lips pressed tightly together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley gave a light smile, "You can't do it, can you? You can't give me the 'response' I'm looking for, because it's not just about words, but also about actions. Lornell, your so-called response to me is far from enough! So, let's just call off our engagement."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's face darkened, "Do you know the price the Hart family would have to pay to break off this engagement?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mm, I know a bit," she said. "The Hart family is also willing to pay this price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was the apple of her parents' eyes. They would do anything to ensure her happiness. She didn't want to let them down. If she continued with this arranged marriage, she feared she might never find true happiness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You won't regret this?" Lornell asked in a deep voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No regrets." Harley heard his own voice saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then, since you say you regret it, I won't have any regrets either." Lornell said, looking at Harley with an indifferent expression, "Our engagement is off!"</span></p></div>
