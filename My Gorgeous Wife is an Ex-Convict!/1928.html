        <h1>Chapter 1926</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was because she knew how hard it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mason's past was different from that of ordinary children. Secretary Wang's method of education was to completely destroy a child's innocence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately, Mason met Veronica Barlow. The little girl had given Mason warmth and something to hold on to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Apart from Veronica Barlow it was difficult for Mason to open his heart up to others. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Mason was worried about her and Jay after seeing the news. Did that mean that they were slowly starting to have a place in Mason's heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Maybe Mason would accept them one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace walked up to Mason and crouched down with her eyes looking straight into the little one&rsquo;s eyes. "I'm happy that you came to see us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Confusion flickered in the little one's eyes as if he was wondering why the one he should call Mommy was happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Wasn't she hurt? Shouldn't she be sad?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He slightly raised his hands toward Grace's neck. Veronica Barlow wanted to stop him, but it was too late.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His small hands grasped Grace's neck. As there was still gauze around her neck, his grasp touched her wound. Her brows began to frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason saw this and roared, "Mason, let go!" He knew his son had hurt Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one seemed to be startled by Jason's shouts, and his little body suddenly tensed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace hurriedly soothed the little one and whispered, "Jay, Mason is just concerned about my injury."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that, she gently took Mason's hand again and kept his fingers off the gauze around her neck but gently laid it flat on her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said with a smile, "See, it doesn't hurt this way. Mason, my injury will heal soon. As long as I don't touch the wound, it won't hurt much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one's dark eyes stared at Grace. "It won't hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, it won't hurt," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, she saw a faint smile on the little one's lips, making his indifferent face appear friendly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason looked at Mason and somehow got lost in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Half an hour later, Jason ordered his staff to escort Veronica Barlow and Mason safely back to the He family&rsquo;s house. Finally, the ward was quiet again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace asked Jason, "What were you thinking when you were looking at Mason just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason pressed his lips together gently, surprised that she even noticed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at Jason's hesitant face, Grace said, "Jay, we're husband and wife. You can tell me anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason then slowly said, "Mason... looks more and more like that woman now, except for his eyes..."</p></div>
