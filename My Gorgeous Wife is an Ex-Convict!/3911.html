        <h1>Chapter 3909</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Pearl was five years old, the Reed family held a grand birthday party for the little princess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During these five years, Veronica and Mason had a happy marriage, which proved wrong those who thought they were only marrying for money and waiting to see Cinderella's tragic fate in a wealthy family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead, they saw a happy couple, and those who were waiting for a joke were proven wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica started working in the Reed family's business after completing her studies, while Mason continued his education and pursued law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He also made it clear to his family that he wanted to enter the legal profession like his mother in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, Mason's announcement also meant that the burden of the Reed family's business would likely fall on Mick's shoulders in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Jasper had no interest in business, and the younger Jasmine even expressed her desire to become a teacher because she felt that teaching others was a very fulfilling thing to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, Mick could only take up the heavy burden of inheriting the family business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he felt that his personality and talents might be more suitable for becoming a researcher, he did not reject the idea of inheriting the Reed family's business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at the bustling crowd at the birthday banquet, Mick turned to his sister and said, "Soon, the three-year period you and Dad agreed upon will be up. Have you really decided to marry William?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course," Jasper replied without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even you are getting married," Mick sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, among the three of us triplets, you're the only one who hasn't gotten married yet. Don't you want to find someone to love?" Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From childhood to adulthood, my older brother has never had a girlfriend, not even a girl he's been in a flirtatious stage with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It made our family think for a while that my brother might have a problem with his sexual orientation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You and Mason can find a partner, and as for me, even if I remain single for the rest of my life, the Reed family will still have your children to inherit," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But don't you think it would be a regret if you never fall in love with someone in your life, big brother?" Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A regret?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's eyelashes flickered slightly, and he didn't think it was a big regret to never fall in love with someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, everyone is a unique individual, just like how a fish cannot know the joy of a human.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if falling in love with someone is a good thing in your eyes, in my opinion, it's a probability that the person you love also loves you back. If the person I love doesn't love me back, do you want me to beg and plead for their love?" Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper shuddered. Okay, she couldn't imagine the scene of her big brother begging and pleading for a woman, but...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I think if my big brother truly loves someone, it shouldn't be difficult for that person to fall in love with him too," Jasper muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" Mick smiled. "If I have to use methods to calculate and deliberately please someone to make them fall in love with me, don't you think that kind of love would be troublesome?" Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When William came to find Jasper, Mick went to a quieter place at the banquet to have some peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, there were many people who wanted to talk to him here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But suddenly, a crisp slap accompanied by a voice reached his ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, didn't I tell you not to show up here today? Are you planning to bring shame to our entire family?"</p></div>
