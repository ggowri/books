        <h1>Chapter 768</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stella, you're unlike other women, after all. You saved my life before," Brian told Stella Lindsay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Huh?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay stared blankly at him, wondering why he was mentioning this out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Therefore, I'll try my best to meet your requirements. You want to live a luxurious life, to be able to hold your head up in front of others, and you even said that you want to enter show business and be a popular celebrity. I can give you these!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay's eyes lit up immediately, and her expression became excited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian saw the way the person in front of him looked, he felt a sudden disappointment that even he could not describe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this the woman I've been thinking of all my life?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, you're so nice to me!" Stella Lindsay's face turned even redder&hellip; because she was excited that the future she had imagined was coming true little by little. She would join the top brass! She would let those who had looked down on her kneel at her feet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what Brian said next shattered all her fanciful thoughts, turning her face from red to pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What he said was... "However, that's it. You're only my savior, nothing else!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay immediately felt as if a basin of cold water was poured all over her head. It was as if he was warning her not to dream about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes stared blankly at the pair of charming phoenix eyes in front of her, but there was nothing but calmness and indifference in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, her heart went cool. 'This is Brian, the crown prince of the entertainment industry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I hadn't impersonated Grace for saving his life when he was little, this man wouldn't even look at me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Not to mention talking face to face with me like this!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had all these thanks to Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian continued, "Alright, I'll send you back first before going back to Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay followed Brian into the car, clutching her skirt with both hands while suppressing her disappointment, anger, and jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'So what... if I only have all this because of Grace? I won't back down that easily!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It wasn&rsquo;t easy to get to where I am today. I'll definitely make good use of this life-saving grace to marry into a rich and powerful family!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car drove back to Emerald City, and in the car, Jason was silent all the way. However, he had been stroking Grace's wrist, which Brian had held tightly when she walked away from him after having fallen off the cliff. This wrist was also the one Brian had grabbed tightly when she fell off the cliff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hence, the red mark on her wrist was still there. She was fair, so the red mark was all the more obvious against her skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers stroked the red mark on her wrist again and again, and she felt that the skin on the red mark was getting hotter and hotter with a slight prickling sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it hurt?" Finally, he opened his thin lips and broke the silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A little," she said as she bit her lip slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He took her hand and put his lips on the red mark before sticking out the tip of his tongue and licking it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's body immediately stiffened as she blushed deeply. 'What&hellip; What is he doing?'</p></div>
