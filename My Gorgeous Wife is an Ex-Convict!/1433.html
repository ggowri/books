        <h1>Chapter 1432</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was all because... he loved her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He loved her so deeply and so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kyla, I love you!" At that moment, he finally said the words he had been suppressing at the bottom of his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn suddenly stopped struggling. She became quiet and motionless like a compliant doll in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could not help holding her a little tighter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was just like how he had held her in his arms in the past. "I love you. I&rsquo;ve always loved you. I just never dared to admit it. Do you know how worried I was when you stabbed the broken shard of glass into your stomach? I even wished I had been the one who was hurt instead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I should have known just how much I love her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kyla, I was blinded by hatred in the past, but not anymore. I'll give my all to treat you right. I'll clear your name and let you live the life you want. I'll give you my liver if you want it. If the first time isn't enough, then I&rsquo;ll give it to you a second time and a third time... until you get well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would give his life to save her! He would pay any price as long as he could save her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was stunned when she realized that he had found out about her illness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'His liver? I... had once hoped he would want to save me, but then I learned that I should never pin my hopes on this man!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't love you." A cold and indifferent voice gently drifted out of Martin Weiss's arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His body stiffened in an instant. It was as if even his heart had stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin Weiss, I don't love you. I really don't love you anymore." Kyla Corbyn raised her hands, pushed him away, and took two steps back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her eyes looked at the man in front of her indifferently. She was eerily calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"After all, you could sacrifice your so-called love for revenge. And now you desperately want to make it up to me, and you admit that you love me again because you&rsquo;ve found out I was the one who saved your life. What good is a love like yours? It's just something you mess around with."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His face instantly turned pale. "No... It's not... It's not what you think. It's not..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn said lightly, "It doesn't matter whether it is. Martin Weiss, I don't care nor want your love! As for the liver donation, you don't have to donate it to me just because I saved you. Maybe it's a good thing for me to die without anything that belongs to you. At least, we would have nothing to do with each other whether I live or die."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In her current condition, even if she did receive his liver, her chances of survival were slim. She would probably die on the operating table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In that case, she should just spend her last few months with her beloved family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He seemed to be tottering. What she said was like an invisible hand that ruthlessly pushed him off a tall cliff and into the depths of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It turns out... I'm beyond redemption!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It turns out she's so disgusted with me that even if she dies, she doesn't want to have anything that belongs to me in her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It turns out the love I've been struggling to recognize is nothing to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What she wants is to have nothing to do with me, whether she's alive or dead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But she's the one I love the most and the one I owe the most!'</p></div>
