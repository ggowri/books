        <h1>Chapter 4077</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Okay," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But even if you have a girlfriend in the future, I will still support you," Tina said with a smile. "Although many people say that if you choose to be an idol star, you shouldn't date, there are also fans who hope that their idols can become happier. Even if it's love, they will give their full blessings!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, no matter what choice you make, you should also think about the consequences of that choice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit looked at the person in front of him in a daze. It's really nice to have such fans as an idol, but why did he feel a sense of regret when Tina said this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"OK, take a shot!" Weldon's voice interrupted Kit's trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then did he snap out of it. He had been staring at her, lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The makeup artist came over to touch up Tina and Kit's makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the touch-up, Weldon said to them, "The next shoot should have a hormone-filled feeling. Same outfits, but different emotions. There should be tension between the man and the woman, a mix of strength and softness! You can have some physical contact, and for the first part, you can improvise. For the second part, I'll design some shooting actions."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Got it," they replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the shoot resumed, Kit looked at Tina in front of him. How would she express that feminine tension?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If her androgynous feeling from last time had stunned him, would he be stunned again today?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as he was thinking this, Kit's pupils shrank. Tina in front of him, in the same outfit and makeup, had suddenly become completely different from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If before she had given off the feeling of a simple and cheerful girl, now she gave off the feeling of a woman wrapped in sharp knives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sharp and charming, stunningly beautiful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why was this happening?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though her makeup was now more subdued than he remembered from other heavily made-up women, she was even more gorgeous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because of the change in her eyes?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the aura around her was so different from before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then her hand lightly touched his, her fingers interlacing with his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Interlocking fingers... This kind of contact was nothing to him, but at this moment, it gave him goosebumps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Naturally, he followed her movements and his gaze was fixed on her, as if he wanted to see every change in her eyes and expression!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He only snapped out of it when the photographer called a stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tina did great, but Kit, you need to have more tension. In the camera, your presence is completely overshadowed by Tina's," Weldon said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll pay attention," Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Makeup artist, touch up their makeup," Weldon said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The makeup artist came over and touched up Kit and Tina's makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Were you nervous just now?" Tina asked because she felt his hand tremble slightly when she held it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nervous? Kit lowered his eyes. He wasn't a newcomer, and he had experienced this kind of shooting countless times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">How could he be nervous?!</p></div>
