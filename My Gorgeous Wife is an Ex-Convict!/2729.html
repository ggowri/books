        <h1>Chapter 2727</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wei Jayg looked envious. "Valda, what business does your family have? How did you meet Mr. Hart?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "I'm only a comic artist. My family doesn't have any business. I come from a regular family. We met each other when we were eating noodles at a restaurant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These were not a secret anyway. There was no need to hide it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wei Jayg looked surprised. She thought Valda Theller could become Brian's girlfriend because of her family background, but now, it sounded like she was only a regular comic artist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Can such a woman also become Brian's girlfriend? My family runs a small business, but Patrick didn't even introduce me to the others just now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wei Jayg felt a surge of jealousy as she thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, someone suddenly went over. Then, a contemptuous voice rang out. "I was wondering who I saw. It turned out to be you. Who are you to attend such a banquet?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked up and saw Phoebe Cross in an exquisite bespoke gown. She remembered Phoebe Cross from the last party with Brian's friends that she had attended.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was a socialite in Emerald City as well as Brian's childhood friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides that, she could tell that Phoebe Cross liked Brian, but Brian did not reciprocate the feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm here to accompany Brian. If you don't think I deserve to come, tell that to Brian," Valda Theller said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew she was now Brian's girlfriend. Perhaps she could not do much, but at least she could not embarrass him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have a smart mouth." Phoebe Cross sized up the expensive gown and jewelry that Valda Theller wore, and her eyes became more contemptuous. "Brian must have gotten you this outfit. A woman like you is only after Brian's money and trying to get the best you can out of him. I've met so many women like you. Don't spend a penny of Brian's money if you have a backbone!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people around them began to look over, and several socialites close to Phoebe Cross also walked over. After hearing Phoebe Cross's statement, they looked at Valda Theller with disdain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So that's her? There are so many scheming women out there who are obsessed with money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, some women say it isn't for money, but they're actually all about money!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could Brian fall for such a woman? She must have pulled some shady stunt, huh?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every word was an attack. All they needed to do was put a label with the words &lsquo;greedy scheming girl&rsquo; on Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could feel the eyes on her. It was not in her nature to argue, but she felt no desire to escape at that moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, she got up, raised her chin, and said, "What's the matter? Don't you think Brian has any other charms except money? I like Brian because of his personality and sincerity. Miss Song, I thought at least you&rsquo;d know how charming Brian is. It turns out that you think all Brian has is wealth."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she said this, Phoebe Cross and the socialites around her were rendered speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Excuse me," said Valda Theller, turning to find Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross lost her temper when she saw that. She picked up a drink from the waiter's tray and threw it at Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda Theller saw that out of the corners of her eyes and wanted to avoid it, it was already too late. She could only raise her hand to block it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a figure was faster as they held her. Instantly, the drink spilled all over Brian.</p></div>
