        <h1>Chapter 2378</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he would be willing to do anything for her if she cried in front of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla did not expect Martin Weiss to offer to help search for Amber Mitchell! It was not until Martin Weiss called his men and asked them to check the list of patients in mental hospitals across the country in the past ten years that she was sure he was serious about helping her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only condition was that she did not cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla found it unbelievable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter what Martin Weiss was thinking, he was willing to help search for Amber Mitchell. She was grateful for that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She lay in bed, and it was dark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lights in the room were off, and the only source of light was the moonlight streaming in through the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla opened her eyes and looked blankly at the man lying beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His usually cold and solemn face seemed gentle now that he was sleeping. With his tall nose bridge and beautiful lips, the man looked tender.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered how he had wiped her tears with his hands and told her to stop crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, she even fell into a trance and almost thought that he was never hypnotized to begin with. She almost believed that he was still the same Martin Weiss who loved her and would do anything for her as long as she did not cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could I... have such an illusion?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla could not help raising her right hand to reach for Martin Weiss's face, but she instantly stopped right as she was about to touch his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was so close, yet so far.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, thank you. And... I hurt you back then. Maybe you not loving me now is the best outcome for us, so don't love me. That way, we'll have nothing holding us back when we divorce later." That way, he could live well and start a new life without her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, she would put away her feelings in a corner where no one else could touch them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not that they had never loved each other. They just kept letting each other slip away...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled mournfully as a soft sigh escaped her mouth. She withdrew her hand and slowly closed her eyes, not noticing Martin Weiss clenching the blanket slightly as he lay beside her&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the following days, the Reed family and Martin Weiss&rsquo;s men were busy looking through the list of mental hospitals. Lina had also asked Hadwin Stephenson to investigate after learning about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With three parties investigating, they finally found a person named Amber Mitchell in a mental hospital in Deer City. She was admitted eight years ago. All her personal information, from her height to other details, matched the information Kyla provided. However, Kyla was stunned when she saw the photo of &lsquo;Amber Mitchell&rsquo; that they sent over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a woman in a hospital gown. Her hair was patchy and uneven. She was bald in some spots as her scalp seemed to have suffered some injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman's eyes were dark and almost without light. Her skin was so pale it was almost transparent, and there was a scar on her cheek that was like a centipede. It could be considered to be a disfigurement. The most shocking thing was that the woman had no ring finger on her right hand. She was missing a finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stared blankly at the photo, almost unable to believe her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'That's Amber Mitchell! It's Amber Mitchell!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a far cry from the woman she remembered, but she could recognize that it was Amber Mitchell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The once beautiful woman had turned out like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is going on here? How... did Amber Mitchell become like this?'</p></div>
