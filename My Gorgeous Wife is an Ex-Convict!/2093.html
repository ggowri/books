        <h1>Chapter 2091</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss whispered, "I know it's my fault. It's my fault! Kyla, I was so wrong. I know I can't make up for it. I just wish I can treat you well and try my best to do so!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla smiled faintly, even a little nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if someone who used to matter so much to her was nobody now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Since Nelson and I have been surviving well without your care, why do we need you to take care of us now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her words instantly made his blood freeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said, "Martin Weiss, can't you just pretend you never found out about my pregnancy? There are already enough mistakes between us. If we get involved with each other again and again, we&rsquo;ll just end up hurting others as well as ourselves.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He looked at her blankly, feeling that the distance between them seemed to be growing further and further apart even though they were so close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're the heir of the Weiss family and the head of the Weiss family. You can find women who love you. You don't need to continue harassing me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Besides, Martin Weiss, I'm too old now. I'm 35 and no longer a young woman. I can't afford to get hurt at this age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What you're doing now is just because of your obsession. You feel sorry for me, so you want to make it up to me. But I don't need it. I just want to live the rest of my life in peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, will you leave me alone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She spoke softly. It was as if it was the calmness after the storm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It's not an obsession. It's because I love you! I love you no matter how old you are!" He roared with a choked up voice. "Kyla, I won't hurt you. Believe me for once!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she still looked at him with calm and indifferent eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if the distance between them would never close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Martin Weiss, my trust in you was completely destroyed back then. How are you going to make something that has been destroyed reappear again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What she said instantly sent him to hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Kyla got back to the store, Mrs. Corbyn looked at her pale face and asked, "What's the matter? Are you feeling sick again? What happened to going to the hospital for a follow-up? What did the doctor say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The doctor said... it's nothing serious," Kyla said with a forced smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's great." Mrs. Corbyn was relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just as Kyla was ready to go to the room at the back to get changed, a car drove up to the store. Then, someone got out and carried boxes of oranges, sour plums of various brands, and other similar goods to Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mr. Weiss asked us to send these to you, Miss Corbyn," the person said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked blankly at these things. These were what the doctor had told Martin Weiss could relieve nausea. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not expect Martin Weiss to get someone to send them over so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Without waiting for Kyla to answer, the man down the things and left. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn mumbled in confusion, "He&rsquo;s talking about Martin Weiss, isn&rsquo;t he? Why did he send all these here, and he sent so many too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said nothing but looked down at her flat belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace came to the store to see Kyla when she was free and saw Kyla looking distracted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, what's the matter? Is there something on your mind?" asked Grace.</p></div>
