        <h1>Chapter 1429</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'That was why she had smiled at me like that. She smiled and thanked me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Because she had completely let go of her feelings for me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And I was such a fool! Only now have I learned the true meaning of that smile.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When the car stopped, he heard the driver in front of him exclaim, "Mr. Weiss, why... are you bleeding?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss slowly opened his eyes. Following the driver's gaze, he raised his hand to the corner of his lips to touch it and found that the corner of his lips was bleeding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had bitten his lip so hard that he unconsciously injured it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss wiped the blood from his lips, opened the door, and got out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, just as he was about to go to the hospital's inpatient building, he saw Kyla Corbyn, Mrs. Corbyn, and the two men from before who had been in charge of guarding the ward's entrance coming out of the hospital. The two men were holding duffel bags in their hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It looked like they were discharging from the hospital!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss immediately lunged forward. "Have you been discharged from the hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, when he tried to get close to Kyla Corbyn, he was once again stopped by the two men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn did not expect to see Martin Weiss again. She thought she had made herself clear that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So what if I have? Do I have to report to you when I&rsquo;m discharged?" Kyla Corbyn asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But you know that your body..." His voice stopped short, and his lips quivered. His face turned pale, and he seemed afraid to go on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if he was subconsciously hoping that her illness was not real.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"...needs a good rest in the hospital and you should undergo treatment." He managed to finish his sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No thanks. I know my body very well," Kyla Corbyn said lightly, intending to go past Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You know it very well? If you know it very well, you wouldn't be in such a hurry to be discharged from the hospital! Do you really want to die?" Martin Weiss panicked, but the two men were stopping him. He could not get close to Kyla Corbyn at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn stopped in her tracks and looked at Martin Weiss with some surprise. Then, she put on a look of realization and smiled gently. "Mr. Weiss, don't worry. Even if I'm dying, I won't die in front of you and irritate your eyes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss stiffened and felt as if he had been severely slapped in the face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He deeply regretted what he had said back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"So-Sorry..." he said hoarsely while his lips trembled. He did not even know what to say after that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There's only hatred between you and me. The word &lsquo;sorry&rsquo; has no meaning. Please don't show up in front of me again... Don't show up in front of me again until I die!" Kyla Corbyn said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss only felt like he was soaking in ice water at that moment. He was cold to the bone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Has she come to dislike me to this extent? She&rsquo;ll hate me even after she dies? It turns out words can be so painful and upsetting!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How many hurtful things have I said to her before?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Corbyn glared at Martin Weiss with hatred before saying to her daughter, "Let's go! Ignore people like him! Even if I have to beg for food, I won't beg him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Accompanied by the two bodyguards, Kyla Corbyn and Mrs. Corbyn got into the car and left the hospital while Martin Weiss still stood there. He was staring at Kyla Corbyn's back, his face full of pain, remorse, and... helplessness.</p></div>
