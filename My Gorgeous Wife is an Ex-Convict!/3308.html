        <h1>Chapter 3306</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's okay, I won't get into trouble that easily. Don't worry too much," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As her pregnancy progressed, she could feel his nervousness more and more. It was like he was always on edge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you just talking about me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, what else would we talk about?" she replied. After all, he was the only thing they had in common.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you ever want to know about my past, you can just ask me. I'll tell you everything," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can I ask you anything?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anything," he replied. "Valda, I have no secrets from you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In other words, he was willing to be completely open with her. He wouldn't hide anything she wanted to know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt warm inside, thinking about what Taelyn had said to her before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I really envy you for being the wife of the prince. He will marry you because he truly loves you. Although I dated him for three months, I never felt like his girlfriend during that time. He wouldn't even hold my hand or hug me, let alone any other intimate actions. I think his previous girlfriends probably had similar experiences."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, there shouldn't be anything between him and his ex-girlfriend, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was thinking when suddenly a woman's scream came from the bathroom, "Ah, this is the women's bathroom, why is there a man here?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda suddenly remembered that she was in the women's restroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, she clearly felt Brian's body stiffen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the two of them came out of the restroom, Brian's face was already flushed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda rarely saw him blush like this, so she couldn't help but stare at his face in fascination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't look." Brian said awkwardly, it was his first time accidentally entering the women's restroom and he almost got mistaken for a pervert.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I never thought that I would experience such an embarrassing and awkward situation before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems like because of her, he has experienced too many firsts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well... um, I guess this is a special experience in life." She cleared her throat, trying to ease his embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." He was a bit speechless. A special experience? He would rather not have this special experience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And the way you blush is actually quite cute." She continued to comfort him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He remained speechless, unsure if he should praise her for her creative comfort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's like a red apple, makes people want to take a bite." She continued, as if afraid he wouldn't believe her. "Really!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you sure you really want to comfort me?" Brian said, laughing and crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Isn't it comforting?" She said earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, as long as you're okay, even if you're really arrested by the police, I don't care." Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda opened her arms and hugged him, "But I care. Brian, I think I'm falling more and more in love with you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought that her love for him was already a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, it seems like there are even more than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Will there be even more in the future than there is now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's my pleasure, Valda. I'm glad you're falling more in love with me," Brian replied with a gentle tone and a tender gaze that made her feel like she was getting drunk on his affection."</p></div>
