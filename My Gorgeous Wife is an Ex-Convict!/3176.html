        <h1>Chapter 3174</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you love someone, you would never want to see them get hurt. If they do get hurt, you would feel their pain more than your own," she continued, and Brian's face unexpectedly came to her mind. "If you truly loved me, you would have had plenty of time to come find me after we graduated from college all those years ago, but you didn't."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I at that time..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, you don't love me, really," she said. "You only have some feelings for me, but it's not love. And as for me, I only had a crush on you at first, but it wasn't love either. So, between us, there was never a beginning, and there's no possibility of 'what if' scenarios like if we hadn't met before, things would be different now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at her blankly, listening to her say, "Even if you hadn't used me back then, you and I would still only be strangers now, and there wouldn't be any other outcome."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A hint of sadness flickered in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But are there any other outcomes? Her words were so cruel to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, he has been thinking about her, but now she tells him that his feelings for her don't even qualify as love!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So... does he love you?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though no names were mentioned, both of them knew that the "he" referred to in his words was who.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian loves me very much. In this world, no one loves me more than him," said Valda with a happy expression. "Similarly, I love him very much. After falling in love with him, I realized what it truly means to love someone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now that you have a limp, do you really think that the Hart family will treat you the same as before? The Hart family is a wealthy and influential family, can they withstand the scrutiny of others? If you stand by Brian's side, how many people will gossip about you? In the long run, how much of your relationship will remain? Have you thought about these things?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Raymond spoke slowly and deliberately, even he himself couldn't quite discern what his intentions were in saying these words. Was he really just trying to kindly remind Valda?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or is it his own unwillingness?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is Brian the one who won Valda's love, while Raymond couldn't bear to lose her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But before Valda could respond, a cold voice sounded behind Raymond, "Take your hands off, Valda is not someone you can touch!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Raymond stiffened and turned to look behind him, while Valda also looked in the direction of the voice and exclaimed, "Brian!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian walked up to Valda, raised his hand and directly pushed away Raymond's hand holding Valda's wrist. "Raymond, you better not appear in front of me and Valda again. If you dare to ruin our relationship, I will not let you go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian spoke harshly, but Raymond suddenly laughed. "Mr. Hart, what's wrong? Are you afraid that I will ruin your relationship? If I can ruin it, it only proves that your relationship is not that strong, isn't it?"</p></div>
