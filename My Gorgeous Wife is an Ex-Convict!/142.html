        <h1>Chapter 141</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Jason did not even bother to look at Zoe. He just said to Grace, "Sis, what do you think? Is it enough?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this point, no matter how much she resented Grace, Zoe could only beg her for mercy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, I... I know I was wrong. I shouldn't have treated your friend like that. I... I can apologize to your friend. Please, spare me."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace looked at Zoe, who was crying bitterly at this moment. She knew very well that she was begging for mercy because of Jason, not because of her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Seeing the state that Zoe was in, she didn't have any sympathy for her at all. When she thought about how Lina had been treated like this, she hated her even more, and she blamed herself as well.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She would rather accept the humiliation herself instead of making Lina suffer.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lina had already sacrificed so much for her. Ever since Grace was released from prison, she hadn't been able to make it up to Lina even though she had suffered such hardships because of her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Then, I want you to apologize to Lina in front of everyone who witnessed the scene that day. You will also be responsible for paying the medical bills, work compensation, and so on," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe nodded and agreed without hesitation. Apologies and compensations were such a small price to pay for not breaking her hand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence removed his foot. Zoe held the hand that had been stepped on, and she was in so much pain that she couldn't even hold her walking stick.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason then ordered Terrence, "Tell Sean to come in and take his sister away."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes," Terrence answered and retrieved Sean from outside the ward.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as Sean saw his sister holding her hand with tears on her face, he quickly helped her up. Then he cast a complicated look at Jason and Grace who were sitting on the sofa.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although he had already known that they were together, it was the first time he had seen them face to face.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The woman who he had abandoned and had been dropped to the bottom of the city was now on a meteoric rise. Maybe in the future, he would have to look up to her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This kind of change in identity made him feel a kind of unspeakable anxiety.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed, then... I'll take my sister away now," Sean said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly and said, "Don't you want to say hello to Grace? You should be old acquaintances."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The tone he spoke this sentence with was very plain, but it made Sean feel an inexplicable fear.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This... this... Miss Cummins and I haven't seen each other for a long time. I hope we can let bygones be bygones," he replied carefully. He could feel a cold sweat on his back gradually breaking out.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Jason's next sentence made Sean shudder in fear.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, when you had your accident, he immediately broke up with you. If you want to take your revenge, you can tell me and I will help you." Jason's words sounded like carrying out what he had just said would take close to no effort.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, when the Stevens siblings heard this, their faces changed in unison.</p></div>
