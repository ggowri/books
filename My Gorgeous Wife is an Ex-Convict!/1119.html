        <h1>Chapter 1118</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She rolled her eyes at him. "What do you think? You'll know if you get bitten."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Sure. If you really want to bite me, do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina widened her eyes. 'No way. He's letting me bite him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if she really had to bite him, it seemed... she could not do it! Lina looked at the face in front of her that one could almost call beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His looks had always been more neutral but not feminine. His fine features became clearer when she looked at him at such a close distance. She could even count his slightly fluttering eyelashes. He was... so seductive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina could not help but pounce on him, kissing and licking him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was reluctant to bite him, so this was the only way to go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson trembled. His thin lips parted slightly and his hoarse voice said, "You're not biting?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're so beautiful, I can't bear to do it!" said Lina as she was almost on top of him, kissing him non-stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina..." he muttered, his voice more hoarse than ever. "If... If you want to go home tonight, stop."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I don't want to," she said, putting her arms around his neck, not wanting to separate from him tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to be with him. She wanted to hold him tightly. She wanted to tell herself that she should cherish her luck of being able to be with the one she loved!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes darkened. He suddenly bent down, picked her up, and headed for the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they went into the bedroom, she suddenly said as he put her on the bed, "Wait. Well... Contraception&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish her words, he leaned forward and kissed her on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was almost drunk in his kiss. She finally managed to get back to her senses. "Wait... If... If you... If you don't... Don't use contraception, I... I might get pregnant..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stammered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So be it!" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes widened instantly as she looked at him in disbelief. 'Wasn't he scared that I&rsquo;d get pregnant and the Stephenson family would harm me? Why is he willing to let me get pregnant now?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers caressed her rosy lips. "Since the Stephenson family has made you a target, I need to hasten my plans. I'll solve the Stephenson family's issue within three months, so&hellip; three months later, we'll get married whether you're pregnant or not!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson spoke. Marriage was the most proper respect he could give this woman! Even though he did not find the papers very binding, it was important to other people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loved her and just wanted to be with her all his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get... Get married?" Lina only felt that she had received one shocking news after another, and she was almost blown dizzy by the bombshells he threw her way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, we&rsquo;ll get married. I love you, and you love me too. Isn't it the most natural thing for us to get married?" said Hadwin Stephenson. He did not want to drag her into the Stephenson family's conflict. He wanted to talk to her about getting married after he solved the Stephenson family's internal conflict.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now that the first wife and her family had taken this step, he did not need to delay it any longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He should speed up and knock them over so they could no longer have any funny ideas.</p></div>
