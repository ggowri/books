        <h1>Chapter 3225</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda used to dislike being followed around all the time, but after what happened today, she finally realized that it was necessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Brian's identity alone is enough to make many people greedy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once greed takes hold of the human heart, many things will be done recklessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However... "Wait, so, sometimes when there's nobody around on the roadside, we... kiss. Your bodyguards have seen us do that too?" Valda suddenly thought of this question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's expression became somewhat unnatural, and he vaguely said, "Maybe."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I guess so," Valda muttered to herself, blushing again, and then began to look around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you watching?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Looking at your bodyguards, they are there now," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you see them, I can immediately dismiss them," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"... " She was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Valda returned to the hotel, she received another call from Camille who asked, "I heard you encountered kidnappers, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda paused for a moment, then quickly realized something and said, "Don't tell me I'm trending again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, congratulations on making it to the trending list again," said Camille. "But first, tell me, is it a big deal or not?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can answer your call now, which means everything is fine," Valda said. "The kidnappers acted on a whim, but they didn't even touch me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's good," said Camille. "Someone captured a video on site. Although it's not complete, it's quite exciting. The van was forced to stop by several cars, just like in a police action movie. How many people did Brian send to protect you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Uh..." Valda paused, she realized that she had never asked this question before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But as long as you're okay, that's good. Are you coming back tomorrow?" Camille asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mmm, I'll come back tomorrow," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, when you come back, let's make time to get together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After ending the call, Valda opened her phone's web browser and checked it out. As expected, it was trending on the hot search.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And when she clicked on it, she saw the video that Camille had mentioned. In the video, the two young men who had rushed over were already pinned to the ground by the bodyguards. Shortly after, the van was forced to stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The following scene shows Brian rushing towards her, pulling her nervously and checking if she's injured. Then, he embraces her tightly and holds her in his arms.</p></div>
