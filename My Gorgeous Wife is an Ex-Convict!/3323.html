        <h1>Chapter 3321</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence disappeared without a trace, and neither the Reed family nor the police were able to locate him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was thanks to the Reed family's intervention that those loan shark organizations were exposed, and the murderer of the Abbott couple was also brought to light.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the days went by, Grace's heart sank deeper and deeper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The longer the time drags on, the smaller the chance of Lawrence's survival.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One month later, the police issued a notice and formally arrested the suspect for the crime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the announcement, the names of the Abbott couple were only mentioned as "the Abbott couple" along with their missing son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, anyone familiar with the Abbott family can easily recognize which family it is!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Jasper finally found out about this matter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Jasper stood in front of Grace with teary eyes, Grace sighed in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With the advancement of technology, she naturally didn't think that she could keep this a secret from her daughter for a lifetime. Originally, she only planned to tell Jasper about it after finding Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, unexpectedly, Lawrence did not find what he was looking for. Instead, he went missing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mummy!" Jasper choked up and said, "The news was talking about Lawrence's family, wasn't it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it's the Abbott family," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about Lawrence? The news said that Lawrence has gone missing and his whereabouts are unknown. Is it true that he cannot be found?" Jasper said, tears falling down his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She is angry with Lawrence for wanting to use her, but she never imagined that Lawrence had gone through something so terrible and even disappeared!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mummy, can you send someone to find Lawrence for me? Please help me find him, I... I'm not angry with him anymore!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In fact, when we first found out that Lawrence had gone missing, Mom and Dad had already sent people to look for him, but they just couldn't find him," Grace said, feeling reluctant to see her daughter's disappointed expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper heard this and cried even harder, "So... does that mean I will never see Lawrence again?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the future, anything is possible. Maybe we'll be able to find Lawrence soon," Grace said. "My parents will continue to send people to search for Lawrence, and the police will also continue to search. With so many people looking, we'll eventually find him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace knows deep down that this is just a beautiful hope, and the possibility of it happening is actually very small.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, in any case, she has to give her daughter this hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper sniffled and his tears finally subsided a bit. "Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really, Mommy believes that we can definitely find Lawrence!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, we will definitely find him!" Jasper nodded heavily. "When we find Lawrence, I...I want to tell him that I want to be friends with him again! And since his parents are no longer around, how about we bring him to our home to live? I will go to school with him and we can play the piano together..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she was very angry with him before, now she just wants him to be safe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, when we find Lawrence, Mommy and Daddy will bring him to our home to live with us," promised Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, after my daughter cried herself to sleep, Grace found it hard to fall asleep herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The door to the room was pushed open and Jason walked in.</p></div>
