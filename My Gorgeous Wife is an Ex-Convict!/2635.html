        <h1>Chapter 2633</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's almost lunchtime now. Let's eat first," Brian said after looking at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me treat you. You've been modeling for so long today that we almost missed lunch," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're treating me?" His eyes glimmered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course. I can't afford anything too expensive though." She added after touching her nose. After all, the restaurant he brought her to before was out of the question as it cost tens of thousands of dollars for a meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anything will do. I'm not a fussy eater," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was relieved. The two walked out of the studio. Valda Theller asked as they walked, "What would you like to eat? Chinese food or Japanese food? Korean food or Thai food?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anything works," he said, glancing suddenly at a nearby small restaurant. Her studio was close to the small restaurant where they met for the second time. "Do you often eat at that small restaurant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's have lunch there, then," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There?" Valda Theller froze. After all, the donburi in the restaurant only cost 10 to 20 dollars each. It seemed a little shabby if she treated him that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong?" he asked her as she looked stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you think it's too cheap?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The price doesn't matter. Didn't we eat in that restaurant last time?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two walked into the restaurant and ordered their meal separately. Valda Theller said, "By the way, why did you dine in this small restaurant the last time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I happened to pass by and got a little nostalgic, so I came in," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nostalgic?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This restaurant used to be a small noodle shop. I had a friend who worked here, so I used to dine here too," murmured Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had recognized Grace back then, he would not have made the mistake he regretted for the rest of his life afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must be very close with that friend of yours," Valda Theller speculated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian only answered her with silence. He gently lowered his eyes as if to suppress the overwhelming emotions in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller suddenly had a feeling that the person mentioned must be important to him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were so important that he would enter the small noodle shop where his friend no longer worked in even though a long time had passed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the small restaurant was noisy as there were many people talking, Valda Theller felt that their table was isolated and quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Soon, the donburi they ordered arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to Brian's elegant table manners, Valda Theller seemed to be wolfing down her food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, her phone rang. She looked at the caller ID and found that it was Camille Strickland. "Camille, what's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Great news! Didn't I tell you that your comic &lsquo;Meeting You&rsquo; is getting adapted into a film?" Camille Strickland said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. What's the matter?" Valda Theller asked in confusion. A film company picked up on the comic Meeting You due to its good sales and decided to adapt it into a film. However, she was not a well-known comic artist, after all. Therefore, it would only be a low-budget online series even if it was adapted.</p></div>
