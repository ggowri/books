        <h1>Chapter 2437</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">the Moss family's eldest heir, Herman Moss, used to be his best friend, but he also made him the unlucky one who was betrayed by his best friend and fianc&eacute;e!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He also fell out with Herman Moss because of Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would never forget what Herman Moss had said at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George, you don't know Amber Mitchell at all. If you did, you wouldn't be saying things like that to me today!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you the only one who knows her? Yeah, you know her so well that you got into her bed, didn't you? How was it? Is she good? Otherwise, she wouldn't have made you, the Moss family's eldest heir, so obsessed with her. It's a pity Amber Mitchell is nothing more than a woman I've fooled around with!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he said this, Herman Moss punched him. George Gregory was reluctant to be seen as weak, so the two men started a fight right away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two ended up with bruises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Herman Moss finally left, he only said, "George Gregory, you're blind. It's a pity that I ever envied you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had not been able to figure out what it meant, and there was no way Herman Moss could give him an answer now since he was dead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's eyes darkened at the thought of it. "Are you saying that someone deliberately approached a member of the Moss family for Amber Mitchell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah... Yeah..." Louise Mitchell said as George Gregory's eyes made her uneasy for some reason. "I just thought they wanted to get gossip. I didn't expect her to be taken away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Find her! We can find her as long as they're still in Deer City!" George Gregory said coldly. He walked out of the room and headed for the study. Louise Mitchell quickly followed him only to hear George Gregory telling his subordinates on the phone looking for Amber Mitchell. He used all the connections the Gregory family had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's heart sank as jealousy flickered in her eyes. George was using so many resources to find Amber Mitchell, even using the connections of the elders. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only Amber Mitchell... Was it worth it to spend so much effort to look for a woman who had once betrayed him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is George Gregory really over Amber Mitchell? Or has he always been concerned about her? It's just that he has been hiding his concern all this while?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sent Amber Mitchell to the hospital and met up with the doctor that Philip Barlow had contacted. Then, she stayed outside the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor said the evaluation would take at least three hours, but it was only a preliminary diagnosis, of course.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as long as the preliminary diagnosis could show that Amber Mitchell was not a mental patient, there was enough reason to question whether the Mitchell family was fit to be Amber Mitchell's guardian even if they found them. Moreover, there would also be grounds to question the previous diagnosis. Therefore, before coming up with the final diagnosis, they must protect and free Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mick Reed had fallen asleep in Grace's arms. Grace looked at the son in her arms with a proud look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her son had been a great help tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he was young, he could not be underestimated.</p></div>
