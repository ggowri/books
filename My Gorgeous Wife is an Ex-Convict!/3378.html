        <h1>Chapter 3376</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do you want to hang out with me? Don't forget, we've had a fight before," he stared at her and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you're good, you didn't say anything about my mommy, and you even made those few people apologize!" said Harley. "But why won't you tell me your name?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why do I have to tell you my name again?" Lornell asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems that Harley was asked this question. She blinked her eyes and tilted her head, thinking for a moment before finally saying, "Do I have to wait until we become good friends before you can tell me your name?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Good friend?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell looked at the other person with a dumbfounded expression, how could he possibly become friends with this kid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley said, "Let's go play!" before waiting for him to let go of the other person. He then grabbed Lornell's hand and headed towards the slide.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, the security guards standing by the railing outside the amusement park were staring in amazement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bodyguard from the Hart family became wary as Harley approached Lornell. Although he had never met Lornell before, his instincts told him that this child was not ordinary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Harley grabbed the other person's hand, the bodyguard's anxiety level skyrocketed. After all, he was responsible for the safety of his young master. If anything were to happen to the young lady while she was here, Mr. Hart would surely punish him severely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he was completely focused on watching his young miss and the little boy, he suddenly heard someone whispering next to him, "No way, that child is actually holding onto the young master's hand!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That child has too much courage!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The young master didn't even shake him off. Does the young master know that child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The bodyguard of the Hart family turned his head towards the person next to him upon hearing this. The other person also looked at him alertly, and so the several bodyguards looked at each other in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, the bodyguard from the Hart family broke the silence and asked, "Is this young boy in the blue shirt your...young master?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person seemed to have realized something and asked, "Is the one wearing the pink dress your family member?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's my young lady," said the Hart family's bodyguard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So the few people looked at each other again, fell into silence, and then looked back at their respective masters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Harley has brought Lornell to the slide. She takes the initiative to hold his hand and places it around her waist. Then, she earnestly says, "You need to hold onto me so we can slide down together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell frowned, but Harley pulled him down and they slid all the way down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the two of them rushed down the slide and landed in the pile of ocean balls below, Lornell was a bit slow to react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He's actually playing on the slide with this kid?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If those people found out, they would definitely laugh at him mercilessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, his gaze suddenly swept towards the few bodyguards outside the field.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The few bodyguards were taken aback. The young master's gaze, is this... a warning?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately, several bodyguards understood the situation and knew that this matter had to be kept secret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, suddenly a burst of giggling laughter erupted.</p></div>
