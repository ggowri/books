        <h1>Chapter 403</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, what he said next covertly confirmed her speculations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How about this? We're not looking for trouble. Give us back the money for the 20 sets of fast food, plus 5,000 dollars in damages. After all, some of us have already started eating the food you delivered. Who knows if there are bugs in the rest of those lunchboxes?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the man finished speaking, several others got up and surrounded Grace. They were trying to give Grace some pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked around. They were at a semi-open space that was being rented for the shoot. There was a surveillance camera on the front left from where they were at right now, but she had no idea if it was turned on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Further ahead, a few fans were blocked off by a gate and squatting. Some were resting while the others were holding their phones up to see if they could catch a glimpse of their idols.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, it's not up to a delivery girl like me to decide. Let me talk to my boss about the situation," said Grace as she fumbled for her phone. She called Kyla Corbyn to tell her about the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After hearing this, Kyla Corbyn said, "Come back first. If they have any requests, they should talk to me after we close for the day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace did not put the speaker on, those around her did not hear what Kyla Corbyn said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right," replied Grace as she ended the call and put her phone away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she put it away, she stealthily turned on her phone's recording function.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, when are you paying us?" asked one of them. He looked like the leader.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace chuckled and said, "Do you know that 5,000 dollars is a big amount in fraud? If there's a sentence, you could be looking at up to three years in prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The people around Grace immediately took on a ghastly expression. "What do you mean? Are you saying I'm committing fraud?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whether you're committing fraud can be proven with the evidence. Look, there are a lot of fans with their phones up around here. Maybe someone accidentally took some pictures. Besides, this order can't be free of charge. As for the lunchbox in question, we can leave it to the police to investigate. That&rsquo;ll be fair to everyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crew looked at each other, and the leader glared at Grace as he said, "I&rsquo;m warning you, you'd better get your boss to pay us. Otherwise, your restaurant can think about closing down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that a threat?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I am threatening you, so what?" the man said bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By now, it was clear to Grace that these people had been trying to blackmail them from the start.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just an employee. There's no need for you to threaten me. As for this lunchbox, you can keep it for the police, and..."Grace paused and looked at them coldly. "If you&rsquo;re going to do something irrational with a small restaurant like ours, I can tell you that we'll sue you. By then, it won't be just 5,000 dollars."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that Kyla Corbyn was not rich. Nelson's cochlear implant, in particular, needed a lot of money. Even if he had cochlear implants in the future, she would need to spend on some training courses to teach him how to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace opened her mouth to warn these people, she had already made up her mind to go to Jason for help if necessary.</p></div>
