        <h1>Chapter 2138</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He thought he had prepared everything, but there was still a loophole and it was enough to kill Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Little by little, Lina drank the blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He thought it would take a long time to feed Lina the blood but it only took a short while. In the end, Lina seemed to be instinctively attracted by the blood as she started swallowing herself even though she was in a coma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After Lina finished drinking the blood, Hadwin Stephenson carefully wiped his wife's lip and looked at her expectantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace and Kyla seemed to be holding their breaths, fearing that the blood would not work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although the little boy was considered their last hope, could his blood save Lina? They could not be sure until they saw Lina wake up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Fortunately, after about ten minutes, Lina's eyelashes quivered slightly. Then, she slowly opened her eyes as everyone watched her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was a look of surprise on Hadwin Stephenson's face. "Lina, you're awake? You're awake!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina seemed to be stuck in a trance. Looking at the disheveled Hadwin Stephenson, she said hoarsely after a while, "Why did you become uglier when I've just... given birth... Where's the baby? How's... the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The baby's fine. She's fine... She&rsquo;s very fine!" Hadwin Stephenson pretty much babbled while Jason had someone call the doctors and nurses to check on Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all this, it was nearly midnight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctor gave Lina a preliminary examination and said that the patient was doing well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina fell asleep again after staying awake for half an hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It made Hadwin Stephenson nervous. He was scared that his wife would never wake up again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It probably won't happen again. Since the boy was confident that his blood could wake Lina up and save her, it won&rsquo;t lose its effect so soon. Lina is just a little tired from having woken up not long ago. She should wake up again after a nap." Grace comforted Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even so, Hadwin Stephenson still stayed at Lina's bedside nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Thank you for today. Go home first. I'll accompany Lina," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Get some sleep too. You haven't slept well in days." She heard Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney say that Hadwin Stephenson would sometimes lie on Lina's hospital bed to take a nap. He would wake up after half an hour or an hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It would be hard for anyone to survive with so little sleep every day, even if they were in good health.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why don't you get some rest too?" Grace advised him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Hadwin Stephenson seemed not to hear her at all. Grace knew he probably would not listen to her anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The group left the hospital. Grace and Jason were on one side, while Kyla and Martin Weiss were on the other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the way, Grace asked Jason, "Do you know who the Hunter family is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason said, "Yes, I do. Old master Reed mentioned them when he was alive. They're a secretive yet strong family. Otherwise, Old master Reed wouldn't have specifically warned me not to become enemies with the Hunter family unless absolutely necessary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then why were you willing to make an enemy of that family earlier?" Grace asked with some doubts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What else could I do? If Lina fell into a vegetative state and had to lay in bed all her life, you would probably be unhappy all your life, wouldn't you?" he said. He was well-aware of her fated friendship with Lina.</p></div>
