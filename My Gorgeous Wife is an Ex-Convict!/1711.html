        <h1>Chapter 1709</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before Jason left, he stared at Mason again. His eyes seemed to be thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason kept his head down in silence after they got back in the car. Grace asked, "What are you thinking about?" He instantly came back to his senses and smiled faintly, saying, "Nothing. Let's go back to Reed Residence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At night, a figure arrived at the mourning hall. Jason walked in and looked at the black and white photo of his father hanging in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the photo, his father looked gentle. There was a soft smile on his lips. There seemed to be a hint of joy in his deep eyes too, as though they carried rays of sunshine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he looked at the shape of his father&rsquo;s eyes, they were somewhat similar to the boy called Mason whom he met today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had only given the child a cursory glance at the amusement park before this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although he had heard about the child from Grace, it was only today that he got a good look at the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He did not think of it at first but then he realized... the child's eyes looked like his father's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was just that the look in those eyes was different!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He slowly entered the inner hall, where there was a woman's photo in front of his father's memorial tablet. It was... the woman who had abandoned him and his father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The outline of this woman had been imprinted in his mind for too many years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, looking at the woman in the photo now, some features seemed to overlap with Mason&rsquo;s features. The child's lips and forehead... bore a resemblance!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The curvature of their earlobes looked similar as well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it possible? Could it be what I&rsquo;m thinking? The child's... an orphan that the He family adopted. The fact that he's an orphan fits the requisite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If it's as my speculation, why did Secretary Wang give the child to the He family? Or was it a coincidence? Did the He family want a child, so they adopted him? How did the child end up at an orphanage instead of with Secretary Wang?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">For a moment, there were too many questions in his mind but no one could answer them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together tightly. Moments later, he took out his phone and made a call. "Help me look into a five-year-old boy named Mason Swanson. I want all his history and the information about his adopted family. Also, look for a way to get a sample of the boy's blood."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In any case, he had to find out if it was as he thought!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just as Jason finished giving his instructions and put away his phone, he heard footsteps coming over. He looked up to see a thin figure walking toward him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What are you doing here?" asked Grace, who had just put her two children to bed. A maid told her he was at the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She knew that he did not usually come here. Apart from coming here on tomb-sweeping day, winter solstice, and the anniversary of his father's death, he would only be here if he was in a bad mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Today isn't one of those special days, so does that mean... he's in a bad mood?' wondered Grace.</p></div>
