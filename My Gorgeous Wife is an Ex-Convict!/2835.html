        <h1>Chapter 2833</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I like it. It's beautiful," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me help you with the jewelry," he said, taking the sapphire necklace and helping her put it on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The rich and delicate necklace added a touch of classiness to her when she wore it around her smooth neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why aren't you apologizing?" Just then, Brian's voice rang out again, but he was now talking to Phoebe Cross and the rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They instantly looked at each other. Phoebe Cross even looked shocked. "You... You want me to apologize?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shouldn't you? Since you know Valda is my girlfriend, you should know what to say and what not to say." His indifferent voice gave people a faint sense of danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian leaned over, picked up the sapphire earrings, and carefully helped Valda Theller put them on. This gentle gesture was in sharp contrast to the indifferent tone he had just used to speak to Phoebe Cross.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross clenched her teeth. She had admired him since she was a child, but he had never considered having her as his girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He constantly looked for the little girl who saved him during his childhood, so every girlfriend before this was just a substitute for that little girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He finally stopped looking for a substitute and was single for years, but he found such an unclassy girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does Valda Theller have that I don't?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, do you really want me to apologize to this woman?" Phoebe Cross asked, staring at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not only you but everyone here!" Brian said indifferently. He had no intention of sparing any woman who had criticized Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The atmosphere was suffocating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian just calmly helped Valda Theller put on the earrings. "I don't have time to wait around. Get out if you won't apologize."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, no one dared guess what the cost of leaving would be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the crown prince had never been someone who played by the rules.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the others rushed to apologize to Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Theller, I'm sorry. It was our fault just now. We apologize."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, be the bigger person. Forgive us!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller politely responded, while Brian glanced at Phoebe Cross and snorted indifferently. "Hmm?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross shivered and finally lowered her head before saying to Valda Theller, "I'm sorry I said something I shouldn't have."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then please don't say anything you shouldn't say in the future, Miss Song," answered Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Phoebe Cross's expression changed slightly as she glared at Valda Theller and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Several other women followed Phoebe Cross, leaving Brian, Valda Theller, the makeup artist, and the makeup artist's assistant in the makeup room.</p></div>
