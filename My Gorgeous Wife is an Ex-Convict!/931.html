        <h1>Chapter 930</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this man&hellip; the benefactor... the paralegal mentioned?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What benefactor could have such power?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason glanced coldly at the man who was not wearing a mask. Then, he ordered his subordinate who was following him. "Take good care of this man later and let him know what it feels like to be slapped."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," the subordinate answered. 'The moment Master Reed asked me to take care of this fellow, he&rsquo;s probably going to suffer,&rdquo; he thought to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man without a mask trembled. When he saw Jason trying to carry Grace into a nearby black Bentley, the man suddenly shouted, "Who the hell are you? Is... Is she really a mere paralegal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could someone create such a commotion for a mere paralegal who's not even a stunning beauty?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man just felt like everything was getting out of hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought he only accepted a deal, but look at how it turned out!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No one answered him as Jason had already gotten into the car with Grace in his arms. Then, the car slowly drove away from the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, Grace said to Jason, "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it had not been for him, she would have suffered today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was smart of you to contact me. Do you know who you've offended?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shook her head. She had offended some people, but not enough for anyone to do such a thing. Therefore, for a moment, she could not think of anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's the second time," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Second time?" She was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't someone try to hurt you near the neighborhood you currently live in? It's the second time now," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You mean... They're from the same gang?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We can find out after checking," Jason said coldly. However, his gaze softened when he saw the messy state she was in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it hurt a lot?" he asked softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sort of, but... it's tolerable," she said. The burning pain in her cheeks was less severe than the pain she had experienced in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned and caressed the trail of blood that oozed from the corner of her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those slaps had injured the corners of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's just some blood. I can just wipe it off," she said, trying to take out a tissue to wipe the oozing blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he held her hand and said, "Don't bother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does he mean by that?' She blinked her eyes and saw his face magnifying before her eyes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt something warm and moist on the corners of her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He... He's licking my blood!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly stiffened, and she could feel a terrible burn on the spot he had licked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea how long it took, but he seemed to finally clean up the blood at the corner of her lips. He touched his forehead lightly against hers and said with a hint of self-reproach, "I'm sorry you were hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does he have any idea how ambiguous this is?' thought Grace, but she could not seem to lift her stiff arm at the moment, let alone push him away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not your fault&hellip; I was hurt. It's good enough that you could come and save me," she said before gulping suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's not my fault?' Jason laughed at himself. "I didn't protect you well. The last thing I want is for you to get hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent. She could smell his scent, and it was so intimate.</p></div>
