        <h1>Chapter 2140</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He stared at the person on the hospital bed, not wanting to miss a minute of her. He feared that something might happen to her, but he did not notice anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sometime later, Lina finally opened her eyes again when the sky outside the window lit up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stiffened all of a sudden. He only looked blankly at her eyes that were opened. Tears instantly poured out of his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter... I... I just took a little nap. Why are you crying..." muttered Lina as she raised her hand to wipe away his tears. However, she found that her arms were so sore that she had no energy to lift them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson put Lina's hand on his cheek as he mumbled, "Okay, I won't cry. I won't cry!" He tried to hold back his tears and kissed her hand from the fingertips to the palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where's Grace? Have they gone back?" she asked with some difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, they went back yesterday. They were up late worrying over you. They'll probably come to the hospital to visit you again in the morning. They&rsquo;ve been coming to the hospital to visit you every day these days," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"These days?" Lina seemed to finally realize that more time had passed than she thought. "How long have I been sleeping?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You&rsquo;ve been sleeping for 13 days," said Hadwin Stephenson. He had been counting the minutes and seconds of every day that passed since she fell into a coma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was shocked. She felt like she had just given birth. Who knew it had already been 13 days?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"By the way, where's the baby?" She remembered that the baby was still in the ward when she woke up, but now... the baby was not here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The nurse took the baby to another ward, lest she disturbed you. I'll ask them to bring the baby here in the morning," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina finally felt relieved. "Have you had a rough... 13 days?" Judging from his present state, she could almost guess how he had spent these 13 days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson murmured, "Everything's alright now that you're awake. Lina, I was so scared of losing you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Silly pie, I wouldn&rsquo;t have let you marry another woman and let my daughter call another woman &lsquo;Mom&rsquo;. Even if I'm in a coma, I&rsquo;ll try my best to wake up! How could I leave you when you're so handsome?" She joked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He could not help smiling when he heard that. She had always been able to make him relax.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But no one will say you're handsome... if you go out looking like this... Even if I'm in a coma, you should eat well, sleep well, and dress well. How miserable would I be if you collapsed when I woke up?" she continued lecturing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay... Okay, I'll clean myself up, have a good meal, and have a good rest!" he said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She looked at the obvious dark circles under his eyes. "Why don't you go to sleep now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Now?" Hadwin Stephenson froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, now. My hospital bed is big enough for you to sleep on anyway. Take a nap on this bed. I haven't slept with my husband for a long time..." she mumbled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But... I don't want to crush you," he said with hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You won't. You're a good sleeper. You never move around." She was the one who moved around. She would often put her hands and legs on him. Sometimes, she would kick the blanket as well as him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But I haven't showered in days. I'm... dirty..." He continued to hesitate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "I don't mind it! I don't mind how dirty you are," she said as tears welled in her eyes.</p></div>
