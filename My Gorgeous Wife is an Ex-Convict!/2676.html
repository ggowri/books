        <h1>Chapter 2674</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Stop all the meaningless talk," Raymond Bowman interrupted. Then, he pulled away Barbara Schuman's arms that were around his waist. "I don't love you now, and I never will love you again. Barbara Schuman, watch out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All was well with the film set in the next few days. Nothing happened, and Barbara Schuman did not come to the film crew anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller went to the film set two or three times a week to assist in fixing the script.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda Theller went over today, they were shooting the second female lead and male lead's scenes. There was a scene where the second female lead ran into debt collectors at the park. It was the second female lead's father who was in debt, but they came to her because he was missing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The second female lead was meeting the male lead in the park. Just when the second female lead saw the male lead and wanted to walk up to greet him, the debt collectors found her. Therefore, they dragged the second female lead to concealed bushes in the park and beat her up. The male lead thought the second female lead stood him up and left gloomily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This scene was the key plot of the comic. It was where the twist in the characters' fate started.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Queenie Mack, who played the second female lead, wanted to change the plot. "Director, Scriptwriter, I think it doesn't make sense to have the second female lead stay silent here. The male lead is so close that she should shout for the male lead to save her! It&rsquo;d be better if you let the male lead save the damsel in distress!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack joined the cast through an investment. She even had a designated scriptwriter who could modify the script for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the director and the scriptwriter in charge of Queenie Mack were dissatisfied with such changes in the script, they sometimes turned a blind eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today, Queenie Mack wanted to change the main plot, so the director and the scriptwriter disagreed. Hence, an argument started.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller eventually became the center of attention. Queenie Mack said the original plot did not make sense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could only say, "The second female lead loves the male lead and knows it's difficult for the male lead to save her from so many fierce debt collectors even if she were to call for help. She might even cause the male lead to get hurt. At the same time, she&rsquo;s too proud to let the male lead know about her miserable situation. It&rsquo;s this combination of circumstances that led her to make this choice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Queenie Mack did not accept Valda Theller's explanation. "I still think we need to change it. I don't like how my character will be beaten up in the bushes. My fans can't accept such a scene either!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you don't want to act in the scene where you&rsquo;re dragged into the bushes and beaten up, we can have your stand-in do it for you. We'll just need some close-up shots of your face," the assistant director nearby said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Queenie Mack looked upset, clearly displeased with the assistant director's answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scriptwriter in charge said, "Yuejing, this scene is related to what happens later. If we change it, too many scenes will be affected."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't think so. You can find another reason to separate the male lead from the second female lead. If you think changing it is too troublesome, I can ask my scriptwriter to do it!" Queenie Mack said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "We can't change it. If we do, the second female lead won't be the proud yet low self-esteemed character who's willing to sacrifice herself for the one she loves that I intended her to be."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller rejected. It was her stance for her creation and the characters she created. Some things could be changed, but she would insist on her stance if it involved character changes.</p></div>
