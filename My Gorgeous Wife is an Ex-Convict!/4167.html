        <h1>Chapter 4165 Will They Agree?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina looked at her mother with delight on her face. Truly, she had a great mom!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin looked at his wife in astonishment. "You agree to their marriage?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Tina is already 20 years old. She can distinguish between right and wrong. Besides, Chandler is a child we've watched grow up. Don't you know what kind of person he is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even so, for Hadwin, his daughter getting married now was still too early. No matter how he thought about it, she was still a little girl. How could she be getting married?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I disagree. Tina is still too young," Hadwin rarely opposed his wife's opinion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "So, do you really want your daughter to end up pregnant and get married, or have a child and be called a bastard?" Lina retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin stumbled, "But it hasn't been confirmed yet. Maybe she's not pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Even if not this time, what about the next time?" Lina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin's face turned grim. Another time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Since Tina wants to marry Chandler, as parents, shouldn't we respect our children's decisions? Isn't that good?" Lina said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Hadwin remained silent, but his expression clearly showed his unwillingness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> So, Lina turned to Chandler and Tina and said, "Alright, Chandler, you take Tina to your place for a couple of days. Your father and I will discuss your marriage."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Okay," Chandler obediently agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina made faces at her mother, signaling her with her eyebrows, pleading for her mom to handle her dad!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After all, in this family, the only one who could handle the father was the mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina responded by making faces back at her daughter, assuring her that she would handle it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> With their signal exchange complete, Tina quickly pulled Chandler away from the Stephenson family. Hadwin didn't even have time to stop them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You're not worried that Tina is getting married so young?" Hadwin glared at his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You say young, but she's actually not that young. She's already 20," Lina said. When she was 20, she was quite independent. And it seemed like her daughter was even more independent than she was at that age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "She's 20, but she's still a student!" Hadwin argued.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are you so against Tina marrying Chandler?" Lina asked. "Tell me, what's wrong with Chandler?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin paused, displeased. "He shouldn't have gotten involved with Tina in the first place!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But Tina said it was her own choice," Lina replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Even if it was her choice, can't Chandler tolerate that?" Hadwin retorted irritably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina smiled and suddenly pushed her husband down onto the couch. "Well, what about when we first met and I made the first move? Why couldn't you tolerate it then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin blushed, a rare sight. "Back then... it's the same as now, back then I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's different? Did you only play with me back then?" Lina reached out and gently caressed her husband's face, his eyes, nose, and lips...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although time had passed, her husband still looked so handsome in her eyes, captivating her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course not!" Hadwin exclaimed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If back then, after we spent the night together, I didn't leave but instead asked you to marry me, would you have agreed?" Lina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin fell silent, understanding the meaning behind her question.</p></div>
