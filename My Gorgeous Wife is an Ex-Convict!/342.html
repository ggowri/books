        <h1>Chapter 341</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was not in the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then where could he be? Downstairs?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Grace got downstairs, Jason was not there either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even went out of the house after not finding him in the main house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Reed Residence was very large. Besides the main house, there were the servants' rooms, the garden, other pavilions, and ponds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After living in Reed Residence for so long, she had never really explored Reed Residence and had no idea how big it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was nearly midnight, and as far as the eye could see, it was dark except for a few lights along the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The night wind was a little chilly and Grace could not help turning up her collar. She could not help wondering why she was looking for Jason. Was she afraid that something might have happened to him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What else could happen to him in Reed Residence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At last, she could only explain to herself that he had saved her life today and that she just wanted peace of mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a flash of light caught her attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She saw what looked like a little detached house a little way ahead, and bright lights were shining through its windows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only when Grace approached it that she found the plaque in front of the house. It read &lsquo;Mourning Hall&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace got quite a fright. She walked up and gently pushed open the door. What she saw was a spacious ante-chamber with a framed black and white photograph of a man on the wall right ahead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was a very handsome man, somewhat bookish looking. He had some gentleness in his eyes. The man looked a little like Jason, but Jason&rsquo;s beauty was more stunning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe it was because of their eyes. The man's eyes were more like Old Master Reed's eyes, which were different from Jason's amorous eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had an answer in her mind. This man was probably Jason's father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just did not expect that his father was such a gentle-looking man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only knew from Jason that his mother had left him and his father. She had not thought much of it back then. After all, she used to see cases like this all the time at the law firm. This also happened in many case studies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now when she saw the picture, everything felt different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What kind of woman would leave such a gentle-looking man? Did the woman ever regret that the man just died like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What brought you here?" Grace jumped when a voice suddenly rang in the quiet space.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately turned her head and saw Jason standing a short distance away, his deep black eyes staring at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... I'm looking for you," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Looking for me?" He raised his eyebrows slightly, approached her, and said, "What do you need?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip. There was nothing at all. She was just afraid that something might have happened to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hmm?" His eyes were still on her, waiting for her reply.</p></div>
