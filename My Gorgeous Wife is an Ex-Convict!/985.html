        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stood up suddenly and leaned over the table before reaching out to take her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" She let out a cry and made a conscious attempt to pull her hand back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his hand grabbed hers firmly, pulling it to his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you feel it? It's beating faster than usual," he muttered as his thick black eyelashes fluttered. "Do you know how fast it was beating yesterday when I saw the man who wanted to hurt you following you out of shot from the surveillance footage?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He chuckled softly, half-confiding and half-sighing. "It was so fast that my heart felt as if it would burst. It became difficult to even breathe. My hands were shaking so hard I could hardly hold a glass of water."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words, along with that elegant voice, crept into her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She watched him intently. Every word he said seemed like a heavy weight on her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, do you still think I don't love you?" His phoenix eyes stared at her while her surprised look was reflected in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had never expected him to tell her such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hand that was against his heart seemed to be burning up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." She opened her mouth to say something but did not know exactly what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace," he called out her name. "You can doubt anything but the fact that I love you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the simple square table, the handsome man leaned forward and pressed the woman's right palm against his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman stared at the man in shock, bewilderment, and something more complicated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, the man and woman seemed to be stuck in their own world&mdash;separated from the world around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The people in the diner looked at the two people. A few girls who looked like students even picked up their phones to secretly take photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unnoticed by the diner's customers, several black cars had pulled up outside. A tall figure came to a halt when they reached the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their bright eyes stared at the two people who were looking at each other while the blood on their face seemed to fade instantly. At this moment, the person&rsquo;s face was utterly pale. Then, the man touched his heart with his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A surge of pain rose from his heart, and with each heartbeat, it traveled through his bones and limbs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Ouch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It hurts so much!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason clenched his teeth and looked at the scene that was causing him pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this also the pain... she&rsquo;s giving me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's so swift and violent! The pain is almost unbearable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I no longer love her, no? I only regard her as a sister now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why does it hurt so much just to see her with Brian? The pain is even more unbearable than yesterday when I saw Brian confessing his love for her at the police station.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A bodyguard immediately hurried forward and asked, "Master Reed, are you okay?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Make everyone else in this restaurant leave! Seal up the area ten meters from the entrance!" Jason ordered with a slight gasp.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!" answered the bodyguard.</p></div>
