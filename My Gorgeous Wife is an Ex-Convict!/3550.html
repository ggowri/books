        <h1>Chapter 3548</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's eyes flickered. He could indeed help with the investigation, but... "Why don't you ask your father to help you? After all, the Reed family has been searching for Lawrence's whereabouts for years, and if Uncle Reed sends someone to investigate, it would be much more efficient than here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because if Roger is really Lawrence, he may not want to admit it, perhaps for some unavoidable reason. So, for now, I don't want the adults to know," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lowered his eyelids gently and after a while, he said, "Okay, I'll help you investigate."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He would never refuse her request, even if the result of the investigation might not be what he wanted to see. As long as it was her hope, he would do it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, William's investigation was conducted through the Barlow family's connections and involved looking into the other party's life before the age of 10, so it naturally took some time and effort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During this time, Jasper didn't just sit around waiting. Instead, she took advantage of the campus gossip and actively approached Roger to try and find out if he was Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper didn't have to spend much effort to find out which class Roger was in. After all, on the school forum, there was a photo of her and Roger seemingly kissing, and someone had already identified Roger's name and class based on his back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What surprised her, however, was that Roger was actually a chemistry student, the same age as her, and a freshman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger also came to the piano room at school to practice the piano two or three days a week.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On this day, when Roger came to the piano room to practice, Jasper deliberately waited outside the room, listening to the faint sound of the piano coming from the door. She listened quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This way of interpreting music, the piano sound should give people a feeling... While Roger's fingers moved on the black and white keys inside, outside, Jasper closed her eyes and moved her ten fingers in the air, as if playing the same piece in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this way, two people, one inside and one outside, but the movements played by their fingers were synchronized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One piece after another, until Roger finished practicing and walked out of the piano room, he saw Jasper still mimicking the posture of playing the piano with her ten fingers in the air, as if she was still immersed in the aftertaste of the music.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And the sound of him opening the door seemed to startle her. She opened her beautiful almond eyes and looked at him, "You played very well just now, and the pieces you played today were all difficult. Do you like playing difficult pieces?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He withdrew his gaze, as if he couldn't be bothered, and walked straight out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, wait a minute." She hurried after him and stood in front of him, taking the initiative to say, "How about we become friends?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her and said, "There's no need for that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why not? Everyone in the school thinks we're friends now," she said. To be more precise, everyone in the school thinks they have an "ambiguous" relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what?" he said coldly. "You can tell others that we're not."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But no one believes it," she said, touching her nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at her and suddenly asked, "Do you want to be friends with me because you still think I'm the Lawrence you mentioned?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was taken aback, feeling as if he had seen through her little thoughts.</p></div>
