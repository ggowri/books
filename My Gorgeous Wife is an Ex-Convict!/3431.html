        <h1>Chapter 3429</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Family? Important little brother?" Mason suddenly sneered, "Then what is Daniel to you, someone you like?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A shy and embarrassed expression appeared on her face. Did she like Daniel? She wasn't sure if she really liked him, after all, they hadn't spent much time together. But she couldn't deny that she had a good impression of Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her current expression made her stand out even more. "You can't like Daniel," he said firmly, "If you want to like someone, you can only like me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared at him blankly, not understanding what he meant until his lips kissed her cheek. She tried to turn away, "Mason, don't do this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, you don't have to like Daniel, you just have to like me!" he whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't dislike you, it's just a different kind of liking! I like you as a family member, but as for Daniel..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What kind of liking do you have for him? Do you like him as a boyfriend?" His lips approached the cheek where she had been slapped by her father this morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the redness from the slap had faded somewhat, Grace could still see it if she looked closely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who hit you?" he suddenly asked, his voice tinged with anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not much," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who hit you?" he couldn't tolerate it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My dad," Veronica said. "I talked back to him this morning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes grew angry. "Even if it's him, he can't hit you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He hasn't dared to hit me for many years," Veronica said. "He was probably just angry today and lost control."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She guessed that he regretted hitting her now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she knew that even if her father really regretted it, it was probably only because he was afraid of making Mason angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, let go of me first. It's hard for me to talk to you like this," she said. The current position, coupled with his kiss just now, made her feel even more dangerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he seemed not to hear her, just leaned in and licked her swollen cheek gently. "Lick it, it won't hurt so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shuddered and her hair stood on end, then she almost pushed him away with all her strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He didn't expect it and was caught off guard when she pushed him, causing him to stumble back two or three steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica gasped and said in a slightly panicked tone, "Don't do this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you hate me?" He stared at her. "But when we were kids, didn't we do this all the time? When I got hurt, you would lick me, and when you got hurt, I would lick you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica pursed her lips tightly. Yes, that's how they were back then, especially before Mason found his roots. They were like two lonely little animals, cuddling up to each other for warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now things are different. They are no longer children. They have grown up and some of their actions are no longer appropriate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I just need to apply some ointment. There's no need to lick it like a child!" she said, as if trying to prove something. She reached into her pocket and quickly pulled out a tube of ointment. "See, I have ointment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's expression turned even more unpleasant when he saw the ointment in her hand. "Did Daniel give this to you?"</p></div>
