She looked up at him in surprise, but was stunned when she saw the smile on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He actually smiled?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the smile was faint, it was beautiful, and it had been so long since she had seen him smile like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It made her nostalgic.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After finishing lunch, Veronica and Mason went to the movie theater upstairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Watching a movie together is something most couples do, although...they weren't officially a couple yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is there any particular movie you want to see?" Veronica asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No," Mason replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This answer was within her expectations, so Veronica said, "Then I'll go buy the movie tickets."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'll go buy it. What do you want to watch?" Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then... let's watch 'True Heart'," she said. It's a low-budget film that has recently received high praise, and she wanted to see it after reading good reviews.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason went to buy the movie tickets, while Veronica went to the other counter to buy drinks and popcorn.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was buying, she suddenly heard a voice, "Sister Veronica!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica turned around and saw Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Jasper." Veronica was surprised. Why does she keep running into unexpected people today?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sister Veronica, are you here to watch a movie?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Veronica replied, then looked at William standing next to Jasper. "Are you guys here to watch a movie too?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, Jasper and I came to watch a movie together today," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William seemed to be deep in thought after hearing Veronica's "too".</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, Sister Veronica, are you here alone or with friends..." Jasper's words trailed off as he looked behind Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica followed his gaze and saw that Mason was standing behind her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason!" Mason looked shocked. "Are you guys... here to watch the movie together?" After all, Mason was holding two movie tickets in his hand.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why not?" Mason asked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was suddenly at a loss for words. He looked at Mason and then at Veronica. What on earth was going on? Did she... miss something?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For a moment, a silent atmosphere enveloped the four of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was William who broke the silence, "Which movie are you guys watching?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Sincere Heart," Veronica replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Same here. Is it the same showing?" Jasper asked, looking at his friend Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason pursed his lips, "The showing in fifteen minutes."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, what a coincidence!" Jasper laughed, "Today, Mason, Sister Veronica, and I are watching a movie together. Did you guys plan to watch it together?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, on a date," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was shocked again, while Veronica laughed awkwardly, knowing how much impact Mason's words would have on Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, their relationship had almost reached a freezing point before, and now such explosive information was revealed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking back to herself, she couldn't believe how much their relationship had changed so suddenly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"A date?" Jasper was stunned, feeling wave after wave of shock.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was Mason really on a date with Sister Veronica? What was their relationship now?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't stop thinking about this question even as they entered the theater.</span></p></div>
