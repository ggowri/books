        <h1>Chapter 862</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had not seen Chase Harper in a few days, so she thought he had figured it out. However, she could feel it in the way he looked at her. He did not seem to have... given up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I happen to be busy today. I have to pick up a child. I promised him I'll take him to the amusement park today. About the clues you mentioned..." Grace was in a dilemma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she did not want to change the deal she made with the little one. She did not want to see the little one disappointed, but it was work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, the more clues they had, the higher the possibility of them getting compensation for Baldwin!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After seeing Baldwin lying unconscious in the hospital bed, Grace sincerely wanted to help the young man and his family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll send you over to pick the child up and we can talk about the clues on our way there," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought about it. 'That works too.' Therefore, she got into Chase Harper's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the way, Chase Harper drove while telling her about the details that he carefully recalled afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was following Baldwin's car, so he was the first to see the crash. He saw two people getting out of the car, but the thing was, both of them got out from the driver&rsquo;s side!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she read the police's investigation report, it was clearly written that one was sitting in the driver's seat while the other one was in the passenger seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If they got out from the same side at the same time&hellip; One should have gotten out from the driver's seat while the other one from the passenger seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, another possibility was that... the driver and the non-driver might have deliberately swapped identities!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think so. It's just that the police didn't ask, so I didn't bring it up. Recently, when I saw other people getting out of their cars, the detail suddenly came back to me. I found it strange, so that's why I came looking for you to tell you," said Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was absorbed in thought, filtering the transcripts of the case through her mind. The place where the crime took place had no surveillance cameras, so everything was based on what happened at the time and what the witnesses said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Chase Harper said might be enough to disprove the previous police investigation report!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the car had already pulled up to Nelson's side. The little one and Mrs. Corbyn were already waiting on the side of the road.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the little one saw Grace, he immediately gave a beaming smile. However, he then looked curiously at Chase Harper who was standing beside Grace. He asked in his cute voice, "Is this man coming to the amusement park with us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before Grace could answer, Chase Harper had already bent down and asked Nelson, "Is it okay if I want to follow you to the amusement park?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson blinked as he looked at the honest-looking man before him and nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper seemed relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace spotted Chase Harper's shy smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"May I... I can be your driver today, and when we're free, well... we can talk about the case... Also, I haven't been to the amusement park for a long time. I kinda miss it."</p></div>
