        <h1>Chapter 3089</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Valda took a step back, but she forgot that there was a sofa behind her. Then she stumbled and ended up sitting on the sofa.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Brian finally lifted her long skirt, revealing her slightly deformed right calf that caught his eye.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">She wanted to pull down her skirt, but he was pressing down on her hand, preventing her from doing so.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Didn&#x27;t you show it to me before? Why... don&#x27;t you want me to see it now?&quot; he asked.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;There&#x27;s...nothing worth seeing,&quot; Valda said, lowering her head. &quot;Just like you said, you&#x27;ve already seen it, so why bother seeing it again?&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;But... I want to look at it a little more.&quot; He fixed his gaze on her right calf, and his slender fingers gently stroked the deformed area. &quot;It&#x27;s because you wanted to protect me that you got hurt like this, right Valda? You really, really love me, don&#x27;t you?&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;No!&quot; She quickly denied, &quot;I... I used to love you very much, but now I feel that this feeling is not as strong as it used to be. Also, I didn&#x27;t get hurt just to save you. At that time, I was trying to save Jasmine, and it had nothing to do with you.&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Are you sure?&quot; When he heard her say that her feelings for him were not as strong as they used to be, his heart twisted with pain. </span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Even though he told himself that she said it probably because she felt insecure, he was still heartbroken. </span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Valda, when you saved Jasmine back then, was it because you didn&#x27;t want me to blame myself and suffer? Were you afraid that I would feel guilty towards Grace and be in unbearable pain?&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Hearing that, Valda fell silent.</span></span></span> <span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">She lowered her head, afraid to look at his face at the moment.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;Have you ever thought about what would happen if you were gone? Do you really think that I would rather you risk your life to save Jasmine?&quot; Brian whispered.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;That is...the best choice. If something happens to Jasmine, many people will be heartbroken. But...if something happens to me, even though everyone will be sad and upset, it won&#x27;t be too serious. They won’t be so devastated that they can’t carry on with their lives,&quot; Valda said in a hesitant tone.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">Brian forced a bitter smile and said, &quot;Do you really think so? Then what about me? Have you ever thought of how I would feel?&quot;</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;What do you mean? I...I don&#x27;t understand,&quot; she stammered.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">&quot;You don&#x27;t.</span></span></span> <span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">When you were in trouble, I almost went mad. Do you know how I managed to stay alive?&quot; he said.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">She slowly lifted her head and couldn&#x27;t help but let her gaze fall on the man kneeling in front of her. Her heart seemed to suddenly beat faster.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align:justify;" class="p" align="justify"><span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">She saw his mouth opening and closing as he spoke, &quot;It&#x27;s just that because I haven&#x27;t found you yet, I&#x27;m still alive. I won&#x27;t let anyone tell me you&#x27;re probably dead.</span></span></span> <span style="color:#222222"><span style="letter-spacing:0ptpx"><span style="font-size:10.5ptpx">But I keep telling myself that if one day, you&#x27;re actually dead, then I&#x27;ll kill myself.&quot;</span></span></span></p></div>
