        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What he liked...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was simply having her company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, he was afraid that saying it like this would only increase her </span><span>psychological burden, so he smiled and said, "Alright, I'll think about it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, for now, let's have a date like we usually do. You can take me on a date," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe doing some of the things they used to do would help her memories to come back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After looking at so many old photos and videos of her and Chandler, she felt that if she couldn't remember those things, it would be a kind of regret.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But can your body handle it?" Chandler was a bit worried.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Actually, my body is already quite fine. The doctor even suggested that I do more activities," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright then," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The activities Chandler chose for the following plans were relatively low in physical exertion, such as watching a movie or having tea.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the two of them finished their meal and were about to go to the parking lot, Tina caught a glimpse of a wedding photo hanging on a glass wall in the mall.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the happily married couple in the photo, Tina suddenly said, "Did we take wedding photos back then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We did," Chandler's voice was somewhat hoarse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want to see them," Tina turned to look at Chandler. "Can you show me those photos?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the Stephenson family, although her mother had given her many photos and videos of her and Chandler's past, she hadn't given her any photos or videos related to her wedding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she speculated that it was possible that because of the incident she encountered on her wedding day, there was nothing in her home related to her marriage at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Chandler agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Driving, Chandler took Tina directly to his place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was also the first time Tina came to Chandler's place after losing her memory.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Strangely, she had a familiar feeling about this place. Even when she was thirsty and wanted to drink water, she would instinctively take out the couple's cup she and Chandler bought together from the cabinet and prepare to pour water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do I come here often?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm," he responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina couldn't help but smile. It seemed that even though she lost her memory, her body still retained some instinctive habits.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then, Chandler showed her their wedding photos and some videos taken on their wedding day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Tina sat on the sofa, watching the wedding scenes playing on the large screen in the living room, her emotions fluctuated.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked beautiful and happy in the video.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when she stood side by side with Chandler and they smiled at each other, anyone could see that they were in love with each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She loved this man deeply!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And at this moment, she felt a strange affection in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler." Tina suddenly turned around and spoke to him sitting beside her, "Can I hug you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was somewhat surprised but did not object, "Of course you can."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So she approached him and embraced his waist with both hands, burying her body in his arms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His embrace was warm, and his breath gave her a sense of reassurance.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she didn't resist and chose to slowly accept, she realized that even though her brain had forgotten Chandler, her body remembered him!</span></p></div>
