        <h1>Chapter 1635</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He knew he was jealous, terribly jealous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That was why he did such a thing and said something like that after going out of control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'The Jackson family... Katherine Jackson... Since Katherine Jackson chose this way to test me, there's no need for me to drag it on any longer.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though his plan would be more secure after a little more time, he did not want Lina to be criticized and suffer any more harm. Hence, he would end things now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was already nighttime when Grace learned that her best friend's incident had become hot gossip. Jason casually mentioned it, and she took out her phone to read the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why didn't you tell me earlier? Hadwin Stephenson is just causing her trouble by doing all that. Does he think he's helping Lina by doing that?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He's not an impulsive person. Since he dared to take Lina away in public today, then he must be prepared," Jason said meaningfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What do you mean?" Grace asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If the one Hadwin Stephenson loves is Lina and he only broke up with her for the Jackson family's power, do you think someone like Hadwin Stephenson will be content having the Jackson family manipulate him all the time?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace froze. "Is he going to have a falling out with the Jackson family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He&rsquo;s about to marry the Jackson family. Now that such news has broken out, what he should do is distance himself from Lina, but he did the opposite. Either he has lost his mind, or he's ready to have a falling out with the Jackson family," analyzed Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was silent. She thought Hadwin Stephenson would soon marry Katherine Jackson, but things had taken a sudden turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What will happen to Lina?" She cared about this the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson will naturally protect Lina. If he really intends to make a move on the Jackson family, then maybe he&rsquo;s now protecting Lina so that the Jackson family can't do anything to Lina. After all, Hadwin Stephenson suffered from this same situation back then," analyzed Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace paused and immediately realized it. 'That's right. Didn't Lina suffer serious injuries because of the Stephenson family's internal strife when Hadwin Stephenson's two half-brothers took action against her?' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although Jason's analysis made Grace feel slightly relieved, she still called Lina to check on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Fortunately, there were no restrictions on Lina's phone. Grace was relieved to learn that her best friend and her parents were now in an apartment on the outskirts of tMason Swansonty after getting sent there by Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace also told Lina about Jason's analysis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina paused slightly before speaking, "It has nothing to do with me. I'll think of this as having a few days off for myself. Once this is over, I'll make it clear to Hadwin Stephenson that he should stop." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you sure you won't consider it if he breaks up with Katherine Jackson?" Grace asked hesitantly. After all, she knew how deep Lina's feelings for Hadwin Stephenson were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina murmured, "No. We&rsquo;ve never had anything in common, and we want different things. Besides, five years have passed. Many feelings have changed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stopped speaking after hearing that. After all, the speculation about Hadwin Stephenson was only from Jay's analysis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"If there's anything I can do for you, just let me know. Lina, I can protect you now!" she said.</p></div>
