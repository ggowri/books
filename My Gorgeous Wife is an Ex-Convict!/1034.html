        <h1>Chapter 1033</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You told me here that you&rsquo;d love me for the rest of your life, that you&rsquo;d stay with me forever and never leave me," he murmured while something was burning faintly in his dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shuddered. Back then, he had stood in the mourning hall in the middle of the night, filled with a sense of loneliness and vulnerability that made her heart broke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, she found him here in the middle of the night. Looking at the way he was, she just wanted to give everything she had to protect him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he was insecure, she would do anything to give him a sense of security.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It did not matter if she had to repeatedly say she loved him or acted like she had no memory of her past with Brian during their childhood even if she remembered it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When one thought about it, she had been... willing to do anything for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Now&hellip;' Grace looked at Jason calmly. "So what? Didn't you say you loved me as well? Then you said that you don't love me anymore and want to break up with me. You go back on your words anytime you like."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I don't go back on my words, will you do the same?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haven't you ever heard what's done cannot be undone?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no such thing! I can take it all back, no matter how hard it is," he said, rubbing his cheeks against the palm of her hands. "You know what? I was afraid that I&rsquo;d love you too much and repeat my father's mistakes. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to control my life..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice rang faintly in the mourning hall. He told her the words he never told anyone and the fears he kept hidden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was slightly stunned, surprised at what he was saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He continued, "However, I realized how much I truly love you after breaking up. I love you so much I can't live without you. Therefore, Grace, come back to me, will you? I'll give you whatever you want, even if..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He paused and looked deeply at her. "Even if you want my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He used to find his father's feelings for his mother unintelligible. He only found it ridiculous. Why would someone lose the will to live because of the betrayal and departure of someone else?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, he gradually understood that when one loved someone too much, then once they lost them, life seemed to become meaningless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only feel a mixture of emotions. She glanced past him to the tablet with his father's name engraved on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So? You realize you still love me after breaking up and want to get back together again?" Grace suddenly gave a little chuckle, but there was a hint of sarcasm in it. "Jason, I'm not a toy. I'm not a toy you can break up with and get back together whenever you like!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes darkened. "You don't want to get back together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'"No, I don't!" she answered him affirmatively. "You love me, so you want me to be with you again, but what if the tables are turned? If I love you, but you don't love me anymore, will you say yes if I wanted to get back together with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips were pressed into a tight line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at him, she said, "No, right? If you didn&rsquo;t love me, then you wouldn&rsquo;t look at me even if I got down on my knees and begged you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No ifs." It took him some time to spat this out.</p></div>
