        <h1>Chapter 4415: I Love You</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Aren't you leaving yet? Or do you need my bodyguard to 'escort' you out?" Harley said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's father was taken aback, immediately looking around as if he was deeply afraid that the Hart family's bodyguards would suddenly appear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm?" Harley's nasal voice deepened, his hand about to lift, causing Lornell's father to hurriedly step back.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmph, just you wait!" said Lornell's father, before turning around and leaving.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley turned to look at a pale-faced Calvert. His eyes were clouded with a misty haze, his complexion as white as paper. Despite his towering stature, he seemed incredibly fragile at that moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley pursed his lips, "Let's go into your house first."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>We're already at his doorstep, it would be better to go in and have a chat.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert bit his lip and nodded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two entered the apartment, and Harley, familiar with the place, headed straight to the kitchen. He took some milk out of the fridge, poured it into a cup, and then put it in the microwave to heat up.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In no time, she handed a warm cup of milk to Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have a drink first," she suggested, sensing that Calvert needed to calm his emotions at the moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tha...thanks." Calvert took the cup but didn't drink. He just held it, staring at the milk inside.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why don't you..." Harley's voice suddenly paused, noticing the slight tremble of the cup in Calvert's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's probably because his hand was shaking, which made the cup tremble.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's going on? Why is your hand shaking so much?" Harley grabbed Calvert's hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." He looked up at her. Yes, his hands were shaking badly. Because at this moment, he was scared. Scared that she would misunderstand him, and scared that he was just a prop to stir up Lornell's emotions, just as Lornell had said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you worried that I might misunderstand you?" She took the initiative to speak, as if she had guessed his thoughts.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He bit his lip, and after a while, his voice hoarse, he said, "I didn't scheme against my father for the Hart family's wealth, I..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know!" Harley said, "If you were really scheming, do you think I'd still be going into your house and making you hot milk?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was taken aback as her hand gently rested on the back of his. "So, you don't need to worry about anything. I haven't misunderstood. I know very well, you love me!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His nose tingled, realizing that she was fully aware of his feelings for her.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Also, I'm not sure how much of my conversation with Lornell you overheard, but I came after you to tell you that you're the one I like, the one I love now. When I broke off the engagement, I never intended to get back together with Lornell."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In her view, once a relationship is over, it's over!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she could do it all over again, she would be constantly paranoid, worrying that the day he loses interest in her, he would revert back to his previous level of indifference.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And she, she didn't want to go through all that again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert opened his mouth, hearing his own voice ask, "So, you... you don't see me as a tool either?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley raised an eyebrow, realizing he must have heard what Lornell had said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She cupped his face in her hands and said, "If you're just a tool, then you're one hell of a good-looking one! Do you really have such little faith in yourself? Do you think you're only good for being used, and that it's impossible for me to truly fall in love with you?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert was speechless, just staring blankly at the person in front of him, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley took a long breath and said very seriously, "Calvert, I love you!"</span></p></div>
