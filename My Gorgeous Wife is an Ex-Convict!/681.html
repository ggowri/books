        <h1>Chapter 680</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps when that happened, she would end up miserably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella Lindsay's heart trembled, but now that she had embarked on this path, there was no turning back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would hold on to Brian no matter what. As long as Brian did not know the truth, he would be her biggest backup!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace to the detention center where they met Dexter Rios.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was a middle-aged man in his 40s with a slightly chubby figure and an unfamiliar face. He was just a stranger to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this stranger had done her such a disservice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Without this person, I wouldn't have gone to prison for three years. I wouldn't have had to suffer so much. I&rsquo;d still be a promising female lawyer, doing what I wanted to do for the rest of my life!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At first, Grace thought she would not be able to see Dexter Rios before the court hearing. After all, he had already fled abroad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect to see this man in the detention center so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fear appeared on the man's face when he caught sight of Jason and Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the man stood up and with a thump, he kneeled in front of Grace. "Miss Cummins, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I did you wrong. I did you wrong! I'm willing to accept the punishment of the law. Please, forgive me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at the man kneeling in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This strange man was so cruel to let her bear the crime and changed her life for the worse before this, but now, he kneeled so easily in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace subconsciously backed away, not wanting to accept his kneeling and apology.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason put one hand around Grace's waist. "What's the matter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I want to get some air outside. This place is making me sick," she said with a pale face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right," he answered and led her out of the meeting room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not until they were out in the open under the trees that Grace took a few deep breaths. She never expected the meeting with the person who framed her to turn out like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew she was coming to see Dexter Rios today and thought about a lot of questions to ask him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the moment she saw the man kneel, she could not ask anything. She was only disgusted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A despicable character like that could trample on the law and ruin someone's life by playing some tricks. However, he wanted her to forgive him after all that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Forgive him? How ridiculous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Just because he kneeled? Just because he apologized? Can you get forgiveness from the victim that way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could that man say this so lightly?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Are you still feeling sick?' asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I feel much better," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haven't you always wanted to meet him? Why were you so anxious to get out just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I only find it ridiculous that he&rsquo;d seek forgiveness from someone he has done so much harm to. How gracious a person needs to be to forgive him!" said Grace.</p></div>
