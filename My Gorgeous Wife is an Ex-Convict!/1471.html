        <h1>Chapter 1470</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "It wasn&rsquo;t coincidental. Lily chose you to be the scapegoat. She had her eyes on Sean, but you were Sean's girlfriend at the time. Making you take the blame was the perfect plan."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace instantly felt her hair standing on end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It turned out Lily wanted to kill two birds with one stone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She was not made the scapegoat by chance; it had all been planned!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace closed her eyes to digest the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Most truths were cruel, but maybe she would face something crueler afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her eyelashes trembled slightly, and her hands tightly gripped the thin blanket that covered her body. After a long time, she opened her eyes and looked at Jason again. "You only helped me reverse my case because you didn&rsquo;t want me to find out the truth, right? So you found Dexter Rios and made me think that was the truth to everything?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's body shook a little, and he slowly walked toward Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The closer he got, the tighter she gripped the sheets. Finally, he stood at the bedside and half-knelt before her. "I'm sorry. I thought it was the best way to close the case."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He never thought he would say sorry so many times!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, these days, he had apologized countless times. When she was awake, and... sound asleep...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why did you lie to me?" She took a deep breath, her voice growing louder. "You didn&rsquo;t have to find the truth and investigate the case for me, but why did you lie to me? Why did you make me think Dexter Rios was the real perpetrator? Why cover up for Lily?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her every question was mercilessly slashing on his chest like the sharpest blade, making him feel so much pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm sorry. I'm sorry..." Jason raised his chin slightly and apologized with a humble gesture. "I was afraid at that time. I was afraid that you would leave me when you found out the truth, but I was also afraid that you'd keep looking into the matter. It was the only way I could give you justice and clear your name!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace smiled wryly and only felt her nose feeling intensely sore. "Is this the way you love someone? Do you love me by deceiving me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, will you forgive me? I'll make Lily go to jail, I&rsquo;ll make the Atkinson family face the law, and I... I can go to prison as well. I can go through what you've been through..." He sobbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, he was no longer Emerald City's Master Reed but a pitiful man begging for her forgiveness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Forgive...' Grace stared blankly at Jason. He was kneeling in front of her with pain and remorse on his face, but... 'How can I ever forgive him? The truth came too late.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was too late and she had already suffered too much. She had even firmly believed the truth he gave her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;But I&rsquo;ve found out now that he knew all about my sufferings! If... I hadn't found him after my release from prison and if he had not fallen in love with me, what would have become of me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's silence made Jason grab her hand in a hurry. His hand was cold and slightly trembling. When he took her hand, it was as if he were clinging desperately to a piece of driftwood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if he could not let go no matter what, and he would drown if he did.</p></div>
