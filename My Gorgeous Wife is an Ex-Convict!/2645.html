        <h1>Chapter 2643</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&rsquo;Wide shoulders, a narrow waist, long legs...' Her mind immediately began to wonder what a comic version of him would look like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He&rsquo;d be... attractive!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more she thought about it, the more excited she was. The embrace that made her flustered at first became natural. Brian's voice rang again. "Done." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's done?" she asked in a daze, still lost in her imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're done now. You don't have to hold me anymore," his elegant voice said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller immediately came to her senses. 'Gosh... I got carried away!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face reddened instantly, and she let go. "Sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I should apologize for hugging you just now," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Was your friend who I just met nearby?&rdquo; Valda Theller was not stupid. She immediately figured out the reason for Brian's sudden intimacy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," he said and released his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is Grace the friend who used to work at the small noodle shop?" she asked suddenly as if a woman's intuition had made her think that the friend was Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He paused slightly, and his dark phoenix eyes looked coldly at her. "There are questions you&rsquo;d better not ask."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Valda Theller only had a feeling that the elegant and indifferent man felt dangerous. It was as if the question was taboo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, perhaps that woman Grace was taboo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Lina drove and said, "I didn't know that Brian has a girlfriend. But Valda Theller doesn't seem like the usual women around Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent as if she was thinking about something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Didn't you always hope that Brian could put aside his childhood feelings for you and start a new relationship?" Lina could not help saying when she saw that her best friend was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;d be nice if they were in a real relationship," murmured Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina mumbled, "What's the matter? Is it fake? It doesn't look fake to me. If it were fake, wouldn&rsquo;t it have been more convincing if Brian found a beautiful actress?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Valda Theller might look cute and friendly, but she was not stunning. If Brian wanted others to believe he was in a relationship, he would have chosen a beautiful woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides, didn't we secretly see Brian intimately embracing his girlfriend when we were in the parking lot earlier? Brian seems to like Valda Theller pretty much," Lina said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope it's just me overthinking," said Grace, but she felt vaguely uneasy. After all, the last time she ran into Brian in the bookstore, Brian had smiled and said...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, I'll get over you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it a coincidence that he found himself a girlfriend so soon? He fell in love with someone right after deciding to get over me. Or...'</p></div>
