        <h1>Chapter 4230 Shouldn't Be Difficult</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you feel uncomfortable? Don't you want to fight for it? Why did you accept it so easily?" Tina suddenly spoke up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler stared motionlessly at the person in front of him. Little did she know that if he truly fought for it, he might not be able to conceal the monster of desire in his heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What would she do when that time comes?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He couldn't predict the consequences, nor could he be certain that he would be able to control his actions rationally in the future.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fight was something she couldn't bear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, he held onto a glimmer of hope: "If I fight for it, what would you do? Would you fall in love with me again? If you still don't love me, then my fight would only bring you pain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's okay!" Tina said without hesitation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Both she and Chandler were stunned after she said those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina pursed her lips. "Chandler, I don't like how you are now, always seeming to consider me but at the same time acting as if it doesn't matter whether I love you or not. It's like your life can go on as usual even if I don't love you, and even if I fall in love with someone else, you remain unruffled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler forced a bitter smile. Did he really not care? Could life really continue like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For him, it was impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But precisely because she said those words, it only further proved that she had truly forgotten everything between them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, I am not unruffled, and it does matter to me whether you love me or not. If you fall for someone else, I would be jealous! Especially when you wake up and care about Kit, I feel jealous too. This jealousy wraps around my heart like a venomous snake, making me feel like if this continues, I will no longer be myself!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe he would do something extreme to her, lock her up somewhere secluded, make her only focus on him, continuously possess her...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't actually want any of this to happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just wanted her to be able to be happy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let me fall in love with you again!" Tina met Chandler's gaze head-on.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Chandler exclaimed in surprise.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let me fall in love with you again. Even if I can't recover my memory, if I can fall in love with you again, then we can restore our lives to how they were before, right?" Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the various records from the past, she knew that he truly loved her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the past version of herself had also loved him very much. That's why she ended up pregnant with his child. That's why when she lost her memories and everything, she instinctively wanted to protect the baby inside her, regardless of the consequences.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was because deep down in her subconscious, she still loved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You say you want to fall in love with me again?" Chandler's voice sounded hoarse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well, that also depends on whether you can make me fall in love with you again," Tina said, raising her hand to stroke Chandler's cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's body suddenly trembled, but he didn't dodge. Instead, he allowed Tina to continue caressing his face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina stared at the person in front of her, feeling that at this moment, her actions were so natural as if she had done them countless times before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like she had done in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Eugenia said you were so handsome, with such a great figure. When I was in college, many girls liked you. If it wasn't for your single-minded devotion to me, I'm afraid many girls would have made a move on you long ago!" Tina said, suddenly smiling. "And when I think about how good you are to me, and how you're the father of our child, it shouldn't be too difficult for me to fall in love with you again."</span></p></div>
