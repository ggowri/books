        <h1>Chapter 703</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;m just worried that there&rsquo;s something really fishy about Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Perhaps it&rsquo;s as I suspect?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However... What if it's true?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If it's true, then my relationship with Brian will no longer be the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Even if I can just regard Brian as an ordinary person and consider him, at most, a childhood friend who shared a common experience with me when I was little... What about Brian? What would he think?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What about Jay? What would his reaction be?' Having spent time together, Grace had gradually discovered that he could be emotionally sensitive and suspicious. Perhaps it was because of his experiences as a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been concerned about Brian before, and if her suspicions were proven, she was worried about what he would think.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the idea of going to see a psychiatrist made Grace even more hesitant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the bathroom door opened and Jason walked out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was wearing a bathrobe with the collar slightly opened. His chest was partly hidden and partly visible. His two long legs were hidden beneath the bathrobe. His hair was a little wet, and his bangs were all over his forehead, not brushed back as usual. There was an ineffable air of lethargy about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace quickly put the note away in a drawer, then stood up and walked over to Jason. "You're done with your shower?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. What were you looking at?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing," she said. Taking the towel from his hand and changing the subject, she said to him, "Bend down a little. I'll help you dry your hair so it'll dry faster."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes glistened a little, then he smiled softly and said, "Sure." As he spoke, he stooped down to make his eyes level with hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace put a towel over Jason's head and began to dry his wet hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those bright amorous eyes stared at her from behind his bangs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way he looked reminded Grace of the time she had first taken him back to her rented house. After he had washed his head, she dried his wet hair in the same way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then, the way he looked at her was full of icy indifference. Now, it was full of gentleness and... Intense desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help being a little distracted. She only felt as though she was about to lose herself in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace," muttered Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately came back to her senses, her face gradually turning red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some people had the special ability to move others and make them unable to help themselves with just their eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'll go take a shower!" said Grace as she shoveled the towel in her hands into Jason's. Then, she hurried into the bathroom with a change of clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only when the bathroom door closed that Jason's eyes changed slightly. He casually put the towel in his hand on the cabinet beside him, walked to where Grace had been sitting earlier, and pulled the drawer open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the drawer, a piece of note lay quietly in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason picked up the note and looked down at the doctor's name and contact information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was she... Looking at this just now? Is she going to see the psychiatrist and use hypnosis to restore her memory?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, he knew exactly what she had said to the doctor at the hospital that day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If she does use hypnosis to restore the memory associated with Brian&hellip;' Jason's eyes darkened at the thought of it, and his body was filled with a feeling that even he could not describe.</p></div>
