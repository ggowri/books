        <h1>Chapter 3026</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at her appearance, he finds her quite cute, almost like a fan chasing after a celebrity, except that the "celebrity" she's chasing after is a cartoonist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When I meet them, I'll see if I can ask for their autographs, especially from some of the senior artists. I grew up reading their comics, and I never thought that one day I would be able to communicate with them face to face. I wonder if in the future, I can also create such great works like them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, there was a passion for her career in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In his eyes, she looks very beautiful just the way she is!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I will, definitely!" said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the day they were leaving for Deer Capital, when the two of them arrived at the airport, Brian upgraded Valda's ticket to first class. It was Valda's first time flying in first class.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And she didn't refuse Brian's kindness because she knew he wanted her journey to be more comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you been to Deer Capital before?" Valda asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've been there," said Brian. "At that time, I stayed in Deer Capital for a while because I helped Grace with something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get things done? What kind of things?" Valda became even more curious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So Brian told Valda about Amber Mitchell's situation. After all, it was big news in Deer Capital and anyone could find out with a little research.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was shocked to hear that a mentally stable and healthy woman was sent to a mental hospital by her family and endured so much suffering, yet still managed to survive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If Kyla hadn't gone to find Amber, what would have happened to her?" Valda asked with teary eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Perhaps she would have been locked up until death, but luckily the situation was resolved in the end," Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank goodness Kyla kept looking for Amber, and with the help of Grace and you," Valda said. "Is Amber still in Deer Capital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, as far as I know, she's living in Emerald City and still in contact with Kyla and Grace," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope I can be friends with Amber if I have the chance in the future," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After hearing Amber's story, she realized how lucky she was to have someone she loved who treated her kindly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meanwhile, the man Amber loved didn't trust her at all and only had suspicion and doubt towards her, even when she was in trouble and being framed by her family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There will be a chance," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian!" Valda said seriously, "Let's not have any misunderstandings between us in the future! If there are any doubts, let's just ask each other directly. I don't want our relationship to be destroyed by suspicion or anything like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Brian replied seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda finally smiled in relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, lie down for a while and rest. We still have over an hour until we reach Deer Capital," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda nodded and obediently lay down on her seat to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian gently covered her with a thin blanket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he watched Valda close her eyes and fall into a light sleep, his eyes were full of tenderness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This woman was someone he would protect for the rest of his life. He wouldn't make the same mistake as George Gregory did. He wouldn't let their relationship end up like George and Amber's, where there was no chance of turning back!</p></div>
