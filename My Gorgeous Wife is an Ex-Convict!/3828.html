        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"In the future, I will love you even more. I will fill all your anxieties, so don't worry, Mason. Just let me love you well!" She said, and with the fall of her voice, she kissed him on her own initiative.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The gentle kiss, although just a light touch of lips, conveyed a sense of care and focus.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As if he was a precious baby that she needed to take care of carefully.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason endured the kiss without moving, and all the struggles in his eyes eventually turned into a decision.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He slowly closed his eyes, as if to concentrate his senses on her kiss and experience her feelings for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the kiss ended, her voice rang in his ears, "Mason, trust me one more time. I will use all my efforts to love you. Our future will definitely be happy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to be with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he came to her house at the age of three, she wanted to be with him. She wanted to protect him well, give him a lot of love, and make his facial expressions more varied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body trembled slightly, and he slowly opened his eyes, "Veronica, you're not allowed to lie to me!" This sentence sounded like a threat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't lie to you. Everything I'm saying now is true," Veronica said, "Or should I kiss you again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, she kissed his lips again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It feels so good to kiss him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she thought in her mind that between them, the storm will pass and the sun will shine again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jasper came to the ward on the second day, he clearly felt that the atmosphere was different from before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially when Veronica fed Mason the fruit cut by the caregiver, Mason obediently opened his mouth and ate the fruit fed by Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was shocked!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she leaned over to Veronica's ear and whispered, "You didn't really do anything with my second brother, did you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica blushed, but still told Jasper, "Mason and I have reconciled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow!" Jasper immediately showed a happy expression and looked at Mason, "That's great, Mason, you and Veronica won't break up again?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason glanced at Veronica before saying to Jasper, "We won't break up again in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica understood that this statement was not only for Jasper, but also for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There would never be any more breakups between them in the future!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After getting a definite answer, Jasper happily said, "Great, then you won't go abroad, will you? Will you continue your studies </span><span>here</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Mason replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, he wanted to go abroad to stop thinking about Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now that he has decided to be with her, he naturally won't go abroad anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When do you plan to get married? Will you get married after graduation?" Jasper asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica almost choked on her own saliva, "Marriage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you plan on marrying Mason?" Jasper asked with a puzzled expression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Mason asked the same question.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you plan on marrying me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the almost synchronized question from the siblings in front of her, Veronica didn't know how to answer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, she stuttered, "If we get married, wouldn't it be too early?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Seems a bit early," Jasper thought for a moment. Veronica is only two years older than her, and if she gets married after graduating from college, she would only be 22 years old.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she planned to marry William after graduation, according to the average age of marriage, getting married at this age for women is a bit early.</span></p></div>
