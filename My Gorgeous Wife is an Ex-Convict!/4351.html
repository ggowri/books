        <h1>Chapter 4349 Willing to Let Go</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley was stunned, "Really?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I agree to break off the engagement. The official date for the termination of the engagement will be communicated to the Hart family by the Quentin family in due course," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley pursed her lips slightly, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you?" Lornell raised an eyebrow. "What are you thanking me for? For agreeing to break off the engagement? The Quentin family isn't at a loss. On the contrary, it's the Hart family that's going to pay a hefty price."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for agreeing to peacefully break off our engagement, and for saving me all those years ago," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need to thank me," Lornell said. "I told you, breaking off the engagement comes at a cost to the Hart family, not me. As for saving you back then, it was merely out of curiosity."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if it was out of curiosity, it was your curiosity that saved me. If you hadn't asked the Quentin family to rescue me, I might not be alive today, Lornell. Thank you!" Harley said sincerely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell stared at the woman before him, listening as she continued, "Over the years, falling for you, loving you, I have no regrets. It was you who saved me, and you who made me understand what it feels like to love someone. The only regret is that I couldn't make you fall in love with me. I hope in the future you can truly meet a woman you can love, and I wish you happiness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The corners of Harley's lips lifted in a slight curve, a smile as refreshing as a spring breeze. It was as if she was telling everyone that she had truly let go!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell was a bit dazed. Could he really meet a woman he could fall in love with?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> from now on, he and Harley would just be two people with no special relationship. Would he really not regret this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, he suddenly felt a sense of doubt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Quentin family and the Hart family didn't make a public announcement about calling off their engagement, word still got around in their social circles.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You really called off the engagement?" Karen looked at Harley in disbelief after hearing the news.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She thought Harley would get married right after graduation, but he actually called off the engagement!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," Harley replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But didn't you like Lornell? Could it be that Lornell has another woman, so the Quentin family is..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, that's not it," Harley said, "He doesn't have another woman. We're calling off the engagement simply because we feel we're not right for each other."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not suitable?" Karen asked curiously, "You two are a good match in terms of social status, what's not suitable about that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the Quentin family was a member of the Crypt families, not many people were aware of this fact.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the Snee family was also part of the upper crust in Emerald City, so they knew a thing or two about the Quentin family's affairs.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Does being from the same social class guarantee compatibility?" Harley said with a laugh. "Don't you think that sharing the same values and loving each other is what truly defines </span><span>compatibility?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen touched her nose, "Would you really be able to let go?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Karen had always been a witness to Harley's fondness for Lornell.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's not right, no matter how hard it is, you have to let it go," Harley said. Rather than being unhappy for a lifetime, it's better to endure a brief pain now, so you can move on from this situation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen exclaimed, "Let's have a good meal together tonight, I'll keep you company!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm afraid you'll have to take me out for dinner some other time, I have plans tonight," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"An appointment?" Karen was taken aback, "Who is it?"</span></p></div>
