        <h1>Chapter 3251</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And today, she even lifted the hypnosis for him herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin slowly reached out his hand and pulled Kyla into his embrace. His movements were slow, but when he held her, it was with great force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's like wanting to embed her deeply into one's own body, not letting her escape even a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Kyla, this is my last...time trusting you. I trust that you truly love me! I trust that you won't leave me again!" He whispered, burying his face almost entirely in the crook of her shoulder. "You chose to use hypnosis on me, so you have to take responsibility for it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla was stunned and for a moment, she couldn't quite regain her composure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So... he believes her now? And... he's willing to continue being with her?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you not feel angry or resentful towards me?" she asked with a trembling voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What does anger or hatred matter? I know what's most important to me! Just like you said, the only person I've ever loved in my life is you!" Martin said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All the pain he had ever experienced couldn't compare to the love he had for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he loves her, he can let go of those things!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla leaned against Martin's embrace, even though her bones were aching from being held so tightly, she couldn't bring herself to cry out in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because she knew that if she cried out in pain, he would surely let go of her, but she still wanted him to hold her a little longer and make the embrace last a bit longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her hands wrapped around his waist, and at the same time, she hugged him back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Martin, thank you, and... I love you," murmured Kyla as tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had previously prepared for the worst, but now, nothing has happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is the best outcome, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin looked up and gazed at Kyla. "I remember now. From now on, you can't not love me! When it comes to loving me, you have to follow through with your words!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I understand!" She smiled through her tears and took the initiative to kiss his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kiss was completely different from before, it was a kind of unprecedented ease. It was as if all the past worries and fears had finally settled, and there was no longer that feeling of walking on thin ice. Instead, it was a solid and grounded feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He parted his lips slightly, turning from passive to active, responding fiercely to her kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She is the woman he loves the most in his entire life, to the extent that he is willing to give up everything for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And when those buried emotions resurfaced, her feelings towards him seemed to become even more intense, more passionate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a romantic encounter, Martin looked at Kyla sleeping soundly next to him. He gently stroked her hair and then leaned down to lovingly kiss her forehead. He whispered softly, "Kyla, you are mine for the rest of my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Since Martin released the hypnosis, Kyla and Martin's relationship has become even better, and Kyla's face has also gained many more smiles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did something good happen?" Amber asked curiously while she was out shopping with Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, that's a good thing," Kyla smiled and said, "Martin and I have finally truly started over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber paused for a moment, looked at her friend, and then said thoughtfully, "So you have no more emotional baggage?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No more," Kyla said. "From now on, he and I will truly be together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Congratulations!" Amber sincerely congratulated, "After so many years with him, you have finally weathered the storm and come out the other side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you," Kyla said. "How about we all get together this weekend? I'll invite Grace, Lina, and Valda."</p></div>
