        <h1>Chapter 3454</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt a bit suffocated in the mediation room, so she made an excuse to go to the restroom and temporarily left the mediation room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After she walked out, she unexpectedly saw that the door of another mediation room was half open. Inside the room, the old Mr. Cross was saying to Daniel, "You must break up, and break up immediately! Even if this girl is really a good girl as you say, who can bear such a family? Moreover, her family looks down on you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These words, falling into Veronica's ears, were so harsh.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she knew that all of this was caused by her own family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She walked over to the chairs in the hallway and sat down, feeling extremely exhausted. Will she really break up with Daniel? They both felt good about each other, but they were breaking up because of their families.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had only seen this kind of plot in TV dramas before, but she never thought that one day it would happen to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica lowered her head, her eyes filled with bitterness, as if tears were about to burst out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a shadow fell over her, followed by a pair of sneakers that caught her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These were... Mason's sneakers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked up in surprise and saw Mason standing in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Little... Mason..." Her nose felt sour and tears streamed down her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason crouched down and gently wiped away the tears on Veronica's face. "It's okay, Veronica. I'm here. No matter what happens, I'll be by your side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter what happens?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was stunned. Just a moment ago, her heart was lost and confused, but upon seeing Mason, she inexplicably felt at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wiped away her tears little by little and asked suddenly, "What are Veronica's plans?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's the plan?" Veronica asked anxiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you planning to break up with Mr. Cross?" asked Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica murmured, "I...I don't want to break up, but I don't know what to do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What will happen between her and Daniel now that the two families have already had such a big fight?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason's eyelashes trembled slightly, and he lowered his gaze, hiding the fleeting sadness in his eyes. "Is that so? Then let's not break up," he said in a soft voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Veronica stared at the person in front of her, feeling a bit confused and unable to react for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I said, let's just not break up," Mason said. "If Veronica doesn't want to break up, then let's not break up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll take care of it for Veronica," Mason said, standing up and walking towards the mediation room on the Barlow family's side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica quickly followed along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as Archer and Rosalind saw Mason come in, their expressions changed. Archer seemed to be showing loyalty and said, "Mason, I will break up with Veronica and that guy. Please don't mind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, Mason, when are you moving back in? Veronica really misses you, and our whole family wants you back," Rosalind added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason gave a cold glance at the Barlow couple, causing them to immediately shut their mouths.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Mason grew older, the Barlow couple felt more and more pressure every time they were coldly stared at by him. It was as if they were being seen through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He is clearly in front of them, but he is still just a young boy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since Veronica wants to date Daniel, let them date without forcing them to break up," Mason spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Barlow couple were stunned when they heard the news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer was even more surprised and said, "Mason... Are you saying that you want them to continue dating?"</p></div>
