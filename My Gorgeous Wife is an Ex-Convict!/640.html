        <h1>Chapter 639</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly rinsed her mouth, then looked at him with her blushing face. "Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I'm lying?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hesitated, trying to remember what happened in the bar yesterday. 'Oh yes, the strange woman seemed to be interested in him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Then, I got angry because I didn't like other women coveting him like that, so I&hellip; Um... Well, I can&rsquo;t remember, but it didn't seem like he&rsquo;s making it up.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was afraid she had really done all that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm happy, though. It was such a rare sight for me to see you so domineering yesterday. I loved the way you announced to other women that I'm yours," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The corners of his mouth curved upward, even his pretty eyes smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at his smile, suddenly feeling less embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After washing up, Grace had some hangover soup and felt a bit more comfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After breakfast, Jason turned to Grace and said, "By the way, I'll ask Terrence to show you wedding dresses by a couple of designers today. You can have a look and see which designer's style you like most."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace almost choked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When other people get married, they choose the wedding dress, but I... Choose the designer first?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only when Terrence arrived in the afternoon with booklets that Grace discovered that the designers were all top designers in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ordinary people had a hard time getting their clothes, let alone getting them to design their wedding dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But I'm free to choose whichever designer to design my wedding dress?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The booklets contained wedding dresses and gowns designed by these designers, and each could be said to be a masterpiece.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no hurry. You can take your time and let me know when you've made your decision, Miss Cummins. Or, if you want to talk to the designer, you can let me know and I can arrange it," Terrence said with a calm expression, but in fact, he was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never thought Young Master Reed would actually decide to get married!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He&rsquo;s going to marry Grace!' Although, he already knew that Young Master Reed was now working on reversing Grace's case. This meant that when Grace and Young Master Reed got married, she would not be someone with a criminal record.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Grace was no match for Young Master Reed in all aspects, including her family, career, and financial resources.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Will the old man agree to such a marriage?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Knowing that Young Master Reed was meeting Old Master Reed in the hospital right now, Terrence could not help feeling a little worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Jason's private secretary, of course Terrence knew how much Jason cared about Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the first time Terrence saw his boss being so attentive to a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he knew Young Master Reed might marry Grace sooner or later, he did not expect it to happen so soon!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if... He was afraid of someone taking her away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, in the VIP ward, Jason was looking at Old Master Reed who was sitting on the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked older than he was the last time he had seen him. He was old and ailing like a candle guttering in the wind, seemingly ready to leave the world at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He used to look up at the old man and feared him. He would constantly absorb what he wanted him to learn to prove that he was worthy of existing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had no value, then he would be abandoned at any time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he was the old man's only grandchild, half of the blood in his body was abhorred by the old man!</p></div>
