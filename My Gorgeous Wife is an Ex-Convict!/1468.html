        <h1>Chapter 1467</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It had been a bolt from the blue, and it hurt her like hell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she could not let herself suffer for the sake of her health and the babies in her belly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace turned on her phone, logged into her email account, and looked at the email Brian had just sent her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed had probably sent it to Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, what Old Master Reed had said when he saw her before he died flashed through her mind...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then... let's make a bet... and see if you... really love Jason that much..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is this the truth... Old Master Reed mentioned betting on? He wanted to use the truth to see if I truly love Jay!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed had given Brian the truth. If things turned out as Brian had planned, then maybe the truth would never have been exposed to her and she would never have found out about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps she would have been much happier. However, at the same time, she would have gone through life not knowing who it was who had really framed her and nearly ruined her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What on earth caused her to suffer all this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Should she muddle through life or live it while sober?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps there would never be an accurate answer. Everyone's choice would be different. It could be right or wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she would rather live this life in pain but with awareness than being kept in the dark without knowing anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She opened the email and read it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The email was very detailed. It included all the details of her case, clearly identifying the perpetrator as Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily had tampered with the accident, and Dexter Rios was naturally in the know. Therefore, the Atkinson family had immediately sent him abroad after the accident happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'When I reversed my case, Dexter Rios never said Lily was the perpetrator behind the case. Was it because Dexter Rios was loyal to the Atkinson family, so he deliberately kept it a secret?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Or maybe... Jay never had the intention of letting Dexter Rios expose this fact. Because once he exposed Lily, then the Atkinson family might expose their tunneling with the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'The Atkinson family, Lily!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace just found it ridiculous and hateful. The Atkinson family made her take the blame for the sisters' feud!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Lily is the murderer but she appears in front of me as the victim's sister and treats me so cruelly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'And Jay knew about it all along. He knows who the murderer is, but... he hid it from me with the Atkinson family!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace felt another throb of pain in her heart at the thought of it. She quickly put down the phone to calm herself down and did not think about it for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The more she thought about it, the more painful it would be!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She looked down and gently stroked her big belly. "I'm sorry, I scared you... today. I'll be strong. I'll definitely be strong. You should be good too. Let's... wait for another month. Come out after another month, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she had no idea what would happen to her and Jay a month later. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not even know what to think of him now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At night, Grace had fallen asleep in the ward. The ward door was gently pushed open, and Jason walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Only when she was asleep did he dare to come in and see her.</p></div>
