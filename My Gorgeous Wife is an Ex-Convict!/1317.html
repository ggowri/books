        <h1>Chapter 1316</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was a little shocked when he heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla said she wants Nelson to have a bright future and doesn&rsquo;t want Nelson to get involved in the adults&rsquo; conflicts. But it's not like she hasn&rsquo;t had these problems before. Kyla had no intention of giving up custody back then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had a feeling that something had happened to change Kyla Corbyn's mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Martin Weiss was going to marry Paisley Daniels. How could Kyla possibly let the woman who had framed her raise her child?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But she isn't wrong in making such a decision. In terms of benefits, it's better for the child to stay with Martin Weiss than her. Besides, she has little chance of winning the case," Jason analyzed the situation and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We can't jump to conclusions until the end of the case. Besides, aren't you helping me find the attending doctor? Perhaps everything will be clear once we find them! No, I'm going to look for Kyla!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "It's late! Besides, she should be setting up her food stall right now, so she probably doesn't have time to chat with you. You might as well see her tomorrow during the day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After thinking about it, Grace nodded and said. "Okay. I'll go to Kyla tomorrow and find out what's going on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla Corbyn was not running her business in front of the food stall as usual but had come to the hotel where Martin Weiss was staying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn smiled bitterly as she tugged at the hem of her clothes with her hands that were by her sides. She looked at the building of the magnificent luxury hotel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Haven't I already thought this through long before I came? Why would I step back now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I just... I&rsquo;m making the right choice!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, Kyla Corbyn moved her feet and walked straight into the hotel. She went to the reception desk in the lobby. "I want to see Mr. Martin Weiss. Please tell him that Kyla Corbyn is here for him and is willing to accept his request."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The staff at the reception desk heard what she said and replied, "Just a moment, please." Then, they dialed the internal line. Moments later, they turned to Kyla Corbyn and said, "Excuse me, Miss Corbyn, Mr. Weiss would like to see you. You can take the elevator over there..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn took the elevator and came to the door of Martin Weiss's room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once she walked into the room, everything... would be settled!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She never thought she would make such a decision one day. She thought she would fight for custody with Martin Weiss even if it cost her her life, but... The tip of Kyla Corbyn's nose suddenly felt sore, and her eyes became watery.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She abruptly stopped her urge to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was nothing to cry over. Tears were the most worthless thing for her nowadays. Her life had already turned out like this, and all she wanted now was for Nelson to be okay! She wanted him to grow up safe and sound&hellip; And have a... good life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was the only small thing she could do for Nelson!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn raised her hand and rang the doorbell twice. Moments later, the door opened and Martin Weiss appeared in her sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss only gave her a faint glance before turning around and walking inside. Kyla Corbyn bit her lip slightly before following him into the room and closing the door.</p></div>
