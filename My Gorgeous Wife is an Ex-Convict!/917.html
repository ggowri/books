        <h1>Chapter 916</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him in astonishment. "Are you moving here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there something wrong? Didn't we live together before?" he asked, half amused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could it be the same?' Grace pressed her thin lips together. For a moment, she did not know how to answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Or is that you just don't want to live with me, Sis?" he asked as he lowered his face close to her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His breath was on her face. His face that was a masterpiece by God was so close to her that she could make out his eyelashes and their fluttering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Subconsciously, she wanted to turn away to avoid his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the next moment, his fingers grabbed her chin to force her to look at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Is it difficult to answer?" His voice was cold, and his black eyes stared at her with a keen light that seemed to see through her. "Are you regretting it? Are you regretting that you agreed for Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&hellip; won't regret it. It's just that I can't get used to the changes... as quickly as you can. Jason, I want you to give me some time to get used to it again, alright?" Grace said bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice was almost pleading, and there was a twinkle in his eyes." If this is your request, then fine. I can live apart from you for a while to give you time to get used to it, but I don't like waiting too long."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Also, call me Jason." His fingers caressed her red lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her lips... were burning. "Jay..." she called out as he wished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled and put his arms around her. He buried his face deep in her neck and said in a gentle voice, "Finally, you're my sister again. From now on, you'll be good and stay with me. Don't leave me, alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her body was stiff, and she felt a chill all over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was so warm in his arms, but she felt so cold... So cold...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace met Kyla the next day. Kyla had calmed down, but she did not look so good and appeared haggard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you okay?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla forced a smile. "I'm fine. I heard my mother said she called you yesterday and you helped me out." However, at this point, her face changed to worry. "Did you go to Jason for me yesterday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man who came to Martin Weiss claimed to be Jason's private secretary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Come to think of it, only a person like Jason could make Martin Weiss let her and Nelson go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Emerald City was Jason's territory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He didn't ask for anything, did he?" Kyla asked hastily, fearing Grace would suffer for her sake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright. He just wants me to be his sister again," said Grace as she tried to play it down.</p></div>
