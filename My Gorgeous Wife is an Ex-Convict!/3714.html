        <h1>Chapter 3712</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Ha, when did I have a good deal with you?" Crispin said irritably. "Your daughter is quite something. She kept saying she had nothing to do with Mason from the Reed family, but when I tried to take her to the elevator, she hugged him and shouted for help! Is that nothing to do with him? Do you think I'm stupid?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about what happened last night, Crispin felt both scared and disgusted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He thought Veronica and Mason from the Reed family were a thing of the past, but yesterday, Mason had taken Veronica away again. Who knows what kind of relationship they have! If Mason and Veronica had any private contact and he still forced Veronica to be with him, he would be done for!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it weren't for Archer's hint, he wouldn't have been interested in Veronica at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Crispin hated Archer and Rosalind even more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since your Barlow family has the Reed family as a high branch, there's no need for our Clark family to join in. You can go to the Reed family for your business," Crispin made it clear that he wouldn't discuss the deal anymore.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer and Rosalind looked at each other, each with their own suspicions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After leaving Crispin, Rosalind asked Archer, "Does Veronica still have contact with Mason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How would I know? That girl never tells me anything. Besides, if I did know, would I still have to beg the Clark family for business? And even let Veronica entertain Crispin?" Archer replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roselind thought about it and said, "So, Veronica and Mason are still..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's ask that girl. If she really still has contact with Mason, then the Barlow family </span><span>will have a chance to rise again!" Archer exclaimed excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Barlow family used to rely on the Reed family and lived a luxurious life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer had asked his daughter many times to apologize to Mason and see if they could reconcile, but his daughter refused and Mason had been abroad for years and was hard to find.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the evening, when Veronica finished work and returned to her residence, she once again saw her father and stepmother in front of her door.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She frowned, feeling a bad premonition.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Archer put on a fatherly face and said, "Veronica, you have been in contact with Mason again. Why didn't you tell me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was startled. How did her father know?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalind, who was beside her, seemed to sense Veronica's doubts and said quickly, "Veronica, don't deny it. Mr. Ward said that Mason took you away from the hotel yesterday. We didn't see you come back last night and were very worried about you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So it was Crispin who told them!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica breathed a sigh of relief and sneered, "Worried about me? If you were worried, why didn't you call me? You didn't even ask me a single question or look for me, but you say you were worried. Isn't that ridiculous?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Rosalind's face showed embarrassment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't think you need to worry about me. I'm perfectly fine," Veronica added.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So tell me, what's going on between you and Mason? You left the hotel with him yesterday, right? When did you start having contact with him?" Archer impatiently demanded.</span></p></div>
