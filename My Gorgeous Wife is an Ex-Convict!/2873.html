        <h1>Chapter 2871</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly lunged forward, pressed his hand, and said, "Stop drinking. You've had enough drinking for today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked blankly at her. After a moment, his eyes finally focused on her. "Valda..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's me," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly gave a bright yet seemingly sad smile. "How nice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Nice? What's nice?' She was puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect to see you when I'm drunk. Will you say we're not breaking up anymore if I drink more?" Brian said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew he was very drunk when she heard this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would never say such a thing if he were sober. How could a proud man like him say such a thing? "Brian, don't tell me such things even if you&rsquo;re drunk, okay? You know what? You&rsquo;ll give me the wrong impression and make me think you like me when you say things like that," Valda Theller murmured both to him and herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One should never take a drunk person's speech seriously. There would only be more pain if one did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Like... I like you..." He looked at her obsessively. "Valda Theller, I finally made myself fall for you, but you're breaking up with me... You love me&hellip; but you have to break up with me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry, I was wrong to think I could wait until you fell for me," said Valda Theller. She forgot to consider the issue of jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was natural to get jealous when you loved someone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The deeper the love and the more you could not attain it, the deeper the feelings of jealousy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry?" Brian suddenly sneered and staggered to his feet. "Between you and me... Who owes the other an apology?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said nothing because she did not know the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, tell me... you don't want to break up. Tell me that and I... I can give you the right to get back together!" His hands pressed her shoulders as those drunken phoenix eyes of his stared closely at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller felt the urge to cry. If people told the truth after getting drunk, could she fantasize that he liked her more than she thought now that he was saying such words?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... just liking was not enough. The problem between them was that Brian loved Grace too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps this love had deepened over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This love was rooted in his heart, and no one else could change it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how hard she tried, she would be the abandoned one when he had to choose between her and Grace. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The feeling of being given up by the one you loved the most was really... upsetting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We broke up, so I don't need the right to get back together," Valda Theller said darkly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, as though he refused to hear her say that, he only stared at her and said, "Say it. Say you want to get back together! Say it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let me help you to the bedroom. Have a good sleep. You won't feel that way anymore when you wake up," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, you won't. I'm not important enough for you to say that to me," Valda Theller said while taking one of his arms and putting it on her shoulder before helping him toward the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Most of his body weight was on her body. People were especially heavy when they were drunk.</p></div>
