        <h1>Chapter 2327</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What... What the hell is he doing here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'And is he looking through... my phone?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze a little before walking over to retrieve her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss moved his hand away so that her hand caught nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's an invasion of privacy to go through someone else's phone like this," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at the phone and asked, "Why didn't you delete this photo?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The photo displayed on the phone screen was a photo of Martin Weiss and Nelson in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the photo, Martin Weiss was wearing a hospital gown. Although he was pale, he was smiling gently at Nelson while Nelson looked up at Martin Weiss's saline drip with a worried look in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she saw this in the ward, she could not help taking a photo of it and... saving it on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe it was because they had had too few intimate father and son moments like this. It was why the photo was so precious to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just like how Nelson looks here, so&hellip; I didn't delete it," Kyla said as she made something up. In truth, she was just reluctant to delete it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After breaking up with him in the hospital, she could not help wanting to look at his photos. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only then she realized she did not have any photos of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not even see more photos of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Really? I thought you would say it&rsquo;s because you regret it and realize you still have feelings for me. That's why you&rsquo;re reluctant to delete this photo and often look at it. After all, you can only make me feel touched and say yes to your request by saying something like that, no?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. She suddenly felt flustered under his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, what on earth are you trying to say?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He peered at her. The look in his eyes was complex. "Do you regret it now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" She was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;m asking if you regret it now. Do you regret speaking so ruthlessly to me in the hospital that day and stubbornly choosing to dump me? If you hadn't said those words and done those things, I probably wouldn't have chosen to forget our relationship. I would do whatever you wanted. You wouldn&rsquo;t even need to ask me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He got up and approached her as he spoke, "Kyla, do you regret it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His questioning made her panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Do I regret it? Disregarding Mrs. Weiss's request, the choice I made was what I thought was the best solution.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want him to give up everything to love her. She wanted him to be alive and well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the point of asking this now?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">An icy smile appeared on his thin lips. "What if I insist on knowing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His approach only stressed her.</p></div>
