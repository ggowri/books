        <h1>Chapter 723</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after finding Stella Lindsay, he did not give her the dresses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not know why. Just like the little silver bracelet, he did not give it to Stella either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if once he gave them to Stella, then all his years of thinking would come to an end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is... Going on?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For two days, all he could think of was the remark she made the other day when she had a headache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Was that really nonsense?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The red marks on his wrist had faded, but the feeling of being gripped by her hand seemed to linger there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, tell me what's the truth!" murmured Brian as his hands gently wrapped around the long purple dress hanging in the wardrobe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like he was hugging the most intimate lover...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" Grace woke up with a start. What struck her eyes was darkness, but when she touched her forehead, it was all cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been dreaming again. In the dream, the little girl carried the little boy on her back as she walked on the hill. She could even feel the little girl's struggle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the little girl in her dream persevered as if she would not leave the little boy no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Recently, the dreams seemed to happen more and more frequently, and the scenes in the dreams were like playing a movie, changing each time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or is the dream really a forgotten memory?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, as if sensing something was wrong, Grace turned on the bedside lamp and looked over at the space beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jay. Where is he?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked and looked at the time. 'It's already past three o 'clock in the morning. Where will he be at this time?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She got up and went to his original bedroom and study next door, but he was nowhere to be seen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, she went downstairs and still did not see him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had seen his phone on the nightstand on his side of the bed, which meant that he did not have a phone with him right now. She could not get in touch with him even if she wanted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'At this time, he&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Grace remembered the last time she had found him in the mourning hall of Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It was also at midnight!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could he be there again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip slightly, walked quickly out of the main house, and ran toward the mourning hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she got there, sure enough, the light in the mourning hall was on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is he really in there?' thought Grace as the pace of her feet quickened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she reached the front door, she pushed open the door and faced the hall. What her almond-shaped eyes saw was the black and white photo hanging directly above the hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's the photo of Jay's father!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This man's eyes were full of gentleness. He should have had a towering presence, but he ended up freezing to death in the ice and snow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe he just wanted to die.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was abandoned by the woman he loved most, so he lost the will to live.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sympathized with the man, but she also felt a wave of underlying anger.</p></div>
