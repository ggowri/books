        <h1>Chapter 2562</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Staying in a room like this made her feel as if Herman was with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss had asked her what she wanted to do with her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was thinking about taking back her shares in Mitchell Group by legal means before selling them and using the money to engage in archaeology, which she and Herman were both interested in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Herman had planned to go abroad to further his studies in archaeology before returning to the country to make some contributions to the industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In that case, she would fulfill Herman's unfulfilled wishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was one more important thing she could do before that&mdash;helping Simon with his blood transfusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was her child! She gave birth to him, so she had to save his life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Amber Mitchell's phone rang. She picked it up. It was a call from the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is this Miss Amber Mitchell? I'm from the hospital. Can you come to the hospital tomorrow for a comprehensive body check-up for Simon's blood transfusion?" they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Amber Mitchell already did some tests before donating blood to Simon the last time, she needed to undergo a more thorough test for the transfusion this time. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The demand for blood would be much greater than the last time as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, no problem," answered Amber Mitchell. She ended the call after making an appointment with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell went to the hospital the next day. The nurse gave Amber Mitchell a series of confirmation documents and asked her to sign them. Then, she had her blood drawn and an X-ray taken, which was almost tantamount to a full-body check-up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell cooperated without a word of complaint.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the body check-up, Simon's attending doctor called Amber Mitchell to the office for a talk. When Amber Mitchell walked into the office, she also found George Gregory there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory looked much more haggard and thinner than she had seen him a few days before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell only glanced briefly at him before withdrawing her gaze and looking at the doctor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The attending doctor began explaining Simon's current condition and said, "I hope that Simon can have the transfusion as soon as possible. Miss Amber Mitchell, can we do the transfusion the day after tomorrow if there's nothing wrong with your test results?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," Amber Mitchell said without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But it&rsquo;ll be a great strain on your body to donate so much blood at once. After all, this will be different from normal blood donations," the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s alright. I'm mentally prepared," answered Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During the conversation, Amber Mitchell could feel George Gregory's eyes watching her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not want to look at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the doctor finished speaking, Amber Mitchell said, "Alright, I'll be here on time the day after tomorrow. Is there anything else?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The doctor shook his head. "No."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell got up and left the doctor's office, only to hear rapid footsteps behind her as she walked into the hallway.</p></div>
