        <h1>Chapter 4189 The Biggest Lie of a Lifetime</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit looked at Tina in front of him. This time, she didn't look at him with disappointment like before. She wasn't distant anymore, no longer like a gust of wind that he couldn't hold onto no matter how much he tried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the contrary, she was right in front of him, looking at him with eyes that seemed to be grasping onto a life-saving straw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those eyes were filled with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I am... someone who loves you." At this moment, he could finally pour out his love for her so directly and boldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She paused for a moment. "You love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I love you very much." He whispered, raising his hand to gently stroke her messy hair. "Tina, you are the person I love the most. You don't know, but you pulled me out of the abyss little by little. You made me realize that there can be something pure between people, not just manipulation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wouldn't know how he felt when she noticed his efforts and progress on stage, when she looked at him with pure admiration, without the dirty looks he was used to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about me?" Tina asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You really like me... really really like me..." he said. At least, she used to like him a lot for a while, like a fan liking an idol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But later, the things he said and did disappointed her, so she no longer liked him, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he didn't say these words. Even if she regains her memory one day, he wanted to preserve some of the beauty at this moment. He wanted her to think that she only liked him and nothing else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Tina's next words made Kit's whole body stiffen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She said, "So, are you the father of my child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit's pupils suddenly shrank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina hurriedly said, "Did I... did I get it wrong? I'm sorry! Because I always had a feeling that this child in my belly is very important to me, more important than my own life. So I thought, maybe... you are the father of the baby, since you said I really like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kit stared at Tina, an indescribable feeling filling his whole body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He should have denied it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The child in Tina's belly is not his, it's Chandler's! He knows this fact better than anyone else!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at this moment, looking into her eyes, those eyes full of trust in him, he hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His body tensed up, and then he heard his own voice saying, "You... didn't get it wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These few words were almost painfully spoken from his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He's lying! He's lying! He shouted in his mind, not wanting to deceive her! When he rescued her from those villagers, all he thought about was her safety!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he felt even more greedy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You didn't get it wrong, so you..." Tina stammered, looking at the person in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." Kit's lips parted slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stop talking, don't say anything else! A voice in his heart screamed, this lie is not something you can bear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But his voice continued to emerge from his mouth, bit by bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I am the father of the child... I am the father of the child in your belly!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was his lie, the biggest lie of his life!</p></div>
