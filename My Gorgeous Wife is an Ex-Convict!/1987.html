        <h1>Chapter 1985</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The closed car door isolated them from the commotion outside, and the car slowly drove away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was still looking blankly at Hadwin Stephenson. She was in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why are you looking at me like that?" Hadwin Stephenson's voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina then instantly came to her senses. "You didn't have to say that just to silence the reporters. The heir of the Stephenson family... That's too..." For a moment, Lina had no idea how to describe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson smiled. "If your child isn't the heir of the Stephenson family, then whose child should be the heir of the Stephenson family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze. She heard Hadwin Stephenson continue saying, "Lina, you'll forever be the only mother of my children, and the father of your children will only be me. So your child will be the heir of the Stephenson family. This fact will never change."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's eyes could not help watering. Although the man kept refusing to tell her he had &lsquo;forgiven&rsquo; her, he kept showing her how much he loved her and that they were bound to be together with his actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin, falling in love with you is indeed amazing," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson raised his hand to gently wipe Lina's wet eyes. "Alright, stay in the mansion for a few days. You have nothing to worry or think about. I'll take care of everything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay." Her eyes were full of trust for him. Moments later, she added, "But I don't know why Anthony Sherman did this. He doesn't really like me that much. He just likes me a little, but... that affection looks more like friendship to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't think about it if you can&rsquo;t understand it. We'll know after we look into it," Hadwin Stephenson said grimly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'What I'm more curious about is who's behind Anthony Sherman. Is it what I think it is? And...' He stared at her tenderly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In fact... falling in love with her was what was amazing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was stunned when she saw the news about her best friend online. Fortunately, based on the latest related news, Hadwin Stephenson seemed to trust Lina fully and even said that the child in Lina's belly would be the heir of the Stephenson family. That came as a relief to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she still called her best friend. "What happened? Why did Anthony Sherman spread rumors on purpose? He doesn't strike me as someone like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I don't know. I can't get through to him either, but Hadwin said he'll look into it. I'm sure it won't be long before we find out why," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You nearly scared me to death. I was really afraid you and Hadwin Stephenson would have another misunderstanding," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina could not help laughing. "Alright, don't worry. I caused such a big misunderstanding last time. Wouldn&rsquo;t I have learned my lesson this time? If Hadwin really misunderstood, I'd pester him to make things clear. Worst-case scenario, we&rsquo;d do an amniotic fluid test. But Hadwin said he won&rsquo;t misunderstand anything, and I&rsquo;ve already explained it to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Speaking of which, Lina only felt her heart melting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That&rsquo;s good. Just call me if you need me," said Grace.</p></div>
