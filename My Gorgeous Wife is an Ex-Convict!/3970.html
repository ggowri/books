        <h1>Chapter 3968</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary walked into the CEO's office and said to Mick, "Mr. Reed, there's a Miss Irene who wants to see you. She says she's... your sister."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary hesitated when she said the last four words. However, Miss Lynch had spoken with such conviction and even showed a photo of Mr. Reed and her as children, so she came in to report it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick frowned when he heard the name Irene.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This distant name in his memory was almost forgotten.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was his words that allowed the Gregory family mother and daughter to enter the Reed family, and Irene became his adopted sister.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But later, Irene's mother framed his mother, causing the Gregory family mother and daughter to be kicked out of the Reed family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Now, why did Irene suddenly appear? What was her purpose?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't let her in," Mick said. He wasn't interested in whatever Irene's purpose was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Miss Lynch said she wants to talk to Mr. Reed about Nancy and Miss Fowler," the secretary said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick's eyes suddenly darkened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene wants to talk to him about Nancy?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let her in," Mick said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." The secretary stepped back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, Irene walked into the CEO's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene's heart was in turmoil as she looked at Mick sitting behind the desk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once her prince charming, he had grown into a man.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His words had changed her fate, turning her into a princess admired by all. But when the real princess returned, she was cast aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the Reed family kicked her out, she faced countless sneers and ridicule, mocking her delusions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had resented him countless times over the years, wondering why he didn't speak up for her when she was being kicked out. After all, he had wanted her to be his sister!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Despite her resentment, she couldn't help but feel a deep infatuation for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At least she was special to him, the only woman besides his family who had ever been close to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he was dating a woman like Nancy, even going so far as to take down the Schultz family for her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was so charming about Nancy that he would do all this for her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother, it's been a long time," Irene said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not your brother, you don't have to call me that," Mick said coldly and distantly. "How did you find out about Nancy?" After all, he and Nancy were dating and the outside world didn't know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene didn't mind the coldness, or rather, she had expected it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nancy is my colleague, and I also work at the hotel," Irene said. "I saw Nancy get into your car."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you want to tell me about her?" Mick asked, wanting to know what this woman was up to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you with a woman like Nancy?" Irene asked in response. "She's not worthy of you, and she's even scheming. She's with you for a reason!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick sneered, "You're not qualified to say that. If you came here just to say these things, then...get out. Don't appear in front of me again, or I'll make sure you can never set foot in Emerald City!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Irene took out her phone and pressed play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy's voice came out of the phone</span><span>&mdash;</span></p></div>
