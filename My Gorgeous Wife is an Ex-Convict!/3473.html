        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the waiter left the private room, Veronica said, "Mason, I didn't come here with you today to eat. You asked me to clarify why I'm angry, so here it is: I don't like my emotions being treated as a bargaining chip! Even if Daniel was in it for the money, he could easily give up our relationship, but I should be the one to decide whether or not to end it, not have it end like this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her with a puzzled expression, "But isn't the result the same in the end?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, the result is the same, but at least it won't make me feel like a puppet that can be manipulated!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're not, and I've never treated you like a puppet," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what you're doing now is treating me like a puppet, Mason. Do you know that? In my eyes, you seem like a completely different person, someone I don't even recognize!" She murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, are you going to continue like this and stop talking to me?" he asked, staring at her fixedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know," she started, avoiding eye contact with him. "Every time I see you, it reminds me of this thing. I don't even know what else to say to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There's nothing to say, maybe that's just how she feels about him now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do I need to do for you to talk to me again?" he asked. "Do I need to apologize? Just tell me what to do and I'll do it. But please, don't ignore me, don't stop talking to me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her silence and avoidance were unbearable for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you never feel like you've done anything wrong, then you don't need to admit to any mistakes," Veronica said. "As for anything else you need to do... no matter what it is, it's going to be hard for us to go back to the way things were before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Return to the time when we were so close and trusted each other completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is it because I ruined the relationship between you and Daniel?" He raised his hand and held onto her chin, forcing her gaze to meet his. "Then why did Veronica choose Daniel as her boyfriend? If Veronica wants a boyfriend, I can be one too, can't I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let go of me!" She wanted to pull his hand away from her chin, but she couldn't budge it no matter how hard she tried. "What are you talking about? You're my little brother!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not lying!" Mason said, his face getting closer to the person in front of him. "Veronica, let me be your boyfriend. I promise I won't betray your feelings like Daniel did. I'll treat you a thousand times, ten thousand times better than he did. I'll do everything he can do, and even more, and better!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Veronica heard this, she found it ridiculous. "Do you think that being in a relationship is something that can be done with anyone? Do you think that feelings are something that can be controlled and you can just like whoever you want? Mason, saying something like this only proves that you don't understand emotions at all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Mason replied, "How do you know that you can't fall for me? Haven't you always said that you like me the most? If that's the case, why can't we date?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's a different feeling!" Veronica retorted.</p></div>
