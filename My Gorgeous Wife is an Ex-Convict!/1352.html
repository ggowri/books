        <h1>Chapter 1351</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn filled her prescription at the hospital. On their way back, Grace dragged her to the mall, saying she needed Kyla Corbyn&rsquo;s help as she wanted to buy some toys for Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nelson already has a lot of toys. Mr. Harto also gave Nelson some toys before this," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said with a smile, "Kids won't complain about having too many toys. By the way, let's also buy some winter clothes for Nelson later. The weather is getting cold, and it'll be winter soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After picking out the toys, Grace went to the children's clothing floor with Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Grace had paid and was ready to leave with Kyla Corbyn after picking out the clothes, two figures walked into the shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was immediately stunned when she saw the two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What a small world. They did not expect to meet Martin Weiss and Paisley Daniels here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were stunned too. It seemed they did not expect to meet them here either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's gaze fell on Kyla Corbyn's body, and he could not help frowning. She did not look very well today. Her face was dull, and her thin body only wore a coat that did not look very warm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Clothes like that were fine indoors, but they could not protect you from the wind when you were outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Won't this woman put on thicker clothes when she goes out?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What a coincidence. I didn't expect to meet you here." Paisley Daniels grunted and held Martin Weiss's arm more intimately as if declaring her territory. "Although we had some unpleasant encounters earlier, I'm not petty. Besides, Nelson will be my son too. I'm going to buy Nelson some clothes later. Kyla Corbyn, you can take them back. Otherwise, the kid would have no decent clothes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said it as if it was for the child's benefit, but her tone sounded like she was doing some charity work just to condescend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks," Kyla Corbyn said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla Corbyn, I'm being kind&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn interrupted abruptly, "Kind? Paisley Daniels, neither I nor my son need your kindness. I'll hand over Nelson's custody, but he will never be your son!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not let her son call this woman &lsquo;Mom&rsquo;!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Paisley Daniels glared at her. 'If I didn&rsquo;t want to give Martin Weiss a good impression, I would have rushed over to fight her! But... this woman wouldn't live long either!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels thought maliciously, 'As long as this truth is well hidden, then Kyla Corbyn is doomed to die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll be free of worries once Kyla Corbyn is dead!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you had enough? Paisley's only being kind!" snapped Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked up, and her gaze fell on Martin Weiss's face. 'If I... had really saved him in the past, isn't it pathetic that the man I saved is now chiding me for the woman who framed me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her gaze now contained a self-mocking sadness, making Martin Weiss's heart surge with an uncomfortable feeling. Her gaze was pressing his heart like a mountain. It was so heavy that he gasped for breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Is there anything wrong with what I said? Paisley has been so patient with you. What about you? How have you repaid her?" Martin Weiss said coldly, wanting to sweep away the heavy feeling.</p></div>
