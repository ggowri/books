        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the days that followed, Harley carried on as usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Quentin family hadn't responded yet to the matter of breaking off the engagement. However, such things couldn't be rushed. After all, it was a big deal for both families.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was impossible to know what kind of conditions the Quentin family would ultimately propose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And Lornell never reached out to Harley!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley stared at her phone. Lately, not to mention a single call, Lornell hadn't even sent her a text message.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Logically speaking, Lornell should have already known about the Hart family's proposal to call off the engagement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, what was he thinking then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, Harley felt a wave of complex emotions welling up inside her. Could it be that she still hoped Lornell would sit down and have a serious talk with her? Or was she secretly hoping that Lornell would try to keep her around? That he might even like her a little?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, just as this thought flashed through Harley's mind, she couldn't help but laugh at herself sarcastically!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What on earth was she thinking!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since Harley had already mentioned to her parents that she wanted to break off the engagement, she had nothing to think about Lornell anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvert, are you really going to reject me?" A crisp female voice interrupted Harley's daydreaming.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned her head and saw a girl blocking a boy's path. The girl was on the shorter side, but she was dressed in luxurious designer clothes. The boy, on the other hand, was quite tall but was wearing ordinary casual clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I'm not interested in wasting time on dating," the guy replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can you call this a waste of time? I'm serious!" the girl said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" The boy stared at the other person, "So, are you planning to marry me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" The girl was surprised, "Marriage?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, the relationship I want isn't just for fun. Are you planning to marry me?" the guy continued to ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We're still students, marriage seems too far off... and considering your family's circumstances, I'm afraid my family might also..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you're just planning to toy with me, is that it?" The boy revealed a mocking smile.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not a game, I genuinely want to be in a serious relationship with you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If it's just about dating, then isn't that just toying with our feelings? If you're not ready to </span><span>marry me, then don't bother asking me if I want to be with you!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, the girl's face turned even more sour. She stomped her foot and exclaimed, "You're just a lunatic!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After she finished speaking, she turned around and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert slowly lowered his head. From a young age, she wasn't the only girl who had been attracted to his looks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had encountered too many girls like this. They were only attracted to him because of his good looks, wanting to get close to him, to date him. But the moment they got bored or faced any issues, they wouldn't hesitate to kick him to the curb.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He didn't need this kind of cheap sentiment at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you Calvert?" A clear and melodious voice rang out in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert's body suddenly stiffened. This voice had appeared countless times in his dreams.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even without looking up, he could tell who the voice belonged to!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert stared blankly at the figure not far away, and then felt his heart pounding uncontrollably! It was so intense!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His heart felt like it was about to leap out of his throat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss... Miss Hart..." he called out softly.</span></p></div>
