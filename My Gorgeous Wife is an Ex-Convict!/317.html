        <h1>Chapter 316</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked shocked. "What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you not hear me?" Jason repeated with a patient face. "I said, since you don't like that company, I might as well get rid of that company."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked as if he was talking about something very ordinary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, get rid of it?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's pupils constricted suddenly. Could she have understood him wrongly? That company was a rookie in the food delivery industry. Although it was not as good as those well-known companies, it was performing quite well recently. She had also read news reports that the company recently raised another $1.7 billion in capital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could a company like that be rid of so easily? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... If it was Jason, then the impossible would become possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just because I don't like it?" she asked, looking at Jason in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled. &ldquo;I also don't like the people who sell others out. A company leader who wants to gain benefit by selling people out probably can't do much even if I don&rsquo;t get myself involved. In that case, it might as well disappear earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, she felt as if a lot of words seemed to be stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He laughed and talked about the survival of a company in such a simple way that the boss would probably never have made the call if she had known it would turn out like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Right, why aren't you eating any vegetables? Eat," he said, picking up a bunch of vegetables into her bowl with his chopsticks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he was both gentle and caring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she knew it was all an illusion. The others would never guess what this man was thinking. He might be extremely caring to you one second and banish you to hell the next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace kept her head down and ate her food somewhat mechanically. An obviously delicious meal seemed to have no taste.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure you don't want me to find you a job? That way, you can do whatever job you want. You can even go back to your old job," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's... all right. I can find a job myself," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, the air seemed to freeze, and she could feel his eyes on her even if she did not look up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was some time before Grace heard Jason's voice. "All right. If you insist, then you can do whatever you like."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he got up and left the dining room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not until she heard the sound of footsteps receding that Grace took a long breath. She looked up at the dining table. There was still half a bowl of rice in front of where he had been sitting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not even finish his dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did her answer annoy him just now? She could not help thinking about this. Then, she laughed to herself and thought that there was no use thinking about these things. Speaking of annoying him, she must have annoyed him from the very beginning when she refused to stay with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, her fingers were almost healed, but... she could not leave this place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When exactly could she leave?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Somehow it always seemed to her that the longer she stayed there, the deeper the bond between her and him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina woke up, what she saw was the unfamiliar ceiling and the dim crystal lamp hanging from it.</p></div>
