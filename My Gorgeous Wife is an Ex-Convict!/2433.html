        <h1>Chapter 2431</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared at the screen and suddenly said, "If we bring Amber Mitchell out for a psychiatric evaluation and prove that she isn't mentally ill, the Mitchell family's explanation will be useless!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Firstly, we need to confirm that Amber Mitchell isn't mentally ill. Secondly, we need to take Amber Mitchell out of the mansion before the Mitchell family calls the police. The security system is a big problem. Thirdly, it takes some time to prove whether a person is mentally ill. We need to keep the Mitchell family occupied for some time. We can't let the Mitchell family find Amber Mitchell. At least not until we get the test results. Otherwise, the Mitchell family has absolute right to object to the test."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian presented three problems.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath and said, "I think Amber Mitchell... Perhaps it&rsquo;s better to say that she isn&rsquo;t suffering from mental illness exactly. At least, she wasn't mentally ill when she was first sent to the hospital. It's just that after so many years, we&rsquo;re not sure how lucid she is. It&rsquo;s possible that she goes in and out of it intermittently.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to bet on it?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's voice continued to ring in her ears. "If you want to bet on it, I'll do it with you. Even if you lose, I have a way to solve it. It's just going to be a little troublesome, but are you going to feel at ease if you don't take the chance?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not care what would happen to the woman called Amber Mitchell. He just wanted Grace to feel at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt as if he had seen through her. He knew that she would never feel at ease if they did not try to save Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not only because Amber Mitchell was Kyla's friend but also because she had met her. If she ignored Amber Mitchell, she might regret it in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's take a chance." Grace's red lips uttered the words gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smiled. "Okay, let's take a chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if it was nothing. If they lost, it would only be regarded as a scandal where Reed group was being a bully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Jason and Grace, who were looking at each other, Brian felt bitter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This is how Grace is. She has always had a sense of justice. Jason is willing to pay for Grace's sense of justice. At least this proves that Grace didn't choose the wrong person!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then we have to figure out a way to get Amber Mitchell out of the mansion. If we want to hack into the Mitchell family's security system, we need experts to take up the job. That&rsquo;s the only way we can sneak into the mansion and rescue Amber Mitchell," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason turned to look at Mick Reed. "Can you access the security system in the Mitchell family's mansion?" he spoke as if it were a piece of cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can try," the little one said as he took out his mini laptop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned, not expecting Jason to let the little one hack into the Mitchell family's security system.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The computer expert nearby asked in confusion. "Isn't that ridiculous?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hastened to explain on her son's behalf, "He's... quite good at this. He has previously hacked into the Barlow family's security system."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Barlow family?" Brian paused. "The Barlow family Philip Barlow is from?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," Grace said meekly. She still found it unbelievable when she recalled how her son had gotten through the Barlow family's security system and how the two children broke into the Barlow family&rsquo;s house.</p></div>
