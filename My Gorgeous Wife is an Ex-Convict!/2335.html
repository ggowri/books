        <h1>Chapter 2333</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were talking and laughing. There seemed to be a warm atmosphere around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People would probably think they were husband and wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The sight of it made him feel uncomfortable. They were talking and laughing in the video, which made him find the scene harsh on the eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand gripped the phone so tightly that he almost cracked it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla..." He murmured her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she really have no feelings for Chase Harper? Why is she smiling at Chase Harper like this if she doesn't have feelings for him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;She&rsquo;s smiling... so gently!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Kyla and Chase Harper were done shopping, they looked at the time and realized it was almost noon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had lunch at a fast food restaurant on the first floor of the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for buying Nelson a gift," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper said sheepishly, "Why are you thanking me? Didn't you buy Juliet a present too? I just don't know if Nelson will like my gift."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He will," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they were getting up to leave after finishing lunch, Chase Harper suddenly said, "Hey, your shoelace came loose."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked down, and the shoelace on her left sneaker had indeed come loose. She was about to bend over to tie it when Chase Harper said hurriedly, "Hey, no, let me help you tie it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My belly isn't too big yet. It's okay for me to crouch," said Kyla. She was less than five months pregnant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper was about to say something, but he suddenly froze when he saw someone behind Kyla. He just stared blankly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla noticed Chase Harper's strange behavior. "What's wrong?" She turned her head to follow Chase Harper's gaze as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A tall figure came into Kyla's view.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at the figure in shock. 'What is he doing here? This fast food restaurant doesn't look like a place he would normally go to!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides that... Martin Weiss was now walking in her direction!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was even looking at her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla instantly felt her heart shuddering. Is Martin Weiss... here for me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In this short moment, Martin Weiss had already walked up to Kyla. "It seems you're enjoying your date with Mr. Harto. Kyla, I remember you telling me you have no romantic feelings for him not long ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper knew Martin Weiss too. When he saw Martin Weiss, he politely said, "Mr. Weiss, Miss Corbyn is only helping me to choose a gift for my daughter today. I rarely come here, so I don't know what to buy home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You make it sound nicer than it is." Martin Weiss snorted and glanced coldly at Chase Harper. "What will others think of a man and another man's pregnant wife choosing gifts for children? Kyla is legally my wife, and I have no intention of being cuckolded."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss asked as he looked at Kyla again, "Or are you going to cuckold me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Something dangerous flickered in those dark eyes. Kyla instantly trembled. Her blood seemed to be freezing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss seemed so dangerous right now. It was as if as long as they said the wrong thing, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brother... Chase and I are just friends. We happened to run into each other in tMason Swansonty, and we&rsquo;re only picking out gifts together. We&rsquo;ve done nothing that crossed the boundaries of being friends,&rdquo; said Kyla. </p></div>
