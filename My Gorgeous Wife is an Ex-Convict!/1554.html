        <h1>Chapter 1552</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Also, I don't even know this uncle. Why would he be happy to see me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian gently touched the little one's head. Then, he straightened up again. Those dark phoenix eyes gazed intently at Grace. "You're still alive, but why haven't I heard from you in these five years? Do you know how devastating it was when I thought you were dead and saw the Reed family give you a funeral?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had even gone to the ocean she fell into, thinking of jumping in to be with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "I'm sorry I made you worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian's Adam's apple bobbed. His eyes that were looking at Grace were now red. "It's good that you're alive. It's good that you're alive..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As he spoke, he unconsciously wanted to raise his hand to touch her to make sure that she was alive and she was not just an illusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, before his hand touched her, she already backed away slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His expression changed a little. He saw the rejection in her eyes and instantly only tasted the bitterness in his mouth. "Is it because of Jason?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes." Without hesitation, she replied, "I'm Jay's wife, and he's also the one I love the most."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian suddenly laughed, but his laughter sounded a little sad. "It's been five years and there was no news from you in those five years. You never even come back. Do you really love him? If you love him, why didn't you come back earlier?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace took a deep breath and said, "I have my reasons, but no matter how many years have passed, I&rsquo;ll still love him and always return to him. Brian, it's been five years. You shouldn't continue wasting your time on me. It's not worth it, and it's unnecessary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A touch of pain flitted across those phoenix eyes. "It's not up to you to decide if it's worth it. I know better than anyone whether it's necessary."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace knew that the man before her had always been persistent. Otherwise, he would not have looked for her for so many years just because of a promise he made when he was a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Even if you keep persisting, it's not going to change anything. Jay is the only one I love!" With that said, Grace took her daughter's hand and tried to bypass Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian stood where he was. 'Jason is... the only one she loves?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Does she know she's the only one I love?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian suddenly rushed over and grabbed Grace's other arm, stopping her from leaving. "Do you love him? Do you know if he loves you? Do you know that he said to my face he doesn&rsquo;t love you anymore?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace's expression changed slightly as she subconsciously covered her daughter's ears. She did not want the child to hear these. "Brian, stop. My answer won't change no matter what you say..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, he doesn't love you. Even if you're back now, do you think he's going to feel the same way about you? If only... I hadn&rsquo;t misunderstood you and if I hadn't pushed you to him, you wouldn't have fallen into the ocean and disappeared for five years..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian started sobbing. He stared intently at the person before him. "Do you know how much I missed you? Do you know what I've been through all these years? If he doesn't love you, why do you want to stay with him? Is it because of the children..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Stop talking about it. I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before Grace finished speaking, another voice suddenly rang out. "Brian, since when do you have the right to interfere in the Reed family&rsquo;s affairs?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace instantly froze and turned her head to look in the direction of the sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She only saw that a black Bentley had pulled up next to them at some point and Jason was standing in front of it, looking coldly at them.</p></div>
