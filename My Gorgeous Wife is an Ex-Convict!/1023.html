        <h1>Chapter 1022</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked around. There were many similar food stalls around, and the traffic in the area was pretty good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You two haven't had your dinner yet. I'll make you some fried vermicelli. You can try out my cooking," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure!" Lina said with a smile. Speaking of which, she had not tried her cooking yet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you? I don't think you've had dinner either," said Grace as she looked at Kyla Corbyn with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll just eat something later. I own a food stall. Would I starve myself?" Kyla Corbyn said with a smile and quickly cooked two plates of fried vermicelli for Grace and Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They ate at a small square table. Lina praised Kyla Corbyn's cooking while she ate. "It's much better than my mom's cooking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does your mom still cook at home?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's right. My mom's cooking hasn't improved in decades, but she loves to occupy the kitchen. Then my dad would always butter up my mom by telling her how good her cooking is, so she doesn't even know the true quality of her cooking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Speaking of this, Lina could not help wanting to complain. Half of her mom's &lsquo;ignorance&rsquo; was due to her dad's indulgence. Sometimes, her father would give the excuse of letting her mom rest when he could not stand her cooking and cook himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That means your dad loves your mom a lot!" said Grace. She envied such relationships. Although it was ordinary and there were no exciting plot twists, there was warmth in every detail of their life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hoped she would have a relationship like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it had become wishful thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's true. They&rsquo;re very much in love." Then, Lina shrugged and asked, "By the way, how have you been with Jason? Does he still insist on playing the brother and sister game with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had a flashback of the night he talked about getting back together. He said he would love her and wanted her to love him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After she turned him down, he did not come to her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, after she turned him down, the look of loneliness in his eyes had burned into her mind like an imprint. The image would flash through her mind when she closed her eyes in the dead of night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Did Jason do something again?" Lina immediately panicked because of her best friend's silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, he just..." Before Grace could answer, Lina's phone suddenly rang. Lina looked at the caller ID and realized it was from Hadwin Stephenson, so she answered it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are you? Are you still at Kyla Corbyn's house? Do you want me to come and get you?" asked Hadwin Stephenson, knowing that she had gone to Kyla Corbyn's residence with Grace today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not there anymore. Kyla sets up a food stall at Huaihai Road at night. Grace and I followed her here. I drove today, so you don't need to come and get me. I'll go home after sending Grace home. I'll contact you once I'm home," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," answered Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was about to end the call when suddenly, there was a bang and someone kicked over a chair at the table next to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked up and saw three men sitting at the table next to them. They each wore menacing expressions. One of them spat out the words, "What kind of crap are you charging me for? Damn it. There are flies in your food. Are you trying to kill us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other two men were also blabbering something about Kyla Corbyn being a shady stall owner, compensation, and so on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These three men were only here to create trouble!</p></div>
