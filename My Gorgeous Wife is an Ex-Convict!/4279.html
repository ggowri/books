Chandler!" she shouted, struggling to push him away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he held on too tightly, and she couldn't push him away at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina... Tina..." he kept softly calling her name, "I'm in pain... Tina... I'm in so much pain..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Pain? Tina instantly understood, seeing his appearance just now, he looked very distressed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let go of me first, I'll take you to the hospital right away!" Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Chandler didn't loosen his grip, instead, he held Tina even tighter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Low, hoarse roars kept entering her ears from his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Tina could finish her sentence, his lips heavily landed on hers, silencing the words she hadn't finished saying.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina froze, instinctively wanting to turn her head and avoid this kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But his lips firmly held onto hers, swirling and sucking, deepening the kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She didn't know how long he had been kissing her, only feeling his breath enveloping her entire body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she felt like she was suffocating, his lips finally left hers. She gasped for air, and his lips trailed down her neck, sucking on her neck and collarbone...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Tina felt his hands tearing at her clothes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No, she couldn't let this happen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If this continued, it would...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A sense of instinctual panic spread through her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No!" she yelled, struggling even harder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her feeble resistance was too weak in front of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Right now, he was like a wild beast. No matter how she screamed or struggled, he remained indifferent, following his instincts to possess and claim her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because only then could he feel less pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Not enough... he wanted more...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only this thought occupied Chandler's mind.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The pain had driven him completely insane.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This pain was like being trapped in a desert of flames, no matter how he struggled, he couldn't escape. His whole body burned as if every drop of blood was evaporating.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly, it was as if a source of water appeared, so comforting that it made his soul tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The body's instinct drove him to desperately reach for this source of water, to want more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But suddenly, there were faint cries, faintly reaching him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Crying... who was crying?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why did these cries make him feel so unbearable? It was suffocating, even more than the pain of being engulfed in flames.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Stop crying, please stop crying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He kept shouting in his mind. The suffocating feeling was like waves of cold air, constantly sweeping over him, briefly awakening him from that intense agony.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These cries... were Tina's cries.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler struggled to open his eyes, using all his strength. With trembling hands, he propped himself up and looked at Tina, who was beneath him, her face filled with tears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was crying...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her tears kept streaming down her cheeks, so many tears that it almost took his breath away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had once vowed to himself never to make her cry again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, he had made her cry once more!</span></p></div>
