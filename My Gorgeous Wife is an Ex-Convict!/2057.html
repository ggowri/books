        <h1>Chapter 2055</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The police station was filled with children involved in the fight, their parents, as well as the teacher and the person in charge of the training institution.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Among all these people, the expression of the person in charge of the institution looked the worst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Who would have thought there would be such a fight in the changing room? Of course, this whole thing would be over if both parties were ordinary people. The children just had to apologize to each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, one of the children was the son of Weiss Group's chairman and the heir of the Weiss family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The person in charge cursed in his head countless times. 'Did I hire these employees for nothing? How could they not have informed me that the little young master of the Weiss family was here to learn taekwondo?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The teacher of the institution was also depressed. 'Well... The woman who registered for the kid named Nelson Corbyn and the elderly who often brings him to class didn't look rich!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I even asked the child before and learned his family only ran a small store!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Besides, the child has the last name Zhuo, not Ye. Who would&rsquo;ve known he's the little young master of the Weiss family?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The lawyer Martin Weiss found also came over hurriedly and said they would pursue the assailants. Since the assailants were children, their parents would be held responsible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The parents instantly paled, especially Roy Soto's parents who only wanted to beat up their son on the spot. They had offended the Reed and the Stephenson families, causing their business to plummet. Now, they had even offended the Weiss family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss was even Nelson Corbyn's biological father!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Their family would only be in more trouble now that the kid&rsquo;s father was standing up for his son!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Mr. Soto and Mrs. Soto dragged their son over to apologize to Martin Weiss and Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mr. Weiss, well... It's our fault for not disciplining our child and letting him misbehave. But he's still young. I hope you'll forgive him, Mr. Weiss. We'll pay for the medical expenses," pleaded Mr. Soto.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss only snorted coldly. "Who are you to pay for my son? And what do you mean that your child is still young? From what I know, this isn't the first time your son has picked on my son. He's young, but don&rsquo;t you know how to discipline him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss was already domineering. Mr. Soto and Mrs. Soto immediately broke out in a cold sweat as soon as he said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's gaze fell on Roy Soto's face again. He had also had his men investigate the child and knew how much malice the child had toward Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Normally, he would have ignored such children, but he was filled with rage when he saw his son curled up on the floor after being beaten by a group of children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The rage was directed at these nine to ten-year-olds as well as at himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Does bullying Nelson make you feel good?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Roy Soto had been scolded by his parents for quite a long and was filled with fury. He instantly said to Martin Weiss, "He's just a deaf person, and I dislike him. You're rich, so my parents are afraid of you, but I'm not. What can you do to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The boy spoke as he gave his parents a disdainful glare. It was as if he thought they were too cowardly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes were cold. "Sooner or later, you'll know how it feels when someone dislikes you. Just like how I dislike you now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mr. Weiss!" The Hu couple's legs went limp with fear when they heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss ignored them and said to the lawyer, "Let no one go unaccountable!"</p></div>
