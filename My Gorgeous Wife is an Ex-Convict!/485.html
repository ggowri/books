        <h1>Chapter 484</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand touched her cheek with great care. Then, he opened his thin lips and said in a husky, repressed voice, "Can you love me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It sounded like begging. It was like he longed for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She unconsciously licked her lips, making her lips look more delicate and alluring. She did not know how to answer him, and even for a moment there, it seemed as though she could not think. Her whole being was enveloped in his smell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her beautiful face, black eyes, small nose, accompanied by her mouth that was moving and licking as if she was seducing him, made him more and more unable to suppress his desire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted her, he wanted her so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thought grew stronger and stronger in his mind. When he faced her, his desire was like a beast that was about to break through the gates&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His lips once again pressed against hers, only this kiss was more tender and lingering than the fierce and domineering kiss earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like he was trying to put his mark and leave his scent on her, making her remember his kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kissed her again and again. Then, his long fingers gently pulled her clothes away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When her skin got goosebumps from sudden contact with the air, Grace immediately came to herself. She blushed and looked shyly at Jason. She subconsciously covered her chest with one hand while she used the other to push against his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I..." she stammered, and there was an obvious timidity in her almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, this was not what she had expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The timidity in her eyes made his eyes clear up gradually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew that she was afraid, or rather, she was not ready or even in love with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was too impatient. He was so eager for her that he had neglected her feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry..." he muttered as his fingers reluctantly left her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he wanted her badly, he did not want it to happen when she was afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted her to be willing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he finished speaking, he straightened his body. His thin lips breathed heavily. His beautiful amorous eyes were full of suppression and endurance, but his lips still tried to raise a smile. He said to her with the utmost restraint, "You needn't be afraid. I'm not going to do it. I won't if you don't want me to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nothing was more important to him than her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pulled the blanket over her, got out of bed, and turned toward the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay!" Almost subconsciously, she called to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she was timid and scared just now, she was now worried about him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. I'll just take a cold shower," Jason said with some difficulty as he paused in his tracks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was the moment when he desperately needed to suppress the desire in his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only the next moment, there was a movement behind him. Then, a pair of slender arms wrapped around his waist as a delicate body attached to his back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's body suddenly stiffened, and his suppressed desire almost gushed out under her embrace.</p></div>
