        <h1>Chapter 2936</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't hurt," he said. "So you don't need to worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"With such a long wound, I don't know if it will leave a scar in the future," she muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if there is a scar, it doesn't matter," he said. "I am a man, and I don't care about having a few scars on my body. But if you don't like it, I can do scar removal treatment later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was taken aback. He seemed to be trying to cater to her preferences.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Cater? Valda Theller quickly shook her head. What was she thinking? "The nurse just said you have two other pills to take after changing your medicine. You...you should take the pills first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she quickly picked up the two pills that the nurse had left on the bedside table, measured out the dosage, poured a glass of warm water, and handed it to Brian Hart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart took the pills, mixed them with water, and swallowed them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, if you feel uncomfortable here, you can go back. There are doctors, nurses, caregivers, and enough people to take care of me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hesitated, and he could tell she was uncomfortable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You were injured for me, so I have a responsibility to stay here and take care of you," she quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A hint of sadness flashed in his eyes. Responsibility? She stayed here not just because of responsibility, but for other reasons too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Well, Brian Hart, what are you still fantasizing about? He silently said to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because of the medicine, Brian Hart soon fell asleep, and Valda Theller silently watched him sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when he was asleep, he seemed fragile, and his pale face made her heart ache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was she really just staying in the hospital to take care of him out of a sense of responsibility? No, she knew it was more than that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to take care of him personally and do things that she could do to help him, even though...any caregiver could do those things. But she still wanted to do them herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared at Brian Hart for a long time until the door of the ward was pushed open, and a figure walked in, snapping her out of her thoughts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But when she turned her head, the person who came in was Patrick Weiss, a friend of Brian Hart whom she had met before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You...you're here to see Brian Hart, right? He's asleep and may not wake up for a while," Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick Weiss looked at Valda Theller. "I heard from Brian Hart's men outside that you've been taking care of Brian Hart here for the past two days. You've worked hard."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He was injured to save me, so it's only right that I take care of him," she quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How is his injury?" Patrick Weiss asked. He had only learned about his friend's hospitalization from Mr. Hart and Madam Hart, and had rushed to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He was stabbed in the waist and abdomen and had eleven stitches. Fortunately, he didn't hit any vital organs. The doctor asked him to stay in the hospital for observation. If there are no problems, he can be discharged in a few days," Valda Theller said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick Weiss muttered, "Hmm...it seems he really cares about you. He was willing to make a heroic move to save you. If it were me in danger, he would probably just look on coldly."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller, who had been saved like a damsel in distress, felt a little embarrassed. "He...he would save you too. You're his friend, he..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I know his personality," Patrick Weiss shrugged. "He's always very indifferent to people and things, except for the people he cares about. It was Grace back then, and now it's..."</p></div>
