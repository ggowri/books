        <h1>Chapter 2992</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cake had reached her lips, and she blushed. Her big round eyes sparkled as she finally took the cake that was handed to her. She blushed even more as she swallowed it down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it delicious?" A clear and elegant voice sounded in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda blushed so much that it seemed like she was about to bleed, and quietly replied with two words, "It's delicious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled and said, "I think so too, it's really delicious..." As he finished speaking, he kissed her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side, Whitney walked out of the Hart Group building with a heart full of anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looks so much like Grace, with deliberate styling that makes her almost 90% similar, but... Brian still looks down on her and instead has taken a liking to Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What did that woman do to Brian to make him admit on live television that she was his girlfriend?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking about this, Whitney's jealousy towards Valda deepened even more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And now, what should she do? Does she really have to leave Emerald City? Or maybe...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Whitney was hesitating, a figure suddenly emerged from the shadows and approached her. "It seems Miss. Cooper is also someone who has been abandoned. Would you be willing to talk to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You--" Whitney looked at the other person, a look of surprise flashing across her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think the two of us have at least one common goal, which is Valda. So, we should have a lot of things to talk about, right? If Valda is out of the picture, then maybe Brian will be yours," the other person said again. "Anyway, my car is right here. Do you want to talk? It's up to you to decide."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the other person finished speaking, they walked towards an inconspicuous black car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney stared at the other person's back and after a while, finally bit her lip and followed...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as Valda was out of the picture, she could definitely take her place, become Brian's girlfriend, and eventually become the Hart family's lady!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the following period of time, Valda spent almost every day studying English, except for her work on comics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whenever she spent time with Brian, he would communicate with her in English for simple daily conversations. At first, she stumbled a lot, but now she has improved a lot. Even if there were some conversations she couldn't follow, she wouldn't panic like she did at the beginning. She would use some other words to make up for it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian felt sorry for Valda. He saw that she had lost weight during this time, so he said, "Why don't I find a translator to accompany you throughout the process, so you don't have to work so hard to study English?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Wouldn't that make me stand out too much?" Valda shook her head and said, "Those comic artists who are more qualified than me don't have a personal translator with them. If I have one, it would feel strange."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then how about we go out and relax tomorrow since it's the weekend?" Brian suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tomorrow, I plan to go back to my high school." Valda said, "It's my high school's anniversary tomorrow, and I haven't been there in a long time. I want to see my old school and my former teachers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll accompany you," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda responded.</p></div>
