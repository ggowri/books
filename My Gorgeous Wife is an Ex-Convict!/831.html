        <h1>Chapter 830</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's... here too?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect to bump into him again so soon. It seemed like such a small world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up, and a figure caught her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was wearing an all-white casual outfit that was less formal than his usual attire and more laid-back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Under the lamp&rsquo;s light, the handsome face showed a touch of indifference and estrangement. Even if he was surrounded by the crowd, there was an invisible barrier that made him look like he was somewhat out of place from the commotion around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he had put up a barrier in his world and would never allow anyone to enter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The one&hellip; who was able to break through this barrier was only the little girl who went through thick and thin with him... Someone she used to be!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Grace's eyes fell on the woman who had walked into the room while holding onto Brian's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Stella who had taken over her place. She was now standing next to Brian, a beaming smile plastered across her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching Stella and Brian standing next to each other, Grace suddenly had an indescribable feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, then she told herself she had nothing to worry about. She was the one who had decided to let go of that fact and bury her childhood memory forever, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she had repeatedly denied being the little girl in front of Brian, there was no reason to think about it now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, those dark phoenix eyes looked in her direction and met her gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a split second, Grace felt a pang in her heart. The pair of phoenix eyes that were looking at her now was so cold as if he was looking at a stranger instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The words he had said before immediately rang in her head. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t have any more affection for you from now on.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, now she was only a stranger to him. The little girl who had gone through thick and thin with him and carried him down the hill when he was younger was Stella!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella, standing next to Brian, followed Brian's eyes and saw Grace standing beside the pool table. She immediately froze and felt a little uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is Grace here? Why is she... standing there like that? Where's Jason? He's not with Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I had known, I wouldn't have wanted to come here today!' Stella regretted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had insisted on Brian bringing her to the party today for her to broaden her horizons, thinking she could quickly fit into high society.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It also created the illusion that she was Brian's girlfriend. 'Even though Brian doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge me as his girlfriend, as long as everyone around me thinks so, wouldn't I have a chance to get to the top?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just did not expect Grace to be here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the sight of Grace, Stella could not help feeling a surge of guilt!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She worried that her false identity would be exposed one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Gu, it's a pleasure to have you here today. I heard that you're good at pool. I wonder if you&rsquo;d like to play one round with me," said Curtis Row as he stepped forward, eager to find a topic to talk about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not expect Brian to reply to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, his status was nowhere near Brian in their circle.</p></div>
