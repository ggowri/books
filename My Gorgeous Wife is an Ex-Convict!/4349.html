        <h1>Chapter 4347 Let's Talk About Breaking Off the Engagement</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert looked up to see a handsome young man walking straight towards him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley looked at the man who had just arrived, "How did you end up here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I came looking for you," Lornell said. Just now, at the school gate, he overheard some students gossiping about her having a meal with a boy at a snack bar. He decided to check it out, and to his surprise, it turned out to be true.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you need something?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell raised an eyebrow, "What do you think I'm here for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley pursed his lips, probably because he was about to break off the engagement!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Or are you going to continue having dinner with him and we'll talk about our stuff another day?" Lornell said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's brow furrowed slightly. She didn't want to drag out this matter of breaking off the engagement any longer. The sooner it was resolved, the better!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She turned to Calvert with an apologetic look, "Sorry, I have something to take care of today and need to leave early. Next time, I'll treat you to a meal, okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Calvert responded in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get going then," Lornell said to Harley. Before leaving, Lornell shot a quick glance at Calvert from the corner of his eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's gaze was indifferent and superior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert stiffened. He often saw this kind of gaze in those who held power.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This guy, he was on the same level as Harley, wasn't he?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But Harley was different, he never looked at him that way.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley and Lornell stepped out of the snack bar, with Lornell's car parked not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's get in the car first," Lornell said. "I don't want to discuss what's next just anywhere. After all, if some ill-intentioned people overhear us, it could get a bit tricky."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them got in the car, and Lornell drove it over to the club.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once they were in the private room, Lornell casually asked Harley, "What would you like to drink?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No need, let's just get straight to the point," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell suddenly let out a cold laugh, "What? You don't even have time to have a drink with me now? But you do have time to dine with other men. Don't tell me you're breaking off our engagement because of that young boy."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's eyes widened in surprise, "My decision to break off our engagement has nothing to do with Calvert!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could Lornell have been so imaginative?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His name is Calvert, right?" Lornell asked, "Since he's not the reason you want to break off the engagement, then tell me, what is the reason?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley looked at the person in front of him, took a deep breath, and said, "I don't want to marry someone just because it's convenient!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell raised an eyebrow, "What's wrong with 'suitable'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley gave a bitter smile, "It's not that it's bad, it's just not good enough. I hope my future marriage will be like my parents, where they love each other!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing what Harley had to say, Lornell was stunned for a moment, but then suddenly burst into laughter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's laughter was laced with mockery.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't believe you're so naive, Harley. How many people do you think have a love like your parents in this world? It's like some people's parents hit the jackpot. Do their children also </span><span>believe they'll be as lucky as their parents and hit the jackpot again?" Lornell stopped laughing, looking indifferently at Harley sitting on the sofa.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's eyelashes fluttered slightly, "You might be right, but for me, if a future marriage doesn't have love, then I'd rather not have that marriage at all!"</span></p></div>
