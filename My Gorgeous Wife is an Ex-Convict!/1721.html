        <h1>Chapter 1719</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lily looked coldly at Sean, who was complaining. "I only made the mistake of loving you too much! A man like you isn't worth it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Sean glared at Lily. "You said you did all that because you loved me, but it was simply because you didn't want to be in your sister&rsquo;s shadow for the rest of your life. After everything you've done wrong, you must turn yourself in!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What if I don't want to?" asked Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then I'll call the police," said Sean as he took out his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next moment, Lily suddenly waved her hand toward the children's play area inside the KFC outlet and shouted, "William, come here!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A little boy who had been sitting in the corner watching others play slowly got up and walked out of the play area to walk over to Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean's fingers paused just as he was prepared to dial 110. "This kid..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He's my son." Lily smiled like a confident hunter waiting for her prey to jump into her trap. "He's your son too, Sean. Are you going to call the police now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean instantly felt that his hands seemed to weigh a thousand pounds!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was looking through some documents in his study. It was an investigation report on Mason Swanson, which contained all the records available from his birth until now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Ordinary people would not think there was any problem with the records, but Jason found a major problem.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In short, the record was so perfect that it seemed to be designed for people who were investigating Mason Swanson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Nothing was missing from the records. Even the records of the child&rsquo;s dead biological parents were in order.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... the child's biological parents were also orphans with no relatives or friends. Therefore, what they could investigate was very limited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason gazed at the photos of Mason Swanson's biological parents in the documents. There was no resemblance between the two people and the child&mdash;not even the slightest resemblance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason Swanson's blood sample should be available in two days, while Grace and his blood samples were already recorded in the police's missing person's department because they had been looking for the child Secretary Wang hid all this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Once they got Mason Swanson's blood sample, they could determine whether he was Grace and his child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason closed the documents in his hands and walked out of his study. He saw Uncle Kwan coming out of his son's room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are the children asleep?" he asked, knowing that his daughter liked to sleep with his son in his room these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," replied Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Where's Young Madam? Is she home yet?" Jason asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, but Young Madam called earlier and said she might be back late tonight," said Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason frowned slightly. Grace had gone out in the evening because of a phone call from Lina. She said that she was going to help Lina relax because she was upset about something.</p></div>
