        <h1>Chapter 3362</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before, she always thought her daughter just loved to join in the fun, but when faced with danger, she definitely ran faster than anyone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, after this incident, she realized that she had some misconceptions about her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I'm just trying to help Harley. I can't let him suffer any losses," Tina defended herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Harley is only three years old, how old are you?" Lina said irritably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm only eight years old," Tina said with a very aggrieved expression, looking at her mother with a "I'm just a baby" look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina was choked and suddenly didn't know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, okay, Tina knows she was wrong, so please don't scold her anymore," Hadwin finally spoke up and defended his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This fight ended relatively peacefully, fortunately it didn't escalate into something bigger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If things really escalate, it may end up with a direct confrontation between their families and the Crypt families on the other side, and it could get out of control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tina, do you know what you did wrong?" said Hadwin, while gesturing towards his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina, who often makes mistakes, has already reached an understanding with her father in this regard. She quickly nodded her head and said, "I understand, I understand."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What should I do if I encounter this kind of situation again in the future?" Hadwin asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We should fight while asking Jasmine to go find an adult to help!" Tina replied smoothly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin wiped his forehead with a sweat, reluctant to admit the fact that his daughter's intelligence may not meet the standard of being smart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you still want to fight?" Lina said. "What you should do is stop the fight and take the opportunity to find an adult to resolve this matter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh." Tina quickly obediently responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In short, it's best if Mom doesn't get angry. But if she does, she's definitely the one in charge!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Fortunately, none of you kids got seriously hurt today. Otherwise, you would have seen me beat you up," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she said those words, Chandler, who was also in the living room, furrowed his brow and spoke up, "This is my fault. I brought those people to the birthday party and I didn't keep up with Tina."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At the beginning, he should have realized that those people were usually reckless and taking a few people without anyone to restrain them could easily lead to trouble. However, at that time, Tina and Harley, along with a few other girls, were together, so he didn't follow them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he had been walking beside him at that time, then this incident wouldn't have happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right, if Chandler had followed me, this wouldn't have happened," Tina quickly agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her agreement only earned her a bigger eye-roll from Lina. "You have the nerve to say that? Come on, tell me, how many times has Chandler bailed you out of trouble from all the mischief you've caused since childhood?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina pouted and said, "Mommy, I'm only 8 years old, I'm not considered grown up yet!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina feels like she's about to be driven crazy by her daughter. When she tries to teach her daughter a lesson, her daughter even corrects her choice of words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In short, you are not allowed to go to the Sleeping Cat Cartoon Exhibition!" Lina concluded bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina suddenly burst into tears!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">You should know that Sleeping Cat is a cartoon character that she has been obsessed with for two years. She watches the Sleeping Cat animated series every day and has a lot of Sleeping Cat merchandise at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This time, Sleeping Cat is hosting a themed exhibition in Emerald City, and Tina is very excited about it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many classmates in her class also planned to go see it, so she naturally didn't want to miss out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I also plan to bring all my pocket money from my savings jar, so that I can buy lots and lots of Sleeping Cat merchandise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If we were to describe Tina as an idol or a fan favorite, she would undoubtedly be a crazy fan of Sleeping Cat.</p></div>
