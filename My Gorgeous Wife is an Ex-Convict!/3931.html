        <h1>Chapter 3929</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you doing?" Clarissa struggled, but it was of no use.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The surrounding crowd also glanced over and whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about you? Are you going to hit her back? You can slap her as many times as you want until you feel satisfied!" Mick said to Nancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked at him somewhat dazed, unable to figure out what Mick was thinking at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa, on the other hand, shouted, "You can't hit me! I...I'll call the police. Even if you're the young master of the Reed family, you can't treat me like this..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course you can call the police," Mick said calmly, "I'm just helping the person who was hit to get some justice. How come you never thought about how it feels to be hit by someone else when you like to slap others?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's voice was tinged with a hint of coldness, and there was a slight curve at the corner of his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those who knew him well understood that this represented his bad mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa's face turned red and white, and Mick's gaze turned to Nancy again. "Do you want to hit her? If you're afraid she'll call the police, I'll find you the best lawyer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need. I already hit her back with that slap she gave me just now," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so?" Mick raised his lips and raised his hand again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two bodyguards who were holding Clarissa let go, and Clarissa collapsed to the ground weakly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I remember warning the Schultz family already," Mick looked down at Clarissa and said, "If there's a next time, then the Schultz family really has no reason to exist."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa trembled, feeling a sense of fear rising within her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was...Mick, the young master of the Reed family, and also the person who could call the shots in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he is still young, only 25 years old, he is enough to make many big shots in Emerald City fear him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In addition to being called a genius with his intelligence, he also has some methods of doing things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many people say in private that as he grows older, Mr. Reed's style of doing things is becoming more and more like his father Jason's style.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Clarissa has also heard some rumors about Jason from her own father.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It is said that early on, Jason's style of doing things was ruthless and bloody, and no one in Emerald City dared to provoke him. Later, after having children and a family, he gradually became more restrained and his style of doing things became much milder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, many of the older generation in Emerald City understand that even if he is mild, this "mildness" is only superficial.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So no one dares to provoke the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because once provoked, it may be another bloody storm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick turned to Nancy and asked, "What about you, where are you going?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm off work and want to go to the market before going home," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll take you there," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned, watching as Mick walked over to a black Bentley car. She stammered, "But I have to go to the market!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is there a rule that I can't take you to the market?" he asked in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hesitated for a moment, then followed him into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, Mick undoubtedly boosted her confidence in front of Clarissa. After today's incident, it is likely that Clarissa will not dare to cause trouble for her for a while.</p></div>
