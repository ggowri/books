        <h1>Chapter 1848</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His unusual behavior made her freeze. "Jay, what happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Tell me if what I just said is right." There was a hint of urgency in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, you're right. You're the one I love the most, and I&rsquo;ll always be by your side." Grace raised her hands and hugged Jason back. "Tell me, what&rsquo;s going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He did not say anything but continued to hug her tightly as his chin rested on her shoulder. Each breath seemed a little heavy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, we're husband and wife. Whatever happens, I&rsquo;ll face it with you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was silent for a moment before saying slowly, "I... just feel bad for my father. He loved the woman so much that he even betrayed his family and left the Reed family just to be with that woman. But that woman abandoned my father and me without hesitation because he couldn't give her any more money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace knew that the woman he was talking about was his mother. "It was her loss to have lost your father. She&rsquo;ll find out that no man in the world will ever love her as much as your father loved her. She&rsquo;ll regret it. She&rsquo;ll regret the decision she made at that time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Regret?" Jason suddenly sneered. "How could a woman like her ever feel regret? She's probably enjoying her life right now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace slowly cupped Jason's face. "Jay, don't let your mother dictate your life anymore. Those things are in the past. No one knows where your mother is and whether she's alive or dead. But you have your own life. If you keep dwelling on the past, you'll never be truly happy. Jay, stop thinking about it, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Stop thinking about it?" His eyelashes quivered gently. Then, he slowly looked up and stared at her. "What will you do if my mother appears in front of me one day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Me?" She froze a little. She had never thought of such a thing. "I don't know. It's up to you to decide what happens between you and your mother, but I hope you won't regret any decisions you make."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes gleamed. "You said it. It's up to me to decide, and I won't regret whatever decision I make!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His hand caught the back of her head and he kissed her hard on the lips once he was done talking...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay... Enough... Enough..." Grace said, nearly passing out several times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Not enough... Grace. It's far from enough." His fingers interlocked with hers, and his voice was hoarse with endless longing while his beautiful eyes were filled with suppressed and indecipherable darkness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Finally, Grace was so tired that she fell asleep. Jason stared at her sleeping face for a long time before picking her up and walking into the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason muttered, "Grace, will you stay out of whatever happens tomorrow? Just watch quietly. If that person... isn't 'her', I'll let her off the hook for your sake, but there's only one woman in the world that I won't let off the hook!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If he let that woman off the hook, then the pain he suffered when he was little and his father's death would have been for nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Early the next morning, Grace wore a turtleneck sweater and accompanied Old Lawyer Watts and Mrs. Watts to the Reed family's cemetery.</p></div>
