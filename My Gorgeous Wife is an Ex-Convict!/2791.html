        <h1>Chapter 2789</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A few hours later, the online gossip about her kissing Brian was removed, but her friends, assistants, and some people familiar with her had already found out that her boyfriend was Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone from the film set even called her to ask if it was true.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could only chuckle drily and answer vaguely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman rushed into Raymond Bowman's office in a rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Bowman, I'm sorry. This lady insisted on meeting you, and I failed to stop her..." the secretary said apologetically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's okay. Go out first," said Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, the secretary left the office and closed the door. Barbara Schuman and Raymond Bowman were instantly left alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you already know that Valda Theller is dating Brian?" Barbara Schuman barked. Her face that was covered with delicate makeup was full of exasperation. She was not at all calm like usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Raymond Bowman answered without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman instantly felt that what she said in front of Raymond Bowman after their reunion was like a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought Valda Theller was only a lamb waiting to be slaughtered as before and she could easily trample over her again. However, she did not expect the lamb to be attached to a lion. She was in big trouble now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why didn't you tell me? Do you intend to see me make a fool of myself?" Barbara Schuman yelled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Compared to her agitation, Raymond Bowman was calm. "No one wants to see you make a fool of yourself. Nothing would&rsquo;ve happened as long as you didn&rsquo;t do anything to Valda."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman gritted her teeth angrily. "I only did it for you. I just wanted you to love me and didn't want you to be distracted by her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman said sarcastically, "Barbara Schuman, you never loved me. You just want to find a sense of existence and triumph in me. You want to be admired by others. You'll crush anyone you dislike as well as those who take over your limelight! Valda Theller never did anything to you. But you treated her viciously just because she outshone you in drawing comics!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, he said with a bitter smile, "And I became your accomplice. I was blind to have fallen for someone like you and hurt the person I truly like."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman said, "Raymond Bowman, so you know you were my accomplice. Then you should also know that you can't get away if Valda Theller tries to get revenge on us through Brian! So what we should do now is join hands against Valda Theller and find out the truth about her relationship with Brian. There's no reason for Brian to fall for a woman like Valda Theller&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman interrupted her, "I won't help you, let alone join hands with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think you can get away with it?" Barbara Schuman asked sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I never thought I could get away with it. Maybe it's time for me and you to pay the price," murmured Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman's expression changed. "Pay the price? What&rsquo;s Valda Theller without Brian? There must be something going on between them. Raymond Bowman, you won't join forces with me? Fine, I'll see what price you'll pay!"</p></div>
