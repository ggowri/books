        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she held him tightly and deepened the kiss. It was as if this moment was everything to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sometime later, the kiss finally ended. Her face, hair, and body were thoroughly wet from the warm water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter?" asked Jason as he raised his hand to wipe the water off Grace's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just... wanted to tell you I love you all of a sudden!" said Grace. Her delicate chin, straight nose, and almond-shaped eyes became wetter because of the mist. Her pink lips opened and closed. She looked so seductive yet pitiful that no one would have expected her to be a mother of three.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did you come in all of a sudden just to tell me you love me?" He could not help but laugh and ask. After all, it seemed to be the first time she did this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah," she said. Her fingers ran gently over his eyebrows, the outer corner of his eyes, his nose bridge, and finally settled on his lips. "Jay, I want you to know that you&rsquo;ll always be the person I love the most!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As he carried her out of the bathroom and back into bed, she held his face and said, "Jay, I miss you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After some lovemaking, Grace's stomach let out an inappropriate growl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Are you hungry?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, a little. I didn't eat much when I was accompanying Lina in the hospital," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll have someone make you some food," he said as he got up and put on his night robe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No!" She quickly caught him. "It's so late and the maids are already asleep. I'll just find something in the kitchen and cook it myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll do it, then. I'll bring it to you when it's ready," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She took her clothes and put them on. "I'll do it. Speaking of which, I haven't cooked anything for you in a long time. I'll make something and we'll eat together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her body was sore because of their &lsquo;activity&rsquo; just now, so she was also slower when putting on her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason bent over to help Grace get dressed. His long fingers buttoned her clothes one by one. He also crouched down to put slippers on her feet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace lowered her head and stared blankly at the man half-kneeling in front of her. Her eyes could not help watering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once they were dressed, they went downstairs. The first floor was silent and deserted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace went to the kitchen, looked at the ingredients in the refrigerator, and said to Jason, "Why don't I make vegetable beef soup? It'll be quick. The beef strips will be cooked once I add them into the pot."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, you can make whatever you want," Jason said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace suddenly trembled a little. "Can I... really make whatever I want?" There was a note of hesitation in her voice as she asked this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, you can make whatever you want. I'll eat whatever you make." His eyes were serene like water, and this gentleness was only for her and the children. It was unlike the look in his eye when he was in front of others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace suddenly found the vegetables and beef strips in her hands extremely heavy. She forced a smile. "Are you still going to eat it if my food tastes terrible and is hard to swallow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Even if you gave me poison, I&rsquo;d take it," he said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..." She was dumbfounded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But I know you won't because you can't bear to do so, right?" he said.</p></div>
