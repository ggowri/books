        <h1>Chapter 867</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What does he mean by that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at Jason, only seeing his almost perfect thin lips open and close as he said, "Haven't you always wanted to have a family? Well, why don't you keep on being my sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace froze, then she felt a sudden urge to laugh. "Do you want me to continue being your sis while you be my brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Isn't it a good idea?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, do you know you're being ridiculous?" She really laughed out loud. "You said you wanted us to date, so we dated. Then, you wanted to break up and we did. Now what? Are you going to play the sibling game again because you've grown tired of the dating game?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face immediately darkened. "It's not a game. You can be my sis. No one in Emerald City will dare to disrespect you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't need that, and you're not my brother." She snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could I ever see this man who I&rsquo;ve loved so deeply as my brother?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you that against being my sis?" His beautiful amorous eyes narrowed, revealing a glint of danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I'm not you. I can't just change like you can! We&rsquo;ve broken up. Please don't disturb my life again! You said it's too tiring to be with me, so I won't appear in front of you anymore. Please stop appearing in front of me as well!" Grace said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her indifference stung his eyes. It was as if she would reject him from getting any closer to her no matter what he did!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why was he in such torment when she could so easily put him out of her mind?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he thought of how happy she was at the amusement park with another man today, the feeling of jealousy surged back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lowered his head and kissed her hard on the lips again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No! I don't want it!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave him a sharp bite, and the smell of blood immediately filled her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the kiss did not stop as she had hoped. It only became more and more violent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Mhm&hellip;' Grace could only feel the smell of blood in her mouth getting stronger and stronger. Right. She had bitten the tip of someone's tongue when she was kissed in her sleep that night&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, the kiss was over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could only taste blood in her mouth. A trail of blood dripped from the corner of Jason's lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is the second time..." he said slowly as he used his hand to wipe the trail of blood from his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The second time? Sure enough, he&rsquo;s the one who kissed me that night!' Glaring at the person in front of her, Grace suddenly sneered, "A brother wouldn't kiss his sister like that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face immediately darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason left. After Grace said those words, he left without saying a word, and Grace almost collapsed to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'My mouth is filled with the smell of blood. It's... his blood!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she had rinsed her mouth several times, the smell of blood lingered in her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sis? Brother?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not figure out what Jason wanted. 'Is he so bored that he wants to do this all over again?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was not going to play along with his games!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head and told herself not to think about Jason any more.</p></div>
