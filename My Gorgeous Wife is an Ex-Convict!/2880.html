        <h1>Chapter 2878</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He used to hope Valda Theller could save him from his messy love life, but she let him go before he could move on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian saw Valda Theller again, Valda Theller was lying in bed, already asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a gentle hand wave, the two bodyguards quietly exited the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He went to the bedside and quietly looked at her sleeping face. She had a pretty face, a delicate nose, and pale pink lips. She seemed so quiet and gentle, but she was frowning slightly in her sleep as if she was having a bad dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian leaned over and gently touched the slight frown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to care for and protect the woman. He seemed to crave seeing her smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more he understood what she had experienced, the more his heart broke for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to build a safe wall for her so that no one could hurt her, but now, he was the one hurting her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her head moved, and her eyelashes fluttered twice before she opened her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Their eyes met each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Bri Brian?" Valda Theller was surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian withdrew his hand calmly and straightened up. "I woke you up. You can stay in this room and use everything in the mansion. If you need anything else, you can tell the two bodyguards. They&rsquo;ll do the shopping for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I can never leave the mansion, right?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His gaze fell darkly on her face." Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip slightly and lifted the thin blanket before getting out of bed. "I think we need to talk. Can we talk?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was silent for a moment before moving to the couch and sitting nonchalantly. "Okay, tell me what you want to talk to me about." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller took a deep breath and said, "First of all, we've broken up. Second, it&rsquo;ll be unfortunate for the baby to be born if I'm really pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can our child be unfortunate?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think they can be happy growing up in an unhappy family?" she retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think our family will be unhappy if we get married?" He stared at her with a gaze that was imperceptibly pressuring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller chuckled bitterly. "If we get married and I still love you, my love might be twisted by jealousy over the years and become hatred. The child will be affected by my hatred. If I stop loving you, we'll only treat each other like strangers. Our marriage will only be a shell. Will our child be happy in an indifferent family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned. Valda Theller saying she would stop loving him irritated him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think you'll be able to stop loving me?" he asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea. Perhaps she could not. After all, how could she fall in love again after falling for a man like him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Meeting his eyes, she did not want to admit it. "Yes, I can do it. If I can love you, I can stop loving you too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression turned ghastly before he got up and walked up to her, his height making the pressure all the more intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda Theller, you can't do it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not me. How do you know I can't do it?" Valda Theller said defiantly.</p></div>
