        <h1>Chapter 3982</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she arrived at the prison and saw Clarissa in her prison uniform through the transparent glass window, she felt like she was in a different world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I heard that Mick abandoned you," Clarissa began with a direct statement.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you ask to see me just to say that?" Nancy looked at her calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that even though Clarissa was in prison, she still knew what was happening outside, even the fact that Nancy and Mick had broken up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just wanted to see what you look like after being abandoned," Clarissa suddenly giggled, but her twisted expression made it particularly uncomfortable to watch.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whether I was abandoned or not, you are destined to spend your days in prison. Will mocking me make your days any better?" Nancy said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Clarissa only wanted Nancy to come to see her to satisfy her own psychological balance by seeing Nancy's miserable state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unfortunately, Nancy had no intention of fulfilling Clarissa's wishes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"My days won't be any better, but seeing you suffer makes me happier!" Clarissa said viciously, "Nancy, this is your punishment for what you did to me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not me who harmed you, it's yourself. You killed my mother, otherwise, you wouldn't be here today!" Nancy retorted. "As for me, I won't evade whatever punishment I deserve. Clarissa, I won't come to see you here again. This is the last time we meet!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Nancy stood up and left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>From now on, she would leave Emerald City for another city and try to slowly let go of her feelings for Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If the Reed family really wanted to punish her, she would bear it one by one and never evade it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She used Mick to achieve her own goals, so it was only natural to accept punishment!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, when Nancy walked outside the prison, a black car stopped in front of her. Then, a stranger got out of the driver's seat and approached her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Nancy, Mr. Reed wants to see you," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Reed?" Nancy was stunned. "Is it... Mick?" The only Mr. Reed she knew was Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's Jason Mr. Reed," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was taken aback.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason... he was Mick's father! The real power holder of the Reed family!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In Emerald City, there were too many rumors about Jason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that he loved his wife dearly and was a good husband and father.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was also said that he was ruthless. Except for the Reed family and those approved by them, he had no sympathy or concern for anyone else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Furthermore, if anyone offended the Reed family, this head of the Reed family would make sure that person would suffer a fate worse than death!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She...has now offended Mick, hasn't she?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So now...is this her punishment?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy stiffly got into the car and the driver drove her to the entrance of the Reed Group building.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Fowler, please follow me." The driver said, got out of the car, and led Nancy into the elevator that went directly to the chairman's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy followed the driver almost absentmindedly, all the way to the door of the chairman's office.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the office door was pushed open, the driver walked to the side of the door and made a "please" gesture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy took a deep breath and walked in.</span></p></div>
