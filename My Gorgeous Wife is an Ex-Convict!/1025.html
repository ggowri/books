        <h1>Chapter 1024</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's run away together, Kyla. Forget about the stall for now!" said Grace as she grabbed Kyla Corbyn and quickly dialed 110 with her fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina also picked up a chair and threw it at the three men as she said to Kyla Corbyn, "Let's run away together. They're here to make trouble on purpose! I'll get Hadwin Stephenson to teach them a lesson later!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, Hadwin Stephenson was not here right now, so she could only think of ways to protect themselves!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, is this 110? I have a disturbance here. They want to harm me and my friends..." As soon as the line got through, Grace spoke quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Damn it, the b*tch called the police! Grab her phone!" one of them spoke as he jumped at Grace. She was just about to give her address when a shadow flashed by and a muffled grunt rang afterward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A man who had appeared out of nowhere was hitting the man who wanted to attack Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two other men tried to help, but another man appeared and began to fight them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was completely one-sided. The two men knocked the three thugs to the ground, making them scream in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't think... we need to run anymore!" mumbled Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked on in surprise, still caught in a trance. She was going to run, but now the tables had turned!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace recognized the two men who had suddenly appeared. They were the bodyguards Jason sent to follow her. These two men also showed up to save her when Elise Dean's die-hard fan tried to attack her at the film studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea the two bodyguards were still around!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss, where are you? We'll send the police over," said the 110 operator at the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace muttered, "No thanks... It should be alright now. I'll&hellip; take the three attackers to the police station to give their statements later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace put her phone away, the two bodyguards came forward and asked, "Miss Cummins, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shook her head. "I'm fine. Thanks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't mention it. Mr. Reed sent us to follow you around. It's our job to keep you safe, Miss Cummins," said the two men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What? You're Jason's men?" Lina asked in surprise before turning to look at Grace. "Does that mean Jason has eyes on you every day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a wry smile. "It seems so, but every coin has two sides. At least, we're safe because of them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's true." Lina scratched her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned to Kyla Corbyn and said, "Kyla, you can go on with your business. Lina and I will go to the police station to make a report and give them our statements. The police will have a record of this if these people come troubling you again next time. It'll serve as evidence for your protection."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you!" said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a car suddenly rushed over and stopped at the roadside. A figure got out of the car and strode to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin..." Lina had just spoken a word when Hadwin Stephenson turned her body left and right to examine it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What was that all about? Are you hurt?" Hadwin Stephenson asked worriedly.</p></div>
