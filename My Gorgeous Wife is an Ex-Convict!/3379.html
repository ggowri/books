        <h1>Chapter 3377</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell turned his head and saw Harley smiling brightly at him, saying "The slide is so much fun, isn't it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This smile, with a certain infectiousness, suddenly made Lornell feel like sliding down with her, which wasn't such a bad thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a loud explosion suddenly rang out in the restaurant, and Lornell felt as if his body had been hit by a violent shock. Immediately, everything went black and he fell into a coma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And at the moment he passed out, the only thing he felt was a small hand firmly holding his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Someone's voice, as if crying and shouting, sounded in his ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted to move, but he couldn't move at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though he opened his eyes now, what he saw was still a dimness. Before him, it seemed to be all rubble and broken things that could no longer be recognized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Where...where is this? Lornell thought, suddenly remembering the loud noise from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Right, was that an explosion earlier? What exploded? He was playing in the restaurant at the time, and then after the explosion, did it become like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, his body stiffened, feeling a soft presence in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, he couldn't even see clearly what was in his arms, but he had a possible thought in his mind. He thought that what he was holding might be the little guy named Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the explosion occurred, she was right next to him, but... she was lying motionless on top of him. Did she... die?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The thought of this little guy's potential death made him feel uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If only he had told the little one his name... He even thought this to himself, picturing the bright smile on the little one's face that he had seen last.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, suddenly, the little one in his arms let out a whimper, causing Lornell's body to stiffen abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Daddy... Mommy... Harley hurts..." The little one's voice was muffled and filled with tears as he shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The sound made Lornell suddenly breathe a sigh of relief - she's still alive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... your parents are not here," said Lornell. Even though it was just a simple sentence, saying it out loud was more difficult than he had imagined. It was as if every word he spoke brought a physical pain to his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Where are they? I want to find my mommy and daddy," the little one cried with sobs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know where they are... Even if you cry, you can't go find them," he said. He always disliked crying, but for some reason, her crying at the moment didn't make him as averse to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps her crying is reducing the breath of death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What place is this?" asked the little one, with a hint of tears in his voice. However, he listened to her occasional talking, and her voice was smooth. It seemed that when she spoke, she did not feel the pain he was experiencing at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, her injury shouldn't be too serious, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Before... I'm afraid there was an explosion, so we might still be in the restaurant now, or maybe we were blown out of the restaurant. Anyway, we are buried, and it depends on whether we can hold on until someone comes to rescue us," he said.</p></div>
