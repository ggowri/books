        <h1>Chapter 1431</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He apologized to her over and over again, but she just found it ridiculous. He had ruined her life, so it was no use saying sorry now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Kyla, you can beat me, scold me, and punish me however you want, but I just want to make up for what I've done wrong and protect you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She interrupted him abruptly, "Don't go on! How dare you say that? You never believed me when I told you again and again that I didn't push Paisley Daniels down the stairs, but now you do? Is it because you've found out Paisley Daniels wasn't the one who saved you, so you believe that I was wronged? If she were the one who donated you the bone marrow, would you still be acting like this now?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss was stunned. He did not know how to refute her for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin Weiss, you just want to make yourself feel better by telling me all these. You pushed me into prison with your own hands. Nelson also lost his hearing because I caught a fever and was forced to take fever medicine that pregnant women could not take. Do you think your atonement can reverse my imprisonment and give Nelson normal hearing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her question made Martin Weiss stagger a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Her imprisonment was the end of my revenge but the beginning of all her sufferings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What I didn't know was that... Nelson's ears... had something to do with her imprisonment as well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What have I done?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I only find your so-called apology and will to make things up ridiculous. You can never make up for what you&rsquo;ve done!" Kyla Corbyn tried to go past him as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly seized her arm and held her tightly in his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that instant, her whole body seemed to be enveloped by his aura.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She immediately struggled desperately. "Martin Weiss, let go of me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Let go? How can I let go? Does she know how much I long to hold her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All these years, he had been hoping to hold her and go back to the past&mdash;back to the best time they ever had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That period of time was like a gift from fate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even in his sleep, he would always dream of the memories from those days!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had gone missing after she was released from prison, and he had desperately tried to find her. He told himself that it was because he was not done taking revenge one her, but in truth, it was just an excuse he had made to see her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels had kept throwing herself at him and giving him explicit as well implicit hints. He was never once ignorant of these!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He even deliberately tried to get more intimate with Paisley Daniels just to negate some of his fears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was afraid that he still had feelings for Kyla Corbyn, that he would be soft on her, and that he could not help succumbing to her one day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Over the years, he had been in conflict with himself. He was worried and concerned about her but deliberately ignored and hurt her.</p></div>
