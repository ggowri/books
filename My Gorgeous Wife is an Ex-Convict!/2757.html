        <h1>Chapter 2755</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But we're a couple now. Think of it as a gift from me. I&rsquo;ll feel weird if you have to pay for a gift I got for you." Valda Theller insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced at the bracelet on his wrist... 'A gift?' He now had mixed feelings in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He finally said nothing more. Valda Theller paid the bill and looked happily at the bracelet on her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you like the bracelet so much?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled sheepishly. "It's my first time wearing couple bracelets, and it feels new."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you feel?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I feel like I'm not alone anymore," she said. She finally had company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes glimmered slightly. 'Not alone anymore?' He suddenly recalled how the woman beside him always looked optimistic but in truth, she lost her parents when she was little. She was dependent on others until she started university.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, can you wear this bracelet whenever we go on dates? It's a cheap bracelet, but I... think we look more like a couple if we wear the same bracelets," Valda Theller said in anticipation, afraid that he was unwilling to wear the bracelet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, even the button of his shirt probably cost more than the bracelet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm gonna wear it all the time," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She smiled. "Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I need to palter with you?" he asked casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She touched her nose, feeling indescribable delight deep down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the night market, Brian drove Valda Theller back to her apartment. Valda Theller said, "By the way, the gown and jewelry I wore to the banquet last time are still at home. Why don't you wait here for a while? I'll bring them downstairs to return them to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He smiled lightly. "The dress and jewelry are meant for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, no!" She waved her hand quickly. She did not know their real value, but she knew they were worth a lot. "Let me return them to you. I don&rsquo;t usually have a chance to wear them. I don't know what to do with them if you give them to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could you have no chance? Since you intend to continue dating me on the premise of marriage, you'll need the gown and jewelry again. Besides, who do you wish me to give them to if you return them to me?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was rendered speechless instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright. You're my girlfriend, and your boyfriend willingly gave them to you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller blushed. The word &lsquo;willingly&rsquo; made her heart melt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting out of the car, she waved and entered her apartment block. As she got into the elevator, she lifted her hand to gently touch the silver bracelet on her right hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least... it was a good start. They were no longer acting but becoming more and more like a couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe Brian could get over Grace one day and truly accept her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least it was what she expected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, Brian leaned heavily on the back of the chair and closed his eyes. 'This must be what it&rsquo;s like to date.&rsquo; </p></div>
