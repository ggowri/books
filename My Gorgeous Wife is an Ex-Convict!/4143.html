        <h1>Chapter 4141</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Kit was still in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">This woman had rushed in and beaten the person who had been threatening him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though her punches were messy and lacked elegance, and her movements seemed somewhat ridiculous, his heart was being pulled and throbbed violently as if something had grabbed it, almost bursting out of his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">A hint of warmth welled up in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he was in the orphanage and being bullied, he always fantasized that a hero from a fairy tale would come to save him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But no one came, even when he was beaten all over. The hero never came.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Later, as he grew up, he gradually understood that he could only rely on himself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even his father, who shared his blood, even when he became a glamorous idol, even with all his fans, he still had no one to rely on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just now, he had even prepared for the worst, but she appeared like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Like the hero he had longed for in his childhood, punishing the bad guys and protecting him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">His hero, was she actually a princess?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What's wrong? Does it hurt a lot?" The worried voice rang out again, and then a warm hand touched his cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The warm sensation made him feel at ease and brought him back to his senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Tina..." His voice trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she misunderstood and thought he was really in pain. The concern in her eyes grew stronger. "Could it be a bone injury? How could that scum hit you like this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina felt like she didn't hit Mr. Perkins hard enough just now. She should have hit him a few more times!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'll take you to the hospital!" Tina said, placing her hand on Kit's waist, trying to help him stand up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mr. Perkins, who had been beaten down on the ground, now stood up shakily with a swollen face, shouting at Tina, "I'm calling the police! You... even if you're the Stephenson family's daughter, you can't just let this go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina looked worried. She wasn't afraid of him calling the police, but she was afraid that it would attract attention and make today's incident escalate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After all, Kit was a celebrity, and if the outside world found out about this, it would naturally be detrimental to his career, even if he was the victim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">But her silence only made Mr. Perkins more arrogant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If you apologize now, pay for all my medical expenses, and get out of here, then I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Who are you telling to get out?" Suddenly, a cold voice spoke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The three people in the room turned their heads towards the direction of the voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tina saw Chandler walking into the room and was startled. "Why are you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I didn't trust you to come alone, so I followed," Chandler frowned, asking, "What's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Um..." Tina hesitated awkwardly, "This guy hit Kit, so I hit him back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She didn't tell Chandler about the filthy words she heard earlier, after all, it's Kit's privacy, and Kit probably wouldn't want one more person to know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chandler's eyes flickered as he glanced at Kit, whose clothes were slightly disheveled and had obvious signs of being beaten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even though Tina didn't say anything, Chandler could guess roughly what happened. After all, this kind of dirty business is not uncommon in their circle!</p></div>
