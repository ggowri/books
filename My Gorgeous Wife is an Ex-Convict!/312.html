        <h1>Chapter 311</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina blinked. What the... Was he not giving her phone back?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Should I give you some money?" Lina felt stupid when she said this. With his current status, would he care about money?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, he smirked and looked at her as if she was an idiot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then what do you want?" she asked, taking a deep breath. If she did not risk anything, she would risk everything. She guessed he was using the phone to vent his anger on her from more than three years ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would just let him blow off some steam.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you been in a relationship these three years?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shook her head, wondering why he would ask this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then have you ever liked anyone?" he asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were many. If she counted those celebrities she liked with her fingers, her ten fingers would not be enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, facing his expressionless face, she shook her head almost instinctively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Speaking of this, you seem to have said you'd be happy with a boyfriend like me, didn't you?" He added casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She almost choked on her saliva. It was something she said when she was young and foolish! According to Grace, he was now the President of Stephenson Group. The person in charge of the Stephenson family was not someone she could go after.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hehe, you're too kind. I'll be happy with an average boyfriend. I'm not that demanding." She smiled awkwardly, not knowing what she was blabbering on about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glanced at her and said nothing. He kept his head down as he continued to play with her phone and check her web browsing history.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina trembled with fear! She had browsed for some gay fiction last week. She could not let him see that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her hope was quickly shattered when he scrolled through her browsing history from the week before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he clicked on the link to the gay fiction, Lina immediately screamed, "Wait!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" He raised his eyebrows and looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This phone is my privacy. You can't... mess around like this," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Privacy?" He glanced at her. "Why don't you tell me how much of my privacy you invaded back then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She choked and blushed. All right, she was to blame.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... "I didn't force you," she muttered, defending herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You didn't, but you seem to have forgotten what you said. That night, you told me that I was the only one you liked and that you would never like any other man than me. You also said that I was handsome and obedient and that I was the perfect boyfriend for you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blushed a little more with each retelling of the sweet talk she had uttered when she was drunk that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fine, she was really a jerk!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina no longer defended herself and hung her head low. After all, she did utter those words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You also said that you&rsquo;ll love me until the end of time. Have you forgotten that too? The funniest joke in the world probably came out of your mouth that night!" He said as his face came close to hers.</p></div>
