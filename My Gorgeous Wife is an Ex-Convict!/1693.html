        <h1>Chapter 1691</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was instantly stunned. She knew that her son was good with computers, and she also heard Jay say that although their son was young, he was just as good as an adult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... was that something ordinary adults could do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed lifted his chin. His peach-blossom eyes that were similar to Jason's looked at Grace with expectation as though he was waiting for her to praise him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace did not let her son down, of course. She finally managed to restrain her shock. Touching her son's little head, she praised him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed was satisfied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was not surprised that Irene Lynch wanted to harm her. After all, she was already so hostile toward her before this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The police brought Irene Lynch and Damian Harmon back to the police station. Since Grace was also involved, she went to the police station as well to make a statement. Jason followed her there, of course.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace asked the bodyguards to bring their two children and Oriel Lynch back to Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch had been keeping her head down. She said nothing from the moment her mother was taken away by the police. Her little face was ghastly pale, and her two little hands were clutching the hem of her skirt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What do I do? Mommy was taken away by the police, and she was caught doing something bad. Mr. Reed must hate Mommy now. What about me? Will Mr. Reed hate me too? Will I have to stop being Mr. Reed's daughter?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Oriel Lynch was in a panic, and even her thoughts were muddled together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Meanwhile, Jasper was looking around and refusing to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace asked, "What's the matter? Jasper, are you looking for something?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The boy who played the piano has disappeared," Jasper said glumly. She still had a lot to say to him. Besides, she wanted to play the piano with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Um... he plays the piano beautifully. It would be fun to play with him.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had played with other kids before but they could not keep up with her. Big Beard said it was because she was much more talented than them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it would be different if she were to play with that boy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Looking at her daughter's disappointed face, Grace comforted her by saying, "The little boy likes playing the piano very much and he plays it very well. He must have learned to play the piano too. Maybe it won't be long before we meet him again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, they were all in the same circle. It was relatively easy to find a child who could play the piano so well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper cheered up again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The three children were taken away. Grace and Jason got into their car and followed the police car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After these cars had driven off, another car slowly pulled away from the parking lot nearby. The little boy Jasper was looking for was sitting on the passenger seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;&#8203;</span></p></div>
