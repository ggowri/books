        <h1>Chapter 3932</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You lead the way!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As someone who usually held a higher position, his commanding tone made people unconsciously obey.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy obediently led the way with two large plastic bags of groceries, while the driver who stayed behind looked on in surprise as his young master walked into the old apartment building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this really their young master? The one who usually looks down on women outside of the Reed family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now he's carrying groceries for a woman!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If anyone found out, they would be shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Could it be that the young master has taken a liking to this woman? The driver secretly speculated in his heart, but there was no definite answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy brought Mick to her small apartment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The 20-square-meter space, including a bathroom and a kitchen, was already very small, and with Mick there, it became even smaller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Nancy looked at Mick sitting in a chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The dining table in the room was just a small square table with old chairs, but he sat there without giving off any sense of inferiority.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even in such an environment, he gave off a pleasing feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of the surroundings, he became even more visually striking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Would you like some tea?" Nancy asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then...you can sit for a while. It will take some time for the food to be ready," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Mick replied indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was cooking in the kitchen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As it was an open kitchen, Mick could clearly see Nancy skillfully washing and cutting vegetables, and then quickly putting them in the pot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even cooked rice while stir-frying the vegetables.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unlike the glamorous women who usually surrounded him, she gave him a more genuine feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His gaze turned to the small rented room, and finally fell on a black and white photo hanging on the wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The middle-aged woman in the photo had a smile on her lips and a gentle look in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He knew that was Nancy's deceased mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked somewhat similar to her mother, but compared to her mother, she had a stronger sense of determination in her eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But even though she was strong, sometimes she could be surprisingly fragile! Like the last time she appeared in his bedroom in tears in the middle of the night, making him face a woman's crying for the first time and feeling at a loss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even when his own sister cried in front of him, he had never felt so helpless!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Nancy was quick with her hands and feet, it took 40 minutes for the food to be ready.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She lit some incense and candles on the square table and served the food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy held the incense and bowed respectfully three times towards her mother's photo. "Mom, I will be fine, don't worry. Every year from now on, I will come to visit you at your grave. Even if no one else remembers you in this world, I will remember you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She also vowed to seek justice from the Schultz family - a thought she kept to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Nancy finished bowing and placed the incense in the small censer, she heard Mick's voice, "Give me three incense sticks, I want to pay my respects to your mother too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was surprised and looked at Mick in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I came here for this, didn't I?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She then took three incense sticks, lit them, and handed them to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He took the incense and bowed respectfully three times as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy watched the scene before her and felt a sense of absurdity and emotion.</p></div>
