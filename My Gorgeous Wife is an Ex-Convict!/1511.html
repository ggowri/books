        <h1>Chapter 1509</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You&hellip;" Before Brian could speak, Patrick, who had rushed to the scene, quickly pulled on him. He said to Jason, "Jason, I think Brian is drunk, so he's muttering rubbish. Please don't take it by heart."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">As he was speaking, Patrick quickly pulled Brian away from the scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian was not willing to leave. He said to Patrick, "Let go of me! There are still a few things that I need to clarify."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's a rare opportunity that you&rsquo;ve returned to Emerald City, so why even bother with this stuff? Why don&rsquo;t I bring you over to a few fun places in Emerald City?" Patrick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Patrick, please let go of him first. Since he has things to clarify, then allow him to do as he wishes," Jason suddenly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Oh, Lord! Please don't let them both fight it out with each other here!' Patrick sighed. He had no choice but to let go of Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian stared at Jason who was in front of him with a vague smile on his face. He felt that Jason was giving off a vibe that he was unfamiliar with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps the time that went by in the past five years was enough for them to develop a sense of unfamiliarity with each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In these few years, he had intentionally been avoiding Jason. He was afraid that seeing the latter would make him recall things about Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you still love Grace?" Brian hesitated for a moment before asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No," Jason answered straightforwardly. Then, he added casually, "Are you satisfied with this answer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that split second, Brian had no idea how he should answer that question. When Jason said he did not love Grace anymore, his eyes remained so cold as if he would not be bothered by anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jason really&hellip; isn't in love with Grace anymore?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian just stood like a log and was absent-minded. 'What&hellip; What on earth is going on here? What's happening to Jason?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stepped out of the banquet, and Terrence opened the car door with respect. He then followed Jason into the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence had some things to settle. Hence, he was not there to accompany Young master Reed during the banquet earlier. 'However, judging from his expression, it seems like tonight's banquet wasn't pleasant!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence felt perturbed and sat in the front. He tried guessing what had happened at tonight&rsquo;s banquet. 'Did some rich ladies bother Young master Reed again?' Suddenly, he heard a question...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Back then, just how much did I love Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence nearly choked on his saliva and started coughing. Never would he have thought that his boss would suddenly ask such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Er&hellip; About that&hellip; Did someone mention Young Madam&hellip; in front of you?" Terrence asked cautiously. He was observing Young master Reed's expression at that moment through the rear-view mirror of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason, who was sitting in the backseat, was frowning with his eyes lowered. He had on his usual expression, and no one could make out what he was thinking about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I met Brian today. From his expression, it&rsquo;s as if me not loving Grace anymore is something that he finds extremely hard to believe,&rdquo; Jason said casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Indeed&hellip; it's hard to believe!' Terrence said to himself. Thinking back to that year, if he had not been worried about Young master Reed going crazy, he would not have allowed Secretary Wang to&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Despite Jason being able to continue living, he had forgotten about his relationship with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In Terrence's opinion, it seemed that Young master Reed had reverted to the way he was before he got to know Grace. It was like he did not love anyone and no one was able to catch his attention&hellip; 'Oh, wait, there's still an exception.'</p></div>
