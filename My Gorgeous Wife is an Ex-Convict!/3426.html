        <h1>Chapter 3424</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" He was stunned for a moment, as if he didn't expect the topic to suddenly shift to this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A parasite is an animal that lives on or in another animal or plant and feeds on its nutrients, but can harm the host. If we use it to describe a person, it refers to someone who relies on others and doesn't work for themselves!" Veronica spoke with bitterness in her eyes. "And my family and I are like parasites."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she inexplicably wanted to speak out the words that had been suppressed in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She couldn't say these things to Mason or any other classmates, even though she knew they were all talking about the Barlow family. She had been suppressing these thoughts in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After having a conflict with her family today, she suddenly had the urge to confide in Daniel when she saw him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel felt his heart tighten as he saw Veronica's expression, which made him feel a little sorry for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who...who talks about their own family like that?" he asked quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She gave a self-deprecating smile, "There are also many people at school who say that. You must have heard of it too." Even though Daniel had never heard of it before, he must have heard of it after the fight with Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel fell silent immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica said, "This is the truth. My family is indeed a parasite, relying on the Reed family. If Mason wasn't in the Barlow family, our family wouldn't have such a good life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But you definitely aren't," Daniel said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I mean, you definitely aren't a parasite. Even if your family is currently relying on the Reed family, I believe that when you have the ability to work in the future, you will be self-sufficient and not rely on others to get something for nothing!" Daniel said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica paused for a moment and asked, "Do you really think I'm not that kind of person?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right, I believe you're not that kind of person. If you don't believe me, we can make a bet. Let's bet on whether or not you'll be self-sufficient in ten years!" Daniel smiled and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His smile was infectious and it made her feel better. The gloominess that was weighing on her heart seemed to dissipate gradually after talking to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Thank you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you thanking me for? Weren't you the one who came to accompany me to buy sneakers today? I should be the one thanking you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, let's go to the mall now to buy sneakers," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Before we go into the mall... Oh, wait for me here for a moment!" he said, then hurriedly ran off. She only saw him run across the street and into a pharmacy. After a moment, he rushed out of the pharmacy and quickly ran back to her side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's alright, fortunately this ointment is also sold in this pharmacy. You must remember to apply it when you go back!" he said, as he handed her a tube of ointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at the ointment in her hand. It was the same one that he gave her last time, but it was thrown away by Mason into the trash can.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She pursed her lips slightly and said again, "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't keep thanking me all the time, let's go!" he said with a shy smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica couldn't help but smile, and the two of them walked into the mall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the other side, at the Reed family's place, Mason sat in their living room and went with his family to their ancestral hall. There, they paid their respects to the ancestors' tablets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Here are their great-grandfather, great-grandmother, grandfather, and grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">My father rarely comes here, it's always my mother who brings them together.</p></div>
