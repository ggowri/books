        <h1>Chapter 4192 More and More Lies</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit's expression subtly changed. Although he knew she would eventually ask this question, he still wished she would ask it later if possible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Your parents... they... they..." he said several times, but struggled to get the words out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Once one lie is spoken, it often requires more lies to cover it up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And lies, they only multiply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Have they... passed away?" Tina managed to say these words with difficulty. In truth, she had considered this possibility.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If her parents were still alive, they would have searched for her everywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But it was Kit who found her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And after finding her, Kit didn't urgently contact anyone. It could be inferred that her parents were likely no longer alive. Otherwise, why wouldn't Kit help her get in touch with her family after finding her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit pursed his thin lips, remaining silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> To Tina, this silence meant consent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Suddenly, a feeling of discomfort surged within Tina. Although she had lost her memory and didn't remember her parents or what kind of life she had before, she couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It was as if it was telling her how much she had loved her parents in the past!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Seeing Tina in distress, Kit felt a bitter taste in his mouth. Originally, he should have been happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She was rescued and could reunite with her parents immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But now, she felt sad because of his lies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Guilt engulfed him, but he couldn't bring himself to speak the truth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm sorry," Kit muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Bitterly, Tina said, "You have nothing to apologize for, no need to say sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> At night, Kit decided to lie down on the sofa in the guest room. Tina said, "You should sleep on the bed, since there are two beds and it won't affect each other. Besides, we used to be lovers, so... it's not a big deal."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Having even conceived a child, it's clear that they have seen everything there is to see, so there's no need to be shy!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Well... alright," Kit agreed, his ears turning slightly red. "By the way, you should go take a shower first. It'll make you feel more comfortable."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Okay," Tina nodded, but immediately after, she had a troubled look on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What's wrong?" Kit asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I... don't have any clean clothes to change into," she said awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She didn't have many clothes at Drogo's house either. Drogo only prepared two sets of old clothes for her to change into.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And since she escaped, she naturally didn't bring any clothes to change into.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit looked at the tattered clothes Tina was wearing, feeling uneasy. She used to be the envied Miss Stephenson of the Stephenson family, always having the best of everything. But now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You go ahead and shower, I'll go buy some clothes for you," Kit said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'll be back soon! There's a mall right outside, and it's not closed yet!" With that, Kit hurriedly left the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The room was suddenly empty, leaving only Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina lowered her head and looked at her bulging belly. "Baby, your father seems to be impatient, but he's really good. After you're born, he'll definitely like your dad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Then, her belly moved, as if the child inside was responding to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina took off her clothes and turned on the faucet in the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The faucet here was completely different from the ones in the village, but strangely enough, she knew exactly how to use it without anyone teaching her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She must have used a similar faucet before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just then, the sound of the door opening rang out!</p></div>
