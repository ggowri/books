        <h1>Chapter 1055</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way Jason was looking at her somehow gave her a sense of danger. She even... instinctively wanted to run away!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted to run to somewhere so far away where he could not see her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a hand took hers. "Are you scared?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace came back to her senses and realized that Brian was holding her hand. Their hands were shaking slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, it was only her hand that was shaking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I scared? Am I scared of Jason?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't be scared. I'll handle it." Brian's voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath, and the shaking in her hands gradually stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at Jason who was walking toward her step by step. His eyes were fixed on her, his gaze never once leaving. It was as if he was silently telling her that he was here for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No way!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought she must be overthinking. Even if Jason was looking for her, there was no need to make such a big fuss over it. Besides... she had made it very clear to Jason that there was no way she would get back together with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tall figure came up to Grace, and there was a cold chill in his bright eyes. However, his lips were slightly raised in a beautiful arc.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't know you liked these parties. Why are you leaving so early, though? Won't you stay a little longer?" said Jason as he looked at Grace. He spoke so gently that it was as if they were having a casual chat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, a chill ran down Grace's spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were so close that she could easily see the suppressed displeasure in his eyes. She could even sense that he was mad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said aloud, "Jason, what are you doing? Do you have to barricade the place with so many people?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course. Otherwise, with you around, I can't easily take the one I want away," Jason said with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shuddered. 'Am I&hellip; the one Jason wants to take away?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Jason said next seemed to confirm her speculation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You promised to stay with me, yet now you're messing around with another man. It seems that I've been too tolerant of you. Don't you think so, Sis?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; made Grace shudder. Jason was so scary that one could not even guess what he would do next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned, wondering what trick Jason was trying to pull by calling Grace &lsquo;Sis&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... "I won't let you take Grace away," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, Jason did not seem to hear him. His eyes fell on Brian and Grace's clasped hands. He muttered, "How annoying."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, Jason suddenly grabbed Brian's hand. Grace just heard a crack and Brian's hand was immediately twisted unnaturally. Pain flashed across his handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. "Did... Did you break his hand?" She looked at Jason in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The people around him were even more surprised. They had no idea that Master Reed would &lsquo;simply&rsquo; break Young Master Hart's hand.</p></div>
