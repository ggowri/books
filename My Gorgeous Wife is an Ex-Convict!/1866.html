        <h1>Chapter 1864</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, don't overthink it. If it does come to this, I'll help you with the case," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After sending Lina home, Grace dialed a phone number. It was an experienced private detective she knew and also a connection she made when she was a lawyer in L City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Please investigate Katherine Jackson from Jackson Group. I want to know her contact with Hadwin Stephenson after she officially broke up with him at the press conference and what she's doing now," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace needed to look into Katherine Jackson before she could feel at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace did not ask them to look up the whereabouts of her mentor and his wife. If Jay wanted to hide people from others, she would not find anything even if she hired a private detective.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace came to Reed group&rsquo;s building. When she was reaching Jason's office, she saw Terrence walking toward the door with a stack of documents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Terrence!" shouted Grace as she stopped him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence stopped in his tracks and looked at Grace in surprise. "Young... Young Madam? What brings you here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "I'm here to see Jay. Are you going to look for him for work?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence's expression changed slightly. Then, he smiled faintly and said, "It's not urgent. I'll come back to look for Young master Reed later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Terrence turned around to leave, but Grace suddenly pulled on Terrence. "Terrence, how are my mentor and his wife doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Grace pulled him, his hand holding the documents trembled. They instantly fell to the floor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace saw this and quickly said, "I'm sorry." she bent down to pick up the documents on the floor as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence immediately shouted. "It&rsquo;s alright..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it was too late. Grace had already picked up the scattered documents and seen their contents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She stared at the file in her hand. It was a report on her mentor and his wife. It listed the time they ate every day, the time they went to bed, and what they did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was a photo of Mrs. Watts lying on a tattered bed. She did not look very well, and beside it, her temperature was listed as 38.5 degrees!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&lsquo;Is Mrs. Watts having a fever?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Considering that Mrs. Watts had gone through so much after having an operation on her leg and was now living in a seemingly harsh environment, it would be strange if she did not get sick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where are they?" Grace asked Terrence in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence said with a face of reluctance, "Young Madam, I... can't tell you without Young master Reed's permission. If you really want to know, why don't you ask Young master Reed?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace also knew she could not get any answer even if she asked Terrence again, so she turned around and walked into Jason's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the office, Jason was reviewing the documents in his hand. He looked up at Grace after hearing the noise. "What are you doing here?"</p></div>
