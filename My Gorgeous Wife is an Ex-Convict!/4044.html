        <h1>Chapter 4042</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong?" a voice asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy turned abruptly and realized that they were alone in the dressing room. Everyone else had left without her noticing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just feel like I'm dreaming," she said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What feels like a dream? Our wedding, being married to me, or falling in love with me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"All of it, and the fact that you love me too. It all feels like a dream," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's not a dream! And don't you dare think it is!" Mick held Nancy's face in his hands. "I love you because you're worth loving. I only regret that I didn't realize it sooner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If only he had understood his feelings earlier, would she have suffered less?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was my mistake back then," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shouldn't have taken advantage of his feelings for her just to seek revenge for her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, his subsequent coldness towards her was her own fault.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let's not dwell on the past," Mick said. "Thank you for marrying me and giving me such a lovely daughter."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her response was a passionate kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The wedding begins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the eldest son of the Reed family, the wedding is naturally grand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Most of the guests present are also well-known celebrities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kind of scene is probably hard to come by on a regular basis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy holds the bouquet and walks step by step towards Mick on the stage in the banquet hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He is the man she loves, the man who is willing to give everything to love her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mother, can you see me now? I am doing well and I am happy!" Nancy silently says in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mother passed away unexpectedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, the Schultz family, who had buried the truth about her mother's death, has also been punished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her mother can now rest assured and leave peacefully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick stands on the stage in the banquet hall, looking at Nancy with a gentle expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she approaches him, he reaches out his hand to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy walks up to Mick and places her hand in his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He takes her hand and they approach the officiant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I, Mick, will love Nancy for the rest of my life, through thick and thin, and she will be the only one for me!" Mick speaks his wedding vows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although it was short, no one would question the authenticity of his oath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">People like him, once they make a promise, always keep their word!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I, Nancy, will love Mick for the rest of my life, never leaving or abandoning him, he is the only one for me!" Nancy made the same oath, but added one more sentence at the end, "Being able to spend my life with you is the greatest happiness for me, I love you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After saying this, Nancy tiptoed and hugged Mick's neck, kissing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick naturally held her waist and kissed her back passionately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Anyone could see the love between the two.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the newlyweds bowed to their elders, Mick and Nancy also bowed deeply to Miss Fowler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This bow was to thank Miss Fowler for saving Nancy and her unborn child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This bow represented that Miss Fowler was like family to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This bow also showed everyone that this old woman had a high status in the Reed family.</p></div>
