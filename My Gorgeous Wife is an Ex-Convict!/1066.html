        <h1>Chapter 1065</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said imperiously, "Whether it's your words or your heart, I want you to love me! Even if your heart doesn't love me, sooner or later, you'll love me as much as you did before. Grace, take my word for it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice sounded so confident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All her blood seemed to be frozen! 'Is it possible? Can I still love him like before?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could a broken relationship go back to the way it used to be?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the night descended, Martin Weiss got in the car and somewhat tiredly rubbed his forehead. He had been talking to the lawyer about the custody case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lawyer he hired was naturally an expert on such cases. Upon analyzing the case, he told him that he had at least an 80 percent chance of winning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the child had lived with Kyla Corbyn for years, Kyla Corbyn's biggest disadvantage was her time in prison. Her record would give the judge a high chance of awarding him custody.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had no idea that the case would become a weapon in the custody battle. Martin Weiss's eyes could not help darken at the thought of the case.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart seemed to ache again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Stop it!' he said to himself. He did what he had to do when he testified against Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It was Kyla Corbyn who maliciously pushed Paisley down the stairs. I merely said what I saw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla Corbyn deserved it! Paisley not only lost her baby but also the ability to conceive because of that push.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Therefore, it's only natural to let Paisley raise Kyla Corbyn's child! Kyla Corbyn should pay for the crimes she committed!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... the scene of the woman insisting she was innocent in court lingered in his mind like an imprint!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Kyla Corbyn was sentenced to three and a half years in prison because of that case, Kyla Corbyn never pleaded guilty in court!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when the judge read the verdict in court, she still insisted she was innocent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was taken away by the bailiff, she had looked at him coldly and said in a sarcastic voice, "Martin Weiss, I hope there will come a time when you'll face such an inexcusable situation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Inexcusable? That's just her excuse!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Weiss, do you want to return to the hotel now?" asked the driver in the front seat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was about to reply, but he said, "Go to Huaihai Road."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huaihai Road?" The driver was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." With that, Martin Weiss slowly closed his eyes and stopped talking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver then turned around and headed in the direction of Huaihai Road.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people would set up stalls at Huaihai Road at night. Locals would come here to eat, but people like Martin Weiss seemed to have nothing to do with a place like this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver wondered why Martin Weiss wanted to come to Huaihai Road. 'Is it because he wants to have a late-night supper?&rsquo;</p></div>
