        <h1>Chapter 3741</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Veronica went to work at the brokerage company in the afternoon, the manager of the personnel department said to her, "Veronica, there's a new employee today. Can you introduce him to the company and your usual work? He'll be working with you later."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Working with her, so he's also a part-time assistant?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay!" Veronica agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when she saw the new employee, she was stunned.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Daniel, and if this was a coincidence, then the world was too small.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mr. Cross?" Veronica exclaimed, "What are you doing here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I haven't found a suitable job yet, so I'm working part-time here," Daniel smiled, "But it's really a coincidence that you're here too."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What about your delivery job?" Veronica asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I quit. I couldn't juggle both jobs, so I quit the delivery job," Daniel replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But why did you think of working at a brokerage company? It's not related to your major," Veronica asked in confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's not related, but at least I can gain some work experience. And the assistant position I applied for seems to require a bit of everything, so maybe I can learn a lot here. And if I can also make some connections, that would be even better," Daniel explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let me introduce you to the job here first," Veronica said to her senior.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't call me 'senior' anymore. We're colleagues now. If you keep calling me that, it'll be awkward in the office. Just call me by my name instead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Call him by his name? Veronica didn't like the idea at first, but she realized that calling him 'senior' in the office might not be appropriate. So she compromised and </span><span>said, "Okay, Daniel."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel smiled, "Veronica, it's been years since I heard you call me that. It feels good, like going back to the old days."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt uneasy, as if there was some hidden meaning behind his words. Maybe she was overthinking it. She thought to herself that she had already made it clear to him last time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just a normal name. Don't people around you call you by your name?" Veronica asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"They do, but it feels different," Daniel replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's talk about work first, or you might have trouble later," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," Daniel agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica introduced Daniel to his work and showed him around the company.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's about it. HR will prepare your desk soon. If you have any questions, you can come to me. I have other work to do now, so I'll leave first," Veronica said before turning around and leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Daniel watched Veronica's back as the smile on his face gradually faded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coming here to work was just the first step. His whole life was ruined because of his relationship with Veronica years ago.</span></p></div>
