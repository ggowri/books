        <h1>Chapter 3831</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Archer and Rosalind left, Veronica went back to the hospital after packing her things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason was sitting on the hospital bed talking on the phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But he was speaking in a foreign language, and Veronica didn't understand what he was saying at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, the only foreign language she knew was English.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Mason finished his call, Veronica asked, "Who were you talking to just now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was talking to the person in charge at the school," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"School? Stanford University?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it's the school I was originally attending. I had planned to return there in two months, but since I'm not planning to go back now, there are some things I need to take care of," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica's face lit up. "So you'll complete your studies </span><span>domestically</span><span>?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Mason replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's great!" she exclaimed, but then she seemed to remember something. "Will you still go abroad for further studies in the future?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if I do, I'll go with you! If you don't want to go </span><span>abroad, then we'll just stay here together</span><span>," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica felt a wave of sweetness in her heart. "We'll be together in the future and won't be separated, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise?" he looked at her. "Did you forget what you promised me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His voice, once cold, now seemed a bit dangerous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't forget, of course not!" Veronica quickly said, leaning in to kiss Mason's cheek. "I love you so much, how could I bear to be separated from you? I just wanted to confirm it because I was afraid you might forget."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed that since they had opened up to each other after experiencing life and death together, she had become bolder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason's cheek turned red, and he stared at Veronica. "You--" but his tone was no longer dangerous. Instead, he seemed a bit confused and cute.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This kind of Mason made Veronica unable to resist teasing him. After all, she hadn't seen him look so cute in a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you like it when I kiss you?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pursed his lips and gave her a white look. "Why are you asking this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you like it, I can kiss you more in the future. Of course, if you don't like it, I'll try to be careful not to make you unhappy," she said, her eyes shining.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This expression clearly shows that they are watching their prey fall into a trap.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason remembered when they were younger, sometimes Veronica would tease him just for fun, enjoying the sight of his blushing face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he knew she was teasing him, he would still go along with it, obediently answering and blushing. And when he saw her smiling face, he felt warm inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"&hellip;I like you." His thin lips spoke the truth, and his cheeks turned even redder.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She gazed at his increasingly crimson cheeks, unable to resist reaching out and gently cupping his face. "Our Mason is becoming more and more handsome."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You...like me?" He whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course I do. From the first time you came to my house when we were kids, I thought you were very cute, like a doll. Back then, I even wanted to dress you up in a little dress and put your hair in pigtails to make you look even cuter." She said.</span></p></div>
