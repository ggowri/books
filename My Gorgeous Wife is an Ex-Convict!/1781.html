        <h1>Chapter 1779</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If I can't play the piano, is Jasper... going to stop liking me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He seemed to want to play the piano for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The Reed family had suppressed the news, so Lina had no idea that Grace found her child&mdash;let alone that the child was kidnapped and her best friend almost died!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina only found out about everything after calling Jason on the phone because she could not get through to her best friend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She hurriedly took the day off and rushed to the hospital Grace was admitted to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, your hands..." Lina immediately froze at the sight of her best friend's bandaged hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After learning that her best friend would be undergoing an operation for her hands in a few days and the success rate of the operation was very low, Lina gasped sharply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What if... the operation fails..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That means I can't do anything with them anymore, but... even if I can't use my hands, I still have my mouth and feet. Aren't there a lot of devices that use voice functions these days? I can still do a lot of things without my hands. Don't be so worried. It's not as bad as you think," Grace smiled and said nonchalantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Isn't this... an extremely bad situation?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Lina knew that her best friend did not want her to worry so much! Therefore, she smiled and said, "The operation will be successful! I'm sure of it. After your successful operation, let's go for drinks and karaoke!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay!" Grace said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hold on... Not drinking." Lina suddenly thought of how she had slept with Hadwin Stephenson after drinking previously and immediately changed her mind, saying, "We'd better just play the finger guessing game and karaoke. We should stop drinking so much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace smiled. "What's the matter? Are you scared of getting drunk?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina laughed dryly and quickly changed the subject, saying, "By the way, when I called Jason earlier, he said that the child named Mason is the one you lost. What... What a coincidence!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"He is." Grace herself lamented the magic of fate, not expecting that the child she helped back then was her own son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But the boy isn't very amiable. Does he accept you as his parents?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace shook her head. "No, but I'm sure he'll accept us one day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was about to speak when a feeling of nausea suddenly came over her. She quickly got up and rushed to the bathroom in the ward. She leaned over the sink and threw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">From her hospital bed outside, Grace could hear the sound of vomiting coming from the bathroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After a while, Lina came out of the bathroom. She looked a little pale, and her voice had a touch of exhaustion. "Sorry, my stomach hasn&rsquo;t been feeling very well these days. I have no appetite and keep throwing up. I'll buy some medicine later."</p></div>
