        <h1>Chapter 1721</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, Grace followed Lina into the nightclub, and Lina asked for ten male escorts to entertain her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, they thought she was here to cause trouble! Even the manager came out to get rid of them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the manager instantly got rid of that idea when he saw Grace. He quickly got ten of the most attractive male escorts in the nightclub to entertain them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The manager was now standing miserably at the door of the private room. He looked at the closed door, praying that the two people in the private room would leave as soon as they had enough fun.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Who would have thought one of the two women asking for ten male escorts was the mistress of Reed group?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The manager had seen a video of Grace online before, so he had an impression of her. However, the video was taken down a short while later!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Well... I wonder if Young master Reed knows that his wife is in a place like this! If he does...' The manager could not help trembling at the thought of this. The nightclub would probably cease to exist in Emerald City by then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He only wished that the two people would quickly leave after enjoying themselves so that he could pretend nothing had ever happened!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, an internal call told him that he could not get what he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Manager Wang, Young... Young master Reed is here..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young master Reed?!" The manager was surprised. There was only one person in Emerald City who was called Young master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yeah, he... He's here. He's heading straight for the private room, and his expression doesn't look too good!" they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Manager Wang's heart sank. The next moment, he saw a tall figure coming this way and stopping at the door of the private room. "Are they in there?" Jason asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Manager Wang quickly bent over and said, "Yes... Mrs. Reed and her friend are... both inside..." As he spoke, Manager Wang felt his forehead and palms breaking out in a cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was expressionless. He was about to open the private room door when Manager Wang quickly said, "Young master Reed, inside the room..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason glanced coldly at Manager Wang. "What about it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Manager Wang's mind instantly went blank. The only thought that crossed his mind was that today would be the end of his life if there was something going on inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"N-Nothing..." stammered Manager Wang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason turned the door handle with his fingers, and Lina's voice instantly sounded from inside. "Drink... Drink again. Whoever doesn't finish these drinks today... is a bastard!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason saw Lina drinking with a row of men who were all dressed differently, while Grace was asking her to stop drinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was obviously drunk. She could hardly stand on her feet and was stammering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace seemed quite sober though.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, there you are!" Grace greeted Jason when she saw that he had arrived. "Lina's drunk. Help me send Lina home later!"</p></div>
