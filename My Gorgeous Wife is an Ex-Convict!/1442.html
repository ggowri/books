        <h1>Chapter 1441</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, she only came from an ordinary family. Although they were doing okay, had some money, and her husband was also the head of a department, they were nothing compared to Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If Martin Weiss really sued them, her family would land themselves in serious trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had intended to embarrass Kyla Corbyn by attracting the attention of the other parents around her, but judging from the gazes around her, she had become the clown instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The woman was ashamed, afraid, and anxious. She could only say aggrievedly, "I... I'm sorry. I was talking without thinking just now. Don't mind me, Mr. Weiss!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Not to me. Apologize to my son and..." He paused and hesitated a little before saying, "...the mother of my son!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, he did not even know how to describe his relationship with Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The woman's face was full of shame, and she only wished that she could leave soon. Hence, she quickly said to Kyla Corbyn and Nelson Corbyn, "I'm sorry. I was just talking nonsense. It's all nonsense. I... I apologize. I won't speak like that again. Please forgive me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, the woman hurriedly dragged her son away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked down and said to Nelson, "Let's go home. Grandma's waiting at home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mommy, what's a bastard?" the little one asked such a question all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn froze, while Martin Weiss looked stunned. A hint of pain flashed across his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before Kyla Corbyn could answer, Martin Weiss was already saying, "Nelson, I'm sorry. It's all my fault, but you're no bastard. You're my only child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The little one just pressed his lips together tightly and glared at Martin Weiss. The little one still remembered what Martin Weiss had said in the park.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing his son's hostility, Martin Weiss could not help but take two steps forward. "Nelson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mommy, let's go home." The little one turned his head, seemingly not wanting to talk to Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Since Daddy hates me, scolded Mommy, and even made her sad, I won't like him anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I'm content with having myself, Mommy, and Grandma as my family. I don't need a daddy!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing his son's attitude, a hint of sadness flashed across Martin Weiss's eyes. 'What can I say? I brought this upon myself.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing that Kyla Corbyn was about to leave with Nelson, Martin Weiss suddenly ran up after them and said, "Kyla, I'll help you reverse your case. I'll prepare the relevant evidence and won't let you bear the identity of a convict. No one can criticize you for that ever again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What happened today had stung him like nothing he ever experienced before, and he regretted it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The case had been nothing but revenge for him, and all he had thought about at the time was putting her in prison for three and a half years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He even thought that the Corbyn family's daughter had been punished too lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However... now he realized that it was more than three and a half years in prison. The criminal record and the identity of a convict would affect Kyla Corbyn her whole life and even their child.</p></div>
