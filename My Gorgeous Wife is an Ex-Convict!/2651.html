        <h1>Chapter 2649</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, Valda Theller looked at Brian bitterly and said, "Sorry for getting you involved."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing to me. Besides, I was the one who proposed that we date," said Brian as he glanced at Valda Theller out of the corners of his eyes. "But how can you be so sure that I'm someone serious about my relationships? Maybe our relationship is just a game to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "If it were only a game, you wouldn't have warned me not to love you in the first place. I remember you saying a person's love isn't deep if they can withdraw it easily when we first met, so I figured that you must have loved someone deeply before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his lips together tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller let out a breath and said, "If I was wrong, I can only blame myself for judging you wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The traffic light happened to turn red, and the car stopped in front of the zebra crossing. Brian turned his head and looked at Valda Theller. His thin lips said, "Do you really think you can see through me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked up and gazed at the man in front of her. His angular face and delicate facial features could attract people's attention easily. However, the aura he exuded seemed to distance himself from others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That faint estrangement would only disappear in the presence of the woman named Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those phoenix eyes seemed to contain all the splendor of the world and the calm sea. No one knew if it was turbulence or calmness underneath them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said honestly, "I can't, but at least I know you're not a fraud."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What makes you so sure I'm not a fraud?" he asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else could it be? What are you trying to get out of me? Money or sex?" Valda Theller touched her nose and said in self-mockery, "If you were trying to get money out of me, your car is worth more than everything I have. There's nothing you can get out of me. And I feel sorry for you if you want to get sex out of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Haha!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was amused. It was the first time a woman had said so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what she said had lightened the mood in the car. "Alright. If you have any problems while we're in this relationship, I'll help you settle them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The statement was tantamount to a promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyone would be elated to get a promise like that from the crown prince, but Valda Theller quickly said, "No thanks..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't get ahead of yourself. Maybe you'll encounter some trouble that you can't solve in the future," said Brian as he turned back and looked straight ahead again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The red light had turned green, so he started driving again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where do you want to go next?" Brian asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Where to go...' Valda Theller looked at the scenery along the way and suddenly said, "Why don't we... go to a bar?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A bar? Do you want to drink?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, no, it's my new book. The protagonist is a bar owner, but it's been years since I went to a bar. I don't know what bars look like now, so I want to check one out. Of course, we can go somewhere else if you don't want to. I'll just ask Camille to accompany me the next time."</p></div>
