        <h1>Chapter 3710</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was lost in thought. In fact, she had asked herself the same question countless times over the years.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had accepted his confession of love back then, would everything be different? There would be no misunderstandings, no separation, and he wouldn't have chosen hypnosis.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had always been the most important person to her, the one she was willing to depend on. In the Barlow family, she never felt like she belonged, she never felt like it was her home, but... Mason was different!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was her true family, the only one she had in her heart! For him, she could give up everything! And she knew he felt the same way back then!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They were each other's most important person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always seen him as a little brother and never thought about being with him as anything else.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or perhaps, in her subconscious, her views on love and marriage were not necessarily long-lasting. Like her parents, after her mother died, her father quickly found a stepmother. All the promises he made to her mother were just a joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had also dated before, but that relationship ended abruptly. Of course, part of the reason her relationship ended was because of Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even without Mason's interference, her relationship with Daniel wouldn't have lasted long. Perhaps when there were some changes in the wind, or conflicts of interest, Daniel and Grace would choose their family over her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So looking back, her first love was just a childish game.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lovers can be replaced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But family cannot be replaced. The bond of family can last forever.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So at that time, she didn't want to change her relationship with Mason!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when she found out that Mason's liking for her had turned into romantic love, she avoided it and didn't want to face it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she never thought that her avoidance would only make the distance between them grow further.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she had a chance to choose again, would she still avoid it? Or would she try to accept him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I don't know," Veronica murmured her thoughts, "I don't know if I will fall in love with you, or if I can stop seeing you as a little brother, but...I think I will try to understand you and see if there is another possibility between us besides siblings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, it's too late to say these things. It may even be meaningless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Time cannot be turned back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So let's try," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was stunned. "What...try?" What was he talking about? Could it be what she was thinking?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's try to see if there is another possibility between us besides siblings," Mason said. "I can give you a chance to try. If it turns out that there is no such possibility, then we will go our separate ways. I will give you some money and you can leave Emerald City and never appear in front of me again."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was shocked and trying to digest what he had just said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So...what if that's a possibility?" she murmured after a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then we'll date, and I'll choose to lift the hypnosis," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lift the hypnosis?" She blinked, not understanding.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The hypnosis makes me forget the emotions from this period of my past, but it doesn't mean they can't be restored. Before the hypnosis, a secret phrase is set, and that phrase can lift the hypnosis," he explained.</span></p></div>
