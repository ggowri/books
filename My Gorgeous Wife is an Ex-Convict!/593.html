        <h1>Chapter 592</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Help me? Those two words coming out of your mouth make me sick!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The people around them were professional lawyers, not idiots. How could they not sense something when they heard this? Immediately, the way they looked at Andrea Schwartz changed. It was certain that Andrea Schwartz's reputation was ruined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz had wanted to embarrass Grace today so that she could vent her mortified feelings after meeting Grace during her medical examination at the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that the person being embarrassed now was herself?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At once, without thinking, she picked up a cup of tea in front of her and threw it at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace managed to avoid getting splashed on her face as she already had her defenses up and stepped back in time, but the upper half of her clothes was not spared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the weather was hot, Grace wore nothing more than a white shirt. It was now wet from the tea and her undergarment beneath was visible.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz's colleagues did not expect her to do that all of a sudden. Some of them let out an immediate exclamation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While Grace made a conscious effort to cover her chest, a thin suit jacket covered her body in the next moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Put it on!" A voice rang in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. This voice was... She turned her head, and the indifferent, delicate face caught her eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Brian!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His brows were slightly furrowed, and there was a hint of anger in his deep phoenix eyes. It surprised her a little. After all, more often than not, he looked as if he were indifferent to everything around him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not expect Brian to be here, but the suit jacket certainly hid her embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was accompanied by the law firm's boss and two lawyers from the firm, one of whom led Grace when she joined the firm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, he looked at Grace with a mixed look in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's this?" The boss snapped. It was obviously not a nice thing to happen in front of one of the firm's biggest clients.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz, who looked angry earlier, started to panic. "No&hellip; Nothing. I just missed and accidentally spilled tea on Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian snorted coldly. "Were you careless, or was it on purpose?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was even a sharp glimmer in his phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea Schwartz's face went red. "It's... It's..." She wanted to insist that she was careless, but the words seemed stuck in her throat as she looked into his cold phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The boss looked around, then asked the others, "Tell me, what's going on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A colleague, who was also in the general room and had joined the firm around the same time as Grace, gave a rough account of what happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the mention of Andrea Schwartz asking Grace to give details of her case to the rookies, Brian's eyes flickered slightly. His eyes turned to Grace's slightly pale cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stood a little awkwardly while draped in his suit. Her pale face and even her lips looked a little bloodless, making her almond-shaped eyes appear startlingly black in comparison.</p></div>
