        <h1>Chapter 539</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was relieved when she saw this. She was worried that Nelson was too young to watch the movie and would be bored. She even decided that if Nelson really could not understand the movie and did not want to stay here, she would carry him out of the auditorium.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, it was a happy ending for all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was finally able to focus on the film.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She must admit that the film was really good. The cast fitted their roles in the film, and the special effects were done beautifully. The plot was simple, but it did not feel dull.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Howell Webb was no longer being typecast, which was a transition for him and a challenge for his acting skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked on and thought Howell Webb performed well in the film.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After watching the emotional climax scene, Grace even burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even she was surprised when the tears came. She was not much of a crybaby. In the past, when Lina would cry her eyes out during a movie, she did not even shed a tear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she would be moved by the film, she did not cry much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was now crying, partly because the film did great in making people emotional and partly because she seemed to see herself in the character.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had gone from ordinary to someone with a bright future, but before she reached the peak, she was shot down into the darkest of places. She was now on her own, stepping into the light again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although all this was done humorously in the film, the pain still left Grace with a sense of empathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was about to take a tissue to wipe away her tears, a hand touched her face first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Long fingers wiped away her tears. "Why are you crying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No... Nothing. It's just a little too touching," said Grace, sniffling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Seeing you cry like this makes me regret taking you to see this movie." He frowned a little. He did not like to see her tears because they would give him some kind of heartache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she said it was because the film was touching, he still did not like her to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I cried because it was a good movie. I laughed and cried." Grace explained, trying to wipe away her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, he pressed her hand, and his face came close to hers while his lips kissed the tears on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. "Jay..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't move," he muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Some&hellip; Someone will see," she whispered. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lights were off here in the auditorium. The only light source was the big screen in front. It was dark all around, so no one would probably notice them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However&hellip; It was probably inevitable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you don't want people to see us, you should stay still," he muttered, kissing away the tears from her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tears were so salty to him.</p></div>
