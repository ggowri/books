        <h1>Chapter 763</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Nothing could happen to her! Absolutely nothing could happen to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'll find her no matter what!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about the nearby surveillance? Have you found anything?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're still working on it. We should have something soon," Terrence said hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, there was surveillance on several roads around here. If Miss Cummins had left this area, the surveillance cameras would have filmed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the surveillance reported that only 13 cars had gone in and out and several pedestrians passing by during this period.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This area was one of the more remote parts of the town, so not many would have come in or out of here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had checked out the owners of these cars. They were all innocent town residents, and they had no criminal records as well as nothing to do with Miss Cummins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for those who passed by, they did not find Miss Cummins among them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was to say, Miss Cummins was probably still on this hill. It was just that the hills were all connected, and it would be a bit of a hassle to find her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence looked at his boss, waiting for his command.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A moment later, Terrence only saw his thin lips spitting out six words in a cold voice, "Put these hills on lockdown and search for her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Reed, won't this be too much?" He reminded him. After all, Miss Cummins had only been out of touch for two hours so far. What if Grace just got lost?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, Terrence continued saying, "How about we send more troops up the hill to look for Miss Cummins? As for putting the hills on lockdown&ndash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Put these hills on lockdown!" said Jason as he interrupted Terrence with no room for judgment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even with all the noise and trouble, he did not want to leave out any possibilities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence knew his boss had already decided, so he did not say anything more. He just began to arrange the manpower and ask for support from the local police at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It only took a moment and the troops that were going up the hills were ready to go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason wanted to go up the hill with one of the troops to find Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Reed, you might as well wait down the hill," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to find her!" said Jason, 'I won't be at ease until I find her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The troop Jason chose was going to the very hill where Grace had saved Brian's life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stared at the forest. 'Somehow, I have a feeling that Grace might be on this hill.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, this hill was close to the one where her grandmother was buried, and the two hills were connected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, there was a faint worry in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">According to the surveillance, Brian&hellip; Was one of the people who passed by.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Brian came here as well! Could he have gone up this hill too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'After all, Brian has memories of this hill! Would the two of them&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a moment, he dared not think about it anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He knew about this place's existence when he investigated her past with Brian.</p></div>
