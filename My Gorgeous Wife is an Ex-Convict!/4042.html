        <h1>Chapter 4040</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Good, don't cry, don't cry, here, baby, have a drink."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, a woman's voice whispered, "What's wrong with the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing, just hungry, drinking now, you go back to sleep." The voice was so gentle that it seemed like it could melt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, the subordinate on the other end of the phone felt shocked and overwhelmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Can he really believe what he's hearing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Quickly, what's the matter so late at night?" Mick's voice became cold again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The subordinate finally regained his senses and reported the emergency situation, waiting for his boss's instructions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the call ended, the subordinate felt like he had just had a dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even the Reed family was surprised by Mick's transformation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, it was hard to imagine the cold-faced Mick taking care of a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason and Veronica also often brought their daughter to the Reed House.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Their daughter Pearl is now three years old. Every time she comes to the Reed family mansion, she likes to squat next to Sophia and look at the little sister from left to right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even touches the little sister with her hand, imitating the adults, gently patting her when the baby cries, and occasionally saying, "Good girl, don't cry, little sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's very amusing to the adults.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pearl even solemnly tells Mason and Veronica, "I'm going to be a big sister in the future, and I will protect my little sister!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you sure you can protect your little sister?" Veronica chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The little one lowered his head, as if thinking hard, and then said, "I'm still too young now, so Mommy and Daddy help me protect my sister. When I grow up, I'll be able to protect her myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What would you do if someone bullied your little sister when you grow up?" Veronica asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I would reason with him," Pearl replied seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if he doesn't listen to reason?" Jasper asked on the side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pearl raised her little fist, "I'll show him how tough I am! Auntie, I'm really tough!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, she even demonstrated a few moves. It was quite impressive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper glanced at the little one and turned to Veronica, whispering, "Did Pearl deliberately learn these moves from someone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, she didn't deliberately learn them. Sometimes Mason tells Pearl how to fight back if she's ever bullied by other kids," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I see. Can you...uh, understand Pearl's moves?" Jasper asked cautiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's just a child, her strokes are messy. Is there anything special about it? But I think it's good for girls to know some self-defense moves, so they won't be defenseless if they encounter a bully," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Has she ever used these moves against any other kids?" Jasper continued to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, Mason told her not to use them unless it's absolutely necessary. And so far, there haven't been any bullies around her. She gets along well with other kids in kindergarten," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she had only learned a few basic moves, it didn't stop her from having a good eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason teaching Pearl these moves was not just for self-defense. It was more than that...if anyone dared to bully Pearl, they would be in big trouble.</p></div>
