        <h1>Chapter 2436</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The woman also seems close with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it possible? Could the woman be the one who took Amber Mitchell away?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Louise Mitchell shuddered and looked up to see a figure standing at the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was surprised. When did he push the door open? She didn't even realize it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She and George Gregory had been sleeping in separate beds after they got married. Although they were newlyweds, they slept in two rooms. It was humiliating to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had to pretend that they were sleeping in separate rooms because she wanted some privacy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only she knew it was actually because George Gregory had not fully accepted her, so he requested to sleep in separate rooms. It was as if he was silently telling her that she would never be able to win his heart. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he suddenly appeared in her doorway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who disappeared and was taken away?" George Gregory asked Louise Mitchell with a cold expression and an equally cold voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I-It&rsquo;s nothing. It's just a small matter. I'll send someone to take care of it," Louise Mitchell replied as she forced herself to be calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory walked slowly into the room and approached Louise Mitchell step by step. "Who's gone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The inquiry was more like an interrogation. She had a feeling that he had figured something out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's lips quivered slightly before finally uttering the word, "Sis".</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory pursed his thin lips for a moment before saying, "Isn't she in the hospital? How could she be gone?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My... My parents and I want to transfer her to another hospital, but I brought her to the mansion first because the procedures in the new hospital haven't been done yet. I didn't expect someone to take her away." Louise Mitchell told a mixture of truth and lies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's expression changed. "Why is she being transferred all of a sudden? Why didn't you mention this to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't like to hear me talk about my sister, so I didn&rsquo;t mention her," said Louise Mitchell. How could she mention her? She hoped he would forget Amber Mitchell once and for all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's expression became ghastly. Who would take Amber Mitchell away? For some reason, Martin Weiss and Kyla, who had come to his company earlier, came to mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman had claimed to be Amber Mitchell's friend. Could she have asked Martin Weiss to take Amber Mitchell away?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Louise Mitchell's voice rang in his ears again when he was thinking about it. "I figured out who might have taken Sis. It might be Grace, the lawyer I met at the party earlier. She seemed close with Brian and had spoken with Whitney Herrera, the mistress of the Moss family. She must&rsquo;ve wanted to learn about Sis and the Moss family from Whitney Herrera. Grace also went to the hospital to see Sis with two other people!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell spoke as she pretended to be worried, "I'm so worried about Sis. I'm afraid Sis will fall into their hands. What will they do to Sis? They claim to be Sis' friends, but come to think of it, Sis has been sick for so many years yet they never showed up. It's pretty suspicious that they showed up all of a sudden..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"the Moss family..." George Gregory's voice was cold. Amber Mitchell was a taboo topic for him, and the Moss family was another one. </p></div>
