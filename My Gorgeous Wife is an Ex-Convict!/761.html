        <h1>Chapter 760</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm heavy, aren't I?" the little boy asked with some embarrassment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, you're quite heavy," the little girl said rudely. Every step was so difficult.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry... You had to carry me. However&hellip; However, if you get hurt in the future, I'll certainly carry you!" There was a note of eagerness in the little boy's voice as if he was afraid that the little girl would dislike him for his uselessness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How long can you carry me for? What if you won't be able to carry me?" The little girl did not seem to believe in the little boy's strength. He was older than her, but he seemed to need her protection all the way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I could carry you forever!" the little boy blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the little boy and little girl did not know what forever meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The broken images combined and became a vivid memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt drowsy and tried to open her eyes, but it was as if her eyes could not open at all. Her body seemed to move from side to side, swaying slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's as if... Someone is carrying me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who is it? Who's carrying me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Bryn..." When the whisper unconsciously came out of her mouth, Brian, who was carrying her on his back, was shocked and stopped immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she was calling out was... His nickname.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why did she call out that name when he had forbidden it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This woman was always trying her best to distance herself from him but would occasionally act strangely. Why was that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, listen to me if you're awake. You can call me anything you want, but only 'Bryn' is not something you can call me!" Brian said coldly and began to resume his pace, walking down the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only heard a voice ringing in her ears... 'Whose voice is it? Who's speaking? Who's carrying me on their back?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She opened her eyes with some difficulty, and what came into sight were broad shoulders and a gracefully curved neck. 'It's... Brian!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked and suddenly stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You woke up?" Brian's voice rang again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She calmed herself down before replying, "Yes." Then, she asked, "What... Happened to me just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You kept screaming in pain and passed out. Is it your headache again? Didn't Jason take you to the doctor?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He remembered that she had had a headache the last time they were at the fair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I plan to go back to the doctor sometime later," said Grace, still a little muddled in the head, but she knew she did not have to go back to the doctor again. In the future... She should no longer have any headaches from the stimulation of her memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was because&hellip; She remembered it all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered how she met him, the time they spent in the hills, and how she carried him down the hill and took him to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought they would meet again soon after he recovered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, who would have thought that &lsquo;soon&rsquo; took nearly 20 years?</p></div>
