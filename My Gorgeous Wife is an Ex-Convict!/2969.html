        <h1>Chapter 2967</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was stunned for a moment. It was only right to meet his parents, but she couldn't help feeling nervous and worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? Are you afraid to see them?" Brian asked. "You already met them once at the hospital before, so why be afraid?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just worried about what if they're not satisfied with me?" Valda said. Sometimes, she felt insecure because they were like two people from different worlds. Someone like him, who was a prodigy, should have been matched with those high-born ladies. However, she was just an orphan girl with no parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That is, unless they want their son to never get married or have children in his lifetime," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm serious," she muttered, thinking he was joking with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm serious too," Brian said. "They will only like you and not be dissatisfied with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But she still looked worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He touched her head. "Valda, you should have more confidence in yourself. You are not inferior to anyone. Besides, you are the woman I like. If you think you are not good enough, does that mean my taste is bad?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words made her feel less anxious than before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You are the woman I like, so my parents must like you too. I could tell from the hospital last time. They probably can't wait for you to become the Hart family's daughter-in-law."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Valda looked skeptical.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll know if it's true when you meet them," Brian smiled. "Okay, if you're willing to meet them, I'll arrange a time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I don't want to?" She bit her lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then we'll make them wait a little longer," he said. Her wishes were important to him, and he wouldn't force her if she didn't want to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well...let's meet then," Valda took a deep breath and made up her mind. After all, they were her parents, and she had to meet them eventually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, the feeling of having met before in the hospital last time was also okay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His parents are not as lofty as she had originally imagined, but rather quite approachable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll arrange my schedule when the time comes," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda should put on her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in this world, there is always a saying that goes "plans cannot keep up with changes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next morning, Valda heard her phone ringing... but her heavy eyelids were reluctant to open, so she groggily reached out her hand to feel for her phone on the bedside table, wanting to turn off the ringing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as her phone rang, another hand, faster than hers, pressed the button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The ringing has stopped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's gentle voice sounded in her ear, "Today is Sunday, you don't have to go to the studio, you can sleep a little longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"......Oh." She mumbled in agreement, as if to say, "Yes, it's Sunday today, and I can sleep in."</p></div>
