        <h1>Chapter 2525</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Kyla said nothing, Grace could sense that Kyla was missing Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As far as I know, he's currently in L city, recuperating in a mansion in the suburbs. He has passed over most of the company affairs to his subordinates. Only some decisions that affect the company are still made by him," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think he really wants a clean break-up with Kyla?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I guess so. But if Kyla wants to get back together with him, it's not out of the question. Since Martin Weiss was willing to donate his kidney again to Kyla, could he refuse to be with Kyla if he learns that Kyla truly loves him?" Jason analyzed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know if Kyla can take that step," Grace said with a sigh. If the doctor had not said that Kyla should not have too many emotional ups and downs in her current physical condition, she might have been unable to resist telling Kyla what Martin Weiss had done for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Weiss family's mansion in L City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lawyer handed a divorce agreement draft to Martin Weiss. "Mr. Weiss, this is the divorce agreement drafted as per your wishes. Please go over it and see if there&rsquo;s anything to be added or modified."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked through the divorce agreement and handed it back to the lawyer after reading the last page. "It's alright. Send this divorce agreement to Kyla in three months."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She should be well enough by then, so it was natural for them to get a divorce.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll do it," replied the lawyer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the lawyer left, Martin Weiss closed his eyes. His recovery after the second liver donation was significantly worse than the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he had been taking good care of his health, his body was still weak. He felt exhausted even if he had not done much the entire day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This must be the price he had to pay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before the liver donation, the doctor had told him that his health would probably be much worse than before if he donated his liver a second time. He would need to pay special attention to his health. His body might collapse if he was not careful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had expected all these.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a choice he made himself. There was nothing to complain about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, we&rsquo;ll probably have nothing to do with each other for real this time,&rdquo; he murmured, but only the silent air answered him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a comprehensive body check-up, the hospital began to arrange for Simon's transfusion. Louise Mitchell was unwilling, but she knew she could not escape it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she resisted, George Gregory would probably resort to coercion next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory had coldly looked on when Amber Mitchell was suffering back then. How could he show mercy to her? Louise Mitchell knew very well about George Gregory's indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she needed to do now was obediently help Simon with his transfusion, leave the hospital quickly afterward, and then leave Deer City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she knew very well that she was not Simon's biological mother, so Simon's transfusion with her blood would probably not have good effects. If the hospital started looking into the reason, they would easily find out that she was not Simon's biological mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory would probably never let her get away when that happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she had to leave as soon as possible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her father and mother would have to wait!</p></div>
