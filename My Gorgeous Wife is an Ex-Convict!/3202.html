        <h1>Chapter 3200</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Your parents are welcoming the guests," said Brian. "I heard from Camille that you're feeling nervous now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She felt a bit embarrassed and stuck out her tongue. 'Did she tell you?'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled slightly and said, "Don't worry, I've got everything under control."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A gentle voice and a simple sentence miraculously eased the nervousness in her heart little by little...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm worried that if I make a mistake or fall down, it will be very embarrassing," Valda expressed her concerns. "And on a day like today, if I really mess up, I won't just be losing face for myself, but also for the Hart family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, even if you really made a mistake, you don't have to be afraid of losing face or embarrassing the Hart family. The Hart family is your reliable support, not something you have to be cautious about," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt her heart warm as she heard Brian continue, "Even if you did make a mistake, I'll be there with you every step of the way. After all, it's our wedding, and we can do things our way, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda held Brian's face in her hands and leaned in slightly, pressing her forehead against his. "Brian, I'm okay now because... you'll be by my side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I'll be by your side," he murmured in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When it was time for her to make an appearance, Valda stood alone at one end of the red carpet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In a normal procedure, the bride's father would lead her to the groom at this moment. However, Valda's father has passed away, and their family has lost contact with their relatives. Therefore, there are no male relatives present at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, the Hart family planned to have a male relative escort Valda down the red carpet, but Valda refused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go by myself," she decided.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Instead of finding someone who doesn't have much emotional connection to walk this path with her, she would rather walk it alone by herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because this is the most important journey of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the Hart family's side, they agreed to her request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And so, at this moment, Valda held a bouquet of flowers in her hand and walked step by step towards Brian, who was standing on the stage in front of the banquet hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That is the future, and the man she will spend the rest of her life with is the person she loves the most in this world!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From now on, she will rely on and stay with him, they will have children together, and grow old together with white hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her footsteps were unusually firm. Everything around her seemed to gradually fade away, and in her eyes, there was only the presence of one person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she can clearly hear the sound of her own heartbeat and breathing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These are not due to nervousness, but rather anticipation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because she was eagerly hoping to become his wife soon!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Valda arrived in front of Brian. The distance was short, but it took her over two years to get there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he lifted the veil of her wedding dress, she smiled gracefully.</p></div>
