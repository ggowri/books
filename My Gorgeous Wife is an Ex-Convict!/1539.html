        <h1>Chapter 1537</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace and Jason both froze when he uttered out that word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'How long have I not heard him call me &lsquo;Sis&rsquo;...' Grace stared blankly at the person in front of her. There was a time when he occasionally called her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; in private even when they were dating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">To him, she was not only the one he loved but also his family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He said calling her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; made him feel less lonely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace lifted her other hand that he was not holding and gently touched the wet hair on his forehead. He slowly put her hand on his forehead. "Jay, I'm here. Lie down for a while. Everything will be alright once the doctor comes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He stared at her as if his headache could not compare to the shock in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Why... did he just call her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo;? It felt so familiar to him as if he had called it a million times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." he uttered the word with difficulty as if he wanted to ask her something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, stop talking for now. You're having a headache. You'll bite your tongue easily if you speak. When your head stops hurting later, I'll tell you whatever you want to ask. Let go of my hand first. I'll massage you for a little while and maybe you'll feel better," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His dark eyes looked at her again for a moment. Then, he slowly closed them and released his fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her wrist, which was being grasped, was finally free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There was a red mark on her wrist. It would hurt a little when she raised it, but Grace did not care about her wrist. She raised her hands and gently rubbed Jason's forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her gestures were gentle but had the right amount of force. As she rubbed his forehead, her body naturally leaned toward him. Her scent seemed to envelop the tip of his nose.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her scent seemed to soothe his pain, gradually relaxing the frown on his brows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing that Jason's face was less pale than before, Grace finally let out a little sigh of relief and turned to look at the two children standing aside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mick Reed's small body seemed to stiffen. His small face was also tense, while his tiny lips were almost pressed into a straight line. There was a touch of worry and fear in his dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jasper stood beside Mick, one hand firmly holding her brother's hand. Her almond-shaped eyes, similar to Grace's, curiously looked on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, don't worry. The doctor will be here in a moment," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Mick Reed's little face was still tense. Grace's words did not put him at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was only then that he realized his hand was being grabbed by another tiny hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He instinctively wanted to shake the hand off, but the grip was so strong that he failed to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you afraid?" Jasper asked as she blinked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I'm not..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, before Mick Reed could finish, she hugged him. "Don't be afraid. We have to be brave children. Daddy will be okay once the doctor comes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His little body accepted the hug stiffly. Mick Reed felt that this hug was different from the hug he just received from his mother, but... he found it familiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If she's Mommy's child, does that mean she's my sister?'</p></div>
