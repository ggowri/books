        <h1>Chapter 2469</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I only came here today to ask you if you... were pregnant with my baby?" he asked as he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had called him to tell him she was pregnant before the accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had been ecstatic, but she then got into a car accident with Herman Moss. Herman Moss even died trying to protect her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone in Deer City said she had cheated on him. When he got to the hospital and asked the nurse how she was, the nurse said she was not pregnant at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had tricked him! Perhaps she lied to him because she was afraid he would break off the engagement. She wanted to make sure she could marry into the Gregory family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he did not give it any more thought after that. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he somehow remembered the phone call she made back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why did she tell me that she was pregnant, or was there something else she was hiding? Was she in some sort of trouble?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked indifferently at the person in front of her. Her red lips parted slightly as her hoarse voice said with indifference, "No, I lied to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The baby... The baby she was carrying was already gone. When she gave birth to a dead baby in the mental hospital, he was probably being lovey-dovey with Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's expression changed slightly. "You're full of lies. Herman Moss was probably deceived by all your lies. How did you deceive him? Did you tell him you loved him and couldn&rsquo;t bear to separate from him? Or maybe you had already slept with him&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Slap!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A loud and clear slap rang in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The slap was so hard that George Gregory's face was turned to one side.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A touch of anger immediately appeared on his face as he raised his hand to swing back at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he froze when he saw the right hand she had slapped him with. She was missing a finger on her right hand, and it was so glaring!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory, I never once betrayed you when I was in love with you." Amber Mitchell raised her chin and glared at him. "You can insult me however you want. I was blind to have loved you, but you have no right to insult Herman. I'll fight you tooth and nail if you insult him again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You keep saying you never betrayed me, but you want to fight me for Herman Moss. Are you still going to say that you don&rsquo;t love Herman Moss?" He growled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I love him. I love Herman. I only hate myself for loving him so late," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's expression instantly turned ghastly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a tense atmosphere in the air. Just then, there was the sound of fighting outside the ward. The ward door was pushed open, and the men George Gregory brought over were subdued outside. One broke into the ward in a fluster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Gregory... We're sorry we didn't manage to stop them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory looked coldly at Jason and Grace when they entered. After going back that day, he had also checked the two people's identities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, he was surprised when he found out who they were.</p></div>
