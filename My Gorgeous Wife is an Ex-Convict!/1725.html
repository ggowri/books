        <h1>Chapter 1723</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No thanks... I... I can go home by myself. You... You don't have to send me back... I... I don't want to be your third wheel!" muttered Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How can you go home by yourself when you're so drunk?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Don't worry... I... I'll ask my friend to pick me up... Stephenson... Anthony Sherman..." stammered Lina while she took out her phone and began to dial the phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The phone rang several times before the call got through. Grace was about to explain the situation to Anthony Sherman on the other end of the line, but the voice that sounded stunned her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Lina? Lina, is this you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is this Hadwin Stephenson's voice?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was dumbfounded. 'Did Lina... call Hadwin Stephenson?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I'm not looking for Hadwin Stephenson. I'm looking for... Anthony Sherman... Where's Anthony Sherman? Put Anthony Sherman on the phone..." shouted Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Anthony Sherman?" The words seemed to have been squeezed through clenched teeth. "Lina, have you been drinking?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Y-Yeah, I drank a lot and... I have so many men to drink with me... Hadwin Stephenson... You... You don't matter to me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace hurriedly took the phone from her best friend and said to Hadwin Stephenson, who was on the other end of the line, "Hadwin Stephenson, I'm Grace. Lina drank some wine and dialed the wrong number. I'll send her home later." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Where are you?" Hadwin Stephenson's voice was unusually cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before Grace could tell him, Lina said, "We're at... at Star Zouk. Hehe. The handsome men here... are famous. I... spent a fortune today..." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm coming over right now!" With that said, Hadwin Stephenson ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace stared at the phone, feeling speechless all of a sudden. 'Hadwin Stephenson's coming over too? Why do I feel so confused?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Manager Wang, who was standing outside the private room, had been waiting for the door to open again after Jason entered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the door did not open again, and time continued to pass...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Manager Wang almost pressed his ear against the door, hoping to hear what was going on inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What the hell is going on in there? Why isn&rsquo;t anyone coming out even after so long? Did Young master Reed get angry and is... punishing those male escorts?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Manager Wang's scalp tingled at the thought of it. He hated that the sound insulation of the private room was so good that he could not hear anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Just then, Manager Wang's phone rang again and his subordinate's voice sounded. "Manager... Manager Wang, M-Mr. Stephenson is here too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Stephenson? Which Mr. Stephenson?" snapped Manager Wang. He was busy now, but his subordinate was giving him trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Hadwin Stephenson, the president of Stephenson Group. News of his canceled engagement caused an uproar some time ago," his subordinate said. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Manager Wang froze. "Stephenson... Hadwin Stephenson? He... He's here?" For some reason, he had a bad feeling.</p></div>
