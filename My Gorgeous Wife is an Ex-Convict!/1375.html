        <h1>Chapter 1374</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How do you feel? Are you okay?" Jason was the one to panic now. The moment he saw her leaning back, his blood seemed to have frozen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was so shocked that her face turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that she had been too anxious. If she had fallen, the three children in her belly would have been in danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... okay," said Grace after coming back to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason helped Grace to regain her footing and looked coldly at Hadwin Stephenson. "President Stephenson, please watch out. If something had happened to my wife just now, I would make sure the Stephenson family disappeared from J City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson replied with a deadpan face, "Really? Master Reed, it seems like you&rsquo;re talking too highly of yourself. Not only Emerald City, but you're going to interfere with J City too? Master Reed, if you can make the Stephenson family disappear, give it a try."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With the situation between the two men, it seemed like a war could happen at any moment now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pulled Jason and said, "That's enough. Lina matters the most now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she looked at Hadwin Stephenson and said, "Are you going to see Lina today no matter what?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said nothing, but his silence was also an answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know I can't stop you, but my only request is that..." Grace looked at Katherine Jackson who was standing next to Hadwin Stephenson. "Miss Jackson can't go to the hospital!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I insist on going?" asked Katherine Jackson as she raised her chin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sneered, "Since my wife said you can't go, then you can't set foot into the hospital!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Katherine Jackson's expression changed. She had not forgotten that the man in front of her had absolute power in Emerald City. This was not the Jackson family's territory, after all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson turned his head and looked at Katherine Jackson. "Wait for me. I'll come back for you after dropping by the hospital."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Katherine Jackson smiled gently and suddenly hugged Hadwin Stephenson's neck, kissing his lips. Then, she said tenderly, "Okay, I'll wait for you to come back. You must make it clear to your ex-girlfriend. Don't beat around the bush, or I'll be embarrassed when the time comes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it." Hadwin Stephenson's voice was a bit hoarse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked pale. 'Hadwin Stephenson didn't refuse Katherine Jackson's kiss. Does that mean... Hadwin Stephenson is really planning to be with Katherine Jackson?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What... What should Lina do?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked out without a word. Jason protected her closely while Hadwin Stephenson followed behind them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they got to the car outside, Grace turned her head and looked straight at Hadwin Stephenson. "I don't care what you're going to say to Lina or whether you're going to break up with her. But I just want to remind you that at least Lina was someone you once loved. Don't push her to her death. I won't let you go if anything happens to her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace rarely threatened people, but she could do anything for Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no way to stop Hadwin Stephenson from seeing Lina, but she wanted Lina to live well and undergo her treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was too late to hide it from Lina now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had no idea what kind of shock Hadwin Stephenson would give Lina when he met her, but she hoped Hadwin Stephenson would consider their past affections and minimize the shock!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to tell me what to do. I know what to do with Lina and my relationship," Hadwin Stephenson said coldly.</p></div>
