        <h1>Chapter 1653</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The cancelation of the engagement between the two families came as a shock but at the same time, it was also expected. They just did not expect it to happen so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson held a press conference on the same afternoon to explain the situation. "Mr. Hadwin Stephenson and I have already broken up. My boyfriend is the man the media found out about. It was only because of my parents' objection that I consulted Mr. Stephenson, hoping he could continue to pretend to date me and put on a show to hide it from my parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Stephenson only helped me because my boyfriend and I are truly in love. He hoped that I could get my parents to change their minds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"My selfishness caused all this and it has troubled the Stephenson family. Back then, my parents announced our engagement to the public without our knowledge. Mr. Stephenson and I had planned to announce that we were breaking off our engagement after some time. We just didn't expect this to happen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm so sorry for causing Mr. Stephenson and Miss Lina trouble. I now announce that Mr. Stephenson and I are not engaged to each other. We broke up long ago!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Facing the reporters' cameras and microphones, Katherine Jackson said the lines she had prepared. She tried to portray herself as a pitiful woman who was only fighting for true love!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was all she could do for herself now. If she did not portray herself as a woman after true love, everyone would probably be calling her a wh*re.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Miss Jackson, are you going to marry your boyfriend, then? What if your parents object again?" a reporter asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Of... Of course, I'm going to marry him. I'm sure my parents will understand in the future. I'll carry on even if they're against it!" Katherine Jackson looked like she would carry on for true love but was actually cursing the reporter in her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"But that man used to be a male stripper in a nightclub. He... was <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>involved in a special trade. Are you sure you won't think he's not good enough for you?" another reporter asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I love him for who he is. It has nothing to do with his past," Katherine Jackson said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she was cursing in her head, 'Of course, his past has everything to do with it! The Jackson family will be disgraced if I really marry such a man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Besides, a male stripper is not worthy of me! I&rsquo;ll probably become the laughing stock of the upper class!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, that was all she could say now to get out of her predicament.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The reporters mostly focused on the matter between Katherine Jackson and the male stripper. No one cared about Lina now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina was full of shock when she saw the press conference online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had no idea that her name would be cleared in such a way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Katherine Jackson has another boyfriend, and Hadwin Stephenson and Katherine Jackson never planned to get married? They even broke up a long time ago?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What the hell is going on here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina only felt that too many things were happening one after another. Things were changing too quickly. It made her feel as though she was watching a cheesy sitcom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Not long ago, netizens started talking about the Stephenson and Jackson families&rsquo; canceled engagement. It turned out Katherine Jackson loved someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is this what Hadwin Stephenson meant by giving him time for him... to give me an explanation?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mr. and Mrs. Sweeney were also watching the press conference online with Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, what they cared about most now was the matter with the Stephenson and Jackson families. It had to do with when their daughter could return to her normal life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Well... is our Lina okay now? Are people going to stop criticizing her?" asked Mrs. Sweeney.</p></div>
