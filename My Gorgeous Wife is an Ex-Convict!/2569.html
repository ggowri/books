        <h1>Chapter 2567</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amby, don't love Herman Moss, okay? Don't love him... I beg you. Don't love him... Okay&hellip;?" The hoarse voice rang in the ward, sounding as though there was a lump in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lowered his head and rested his forehead on her mutilated right hand as if he were pleading with all his strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was already dark when Amber Mitchell woke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She found that the IV drip had been removed when she raised her hand. 'What time is it?' She sat up instantly and heard a sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're awake."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was surprised to see a figure standing up from the couch in front of her and heading toward her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing here?" Amber Mitchell asked in a daze. Then, she realized that she had asked a silly question. This was a temporary ward in the hospital. No doctors or nurses would kick him out if he wanted to be here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell pulled back the sheets and got out of bed. "I'm going home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her legs gave way as soon as her feet touched the floor. She stumbled forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory leaped forward and grabbed Amber Mitchell. "You gave Simon so much blood and fell unconscious for ten hours. You're very weak right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory, let go of me!" Amber Mitchell said, trying to push him away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he picked her up in his arms and put her back on the hospital bed. "Just stay in bed and don't go anywhere. The doctor will come and run some more tests on you later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory said as he pressed the nurse's bell at the bedside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, the nurse and doctor arrived. After checking Amber Mitchell's temperature and blood pressure, as well as running some basic tests, the doctor said, "Everything is okay. There aren't any problems. But it's better for her to eat porridge or something that&rsquo;s easy to digest. She&rsquo;ll be able to eat normally tomorrow. Also, she&rsquo;d better stay in the hospital for observation tonight and only go through the discharge formalities tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell wanted to get out of bed again after the doctor and nurse left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory stopped her and said, "Do you still want to leave? The doctor said to keep you overnight for observation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell sighed in frustration. "I'm just going to the hospital's cafeteria to see if they have porridge."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory was relieved. Since when did he become so cautious in front of her that even the smallest move could lead him to make such speculations?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've got someone to prepare porridge. I'll ask them to bring it over," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." Amber Mitchell refused without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His expression stiffened. "The porridge is still hot. I also asked them to add nutritious ingredients. The best you can get in the hospital&rsquo;s cafeteria is plain porridge."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I can go downstairs and buy some plain porridge myself," she said. She waved his hand away from her and walked out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She carefully got out of bed this time, and her legs did not give way like before when she almost collapsed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, just as she had put on her shoes and walked out of the ward, he suddenly grabbed her. "Are you not willing to accept anything that comes from me? Not even a bowl of porridge?"</p></div>
