        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler glanced at Tina and said, "Your body has only recently recovered, so it's not suitable for drinking."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The doctor said it's okay to drink some occasionally, "Tina said." I just want to have a glass of red wine with you. Can't I meet this small requirement?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pursed his thin lips a little, and finally chose a bottle of low-alcohol red wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at the wine with satisfaction, then looked at Chandler and said, "By the way, have the insects on your body still been attacking during this time."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Not yet, "he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The onset of Gu insects is inherently uncertain, and the next onset time is not fixed. Sometimes it may occur every few months, and sometimes it may only occur after a month!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina breathed a little sigh of relief, but still said, "If you have a seizure during this period, you must tell me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler pursed his thin lips without saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina knew from the evidence that Chandler had no intention of informing her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just asked you to tell me, are you unwilling? As long as I touch you, as long as I hold you, I can alleviate this pain! "She said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"After that? "He said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? "She froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What happens afterward? Every time after that, do you have to be used to relieve pain? "He said," Then you will gradually become addicted and unable to quit. What should you do then?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you always think about what will happen to me? If you become addicted, I will take responsibility for you. Can't you be selfish? Don't worry about what will happen to me! "Tina sometimes really dislikes Chandler's personality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he said he no longer wanted to be with her, he was still thinking about her everywhere.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he were more selfish and considerate of himself, then perhaps she wouldn't have to be so tired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But on second thought, if he were really like this, then she might not fall in love with him again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler simply said, "Tina, you can't bear the responsibility for my addiction, so don't take things too lightly. Just like before you lost your memory, you also planned to be responsible for me, but in the end, it turned out like this. I'm really tired."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His emotions easily fluctuate with her attitude towards him, and he needs to use too much restraint to maintain his sanity in front of her, otherwise, he may hurt her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina bit her lip and knew she couldn't convince Chandler anymore, because, in his opinion, her love for him was too easy to change, just sympathy. Perhaps after a while, it would disappear.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she knew very well that this love was not sympathy, but a feeling that spread deep within her body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, Tina's takeout was delivered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler, you can help me get some takeout, "Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler walked towards the door, while Tina took the opportunity to open the red wine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Chandler returned to the restaurant with the takeout, he saw that Tina had already poured two glasses of red wine into the glass, one of which was placed in front of her, and the other was placed opposite her seat.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler didn't say anything, but naturally walked to the seat where the red wine was placed, and then placed the takeout dishes one by one on the table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How about having a toast first? "Tina smiled and raised her glass, saying to Chandler.</span></p></div>
