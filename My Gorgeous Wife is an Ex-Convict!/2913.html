        <h1>Chapter 2911</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing her speech, Barbara Schuman took the opportunity to turn to the other people nearby and said, "What do you all think? Shouldn't we ask them to express their opinions on the spot?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of the people around, who didn't understand the situation, were happy to join in and thought that Barbara Schuman was genuinely trying to matchmake the two of them. They all shouted, "Yes, yes! Be together, be together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Soon, more and more people joined in, and gradually, all eyes were on Valda Theller and Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's face was full of gloom. He knew that Barbara Schuman wanted to embarrass Valda Theller. And no matter what he said now, he would only hurt Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What should he do to protect Valda Theller?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's gaze was fixed on Valda Theller, and the hand hanging by his side was tightly clenched into a fist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was anxious at this moment. There were still many reporters on the scene. If Valda Theller didn't handle it well, it could become a black mark in the eyes of others and be constantly magnified online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But if Valda Theller pretended now and said something against her will, it would be another kind of harm to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland knew how much Valda Theller had suffered before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller tightly pursed her lips and was about to speak when suddenly Raymond Bowman's voice rang out, "I do like Valda Theller, but I no longer have the right to do so! It was Barbara Schuman and I who teamed up to hurt Valda Theller! We made her bear false accusations and even made her college life so unpleasant! The real guilty ones are Barbara Schuman and me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman was shocked. She never expected Raymond Bowman to say this. Suddenly, the smug smile on her face disappeared, replaced by fear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, Raymond, if you don't want to confess your love to Valda Theller in this situation, we can find another time!" Barbara Schuman quickly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But Raymond Bowman saw through the fear in her eyes at a glance. "What's wrong? Are you afraid? Afraid that everyone will know about the dirty agreement between you and me back then? Afraid that the truth of that year will be known to everyone here? Barbara Schuman, how much did we owe Valda Theller back then? I'm going to let everyone know now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Barbara Schuman's face turned pale. "You...what nonsense are you talking about!"</p></div>
