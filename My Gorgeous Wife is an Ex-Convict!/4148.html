        <h1>Chapter 4146</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If yesterday was something Kit willingly chose, then she wouldn't do this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But yesterday, Kit was clearly resisting, and even when she rushed in to save him, she clearly saw the despair flash across his face!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Mom, Kit is just starting out on his own now. I want to give him some resources so that he can stand firm. These resources will enable him to have the ability to stand firm without having to do things he doesn't want to do just to obtain resources. After giving him these resources, I promise I won't do something like this again!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina looked at her daughter and suddenly felt that the once well-protected child had grown up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Then why did you come to me? Shouldn't you go directly to your dad for this kind of thing?" Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But Dad listens to you the most, right? If you help me, then Dad will agree," Tina shamelessly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina smiled and patted her daughter's head. Although her daughter's height had long surpassed hers, in her heart, her daughter was still like a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Alright, I'll talk to your dad, but getting him as a spokesperson is unlikely, as it's a significant relationship. However, we can try to arrange other resources."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Just make sure they're not too lousy!" Tina quickly interjected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I know that," Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina finally felt relieved and then suddenly hugged Lina, bending over and burying her face in her mother's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What's wrong?" Lina asked. Since her daughter had grown up, she rarely saw her act so spoiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I just feel very fortunate that you and Dad are my parents!" Tina said. When she was young, she didn't think much of it, but as she grew older, she realized the preciousness of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Her parents provided her with a comfortable environment, surrounding her with love, never forcing her to do anything she didn't like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> They always shielded her from the storms of life, blocking out much of the world's malice and leaving only goodness and kindness for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Especially after what happened with Kit, she understood even more how lucky she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why are you suddenly saying this?" Lina wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I just really want to thank you, thank you for giving birth to me!" Tina muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina's eyes filled with warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In the past, she had always been afraid that one day her daughter would resent her for giving birth to her, for taking away her freedom of choice, because she had agreed to the Hunter family's request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But now, her daughter was thanking her for giving birth to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The burden that had been weighing on her heart seemed to be slowly unraveling...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Having a daughter like you makes me very happy," Lina embraced her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> To have a child like Tina was truly a wonderful thing for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> ------------</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When Kit received the call from his agent, he could hardly believe it. "What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "The director of 'The Edge of Town' called me, they want you to audition for the lead role, and they said as long as there are no major issues, the role is yours!" the agent excitedly said over the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Originally, he was worried about Kit's future opportunities, but now a big opportunity had come, like a pie falling from the sky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit was also stunned. He was familiar with the TV series 'The Edge of Town', it was a big production, and many male actors were eyeing it, including those with talent, experience, and good looks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But now...what on earth was going on?!</p></div>
