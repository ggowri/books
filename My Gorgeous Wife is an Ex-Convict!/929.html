        <h1>Chapter 928</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure. Ask her to give us the phone number and you'll make the call. If this woman dares to say anything she shouldn't say, kill her!" the driver said darkly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face showed fear, but she knew she should not be afraid. If she was afraid, then she could not save herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At least there was still room for improvement. It was better than when she was in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she tried everything in prison, she could not stop the others from hurting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had to suffer no matter what she did.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man fumbled for his phone while Grace gave him Jason's phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was sad when she thought about it. She was desperately trying to keep her distance from Jason, telling herself that he was now Jason and not Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had to rely on Jason at such a crucial moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Shortly after, the phone was connected and Jason's voice sounded. "Sis?" Grace was supposed to be the only one who knew this number, but the number Jason's phone showed was an unknown one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is this your brother?" The man was angry and thought that Grace had fooled him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No. I don't have a brother. My&hellip; My benefactor likes to role-play as siblings with me," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's disgusting! " the man said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason, who was on the other end of the line, realized that something was wrong. He immediately asked, "Who are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We have your baby sister. If you want to save her, prepare ten million and transfer it to our designated account," the man said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, but if you dare hurt her, you won't get a single cent," Jason replied without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just prepare the money!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm serious. If you hurt her, you'll live in pain for the rest of your life." His cold voice managed to pressure the man through the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The hand of the man holding the phone trembled as the device almost fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to hear her voice!" Jason said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man reluctantly held the phone to Grace whose hands were tied. "Hey, your benefactor wants to listen to your voice!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay..." Grace bit her lip and said with some difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you alright? Are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not hurt," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, I won't let anything happen to you," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a short sentence, but it made her feel strangely reassured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright. That's it! Ten million and not a dime less!" The man pressed the end button and sent a text message with the account they had prepared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect your benefactor to be so rich. Paying us ten million without a second thought," the man said with a laugh, "When I get the ten million, I'll&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Enough. Stop talking. Let's get the money first!" the driver scolded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man said no more, and he stopped touching Grace as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace knew that the two men would not let her go even if they received the money. They would probably still harm her after getting it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was no longer worried.</p></div>
