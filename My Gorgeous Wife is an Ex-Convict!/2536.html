        <h1>Chapter 2534</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since they had all the evidence for Louise Mitchell's case, the Moss family would not spare Louise Mitchell. She could avenge Herman's death, so she would have nothing to regret.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell lay straight down in the middle of the road with no fear on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the roadside nearby, George Gregory's face was full of shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He never expected her to agree to a bet like that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her goal was only to get the bracelet back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked fearless as she lay on the ground, but a chill ran up his back as if he were covered with cold sweat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this bracelet that Herman Moss gave her that important to her? Is it so important that she can risk her life for it?' His right hand clutching the bracelet was trembling, and his face was full of fear that even he could not describe!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he saw car lights flashing in the distance, he trembled all over. However, when he saw the car getting closer and closer to Louise Mitchell, he rushed out and stretched out his arms to stop it without thinking much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No! She can't die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I won't let her die!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car screeched to a halt. The driver poked his head out and shouted, "Are you crazy? Are you in a hurry to die by suddenly running out into the middle of the road?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not mind that person&rsquo;s scolding at all. He could only think of her, who was lying on the ground!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you lost your mind?" George Gregory turned and yanked Amber Mitchell off the ground as he glared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said indifferently, "Isn't this what you asked for? I only accepted your bet. Did I win the bet when you rushed out like that? If not, get out of the way. I can do it again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you have a death wish?" He snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't, but I want this bracelet." This was her answer to him, and she said it calmly as if she was merely stating a simple fact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's right hand clenched into a fist, and the diamond bracelet he held in his hand hurt his palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How important is Herman Moss to you? Have you forgotten that you were my fianc&eacute;e? Why would you risk your life for a bracelet he gave you?" He growled in a low voice, his jealousy seemingly bursting through him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Herman sacrificed his life for me. What's wrong with me risking my life for the bracelet he gave me? George Gregory, how dare you say I was your fianc&eacute;e? My fianc&eacute; should be someone who believes me even when others don't. He would come forward to protect me when others bullied me. He would do anything to help me if I was in trouble..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her voice rang, and he grew pale with each word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George Gregory, you were never really my fianc&eacute;. You were just a fantasy of mine at the time." She had fantasized that he could shelter her from everything and be faithful to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she realized in the end that he had never been what she thought he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fantasy?" George Gregory murmured the word. He seemed to look gaunt all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His right hand loosened, and the bracelet he had been holding between his fingers fell to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell threw herself at the bracelet, grasped it firmly, and held it over her heart. She cried and laughed. She had regained something precious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the way she looked hurt his eyes and made him not want to take another look.</p></div>
