        <h1>Chapter 4156 Her Good</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Mm." Tina responded and took the initiative to kiss Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But after a moment, she went from being the one taking the initiative to being passive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler held the back of Tina's head with one hand and kissed her forcefully, with such desire and urgency, as if proving his words from earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler finally released his lips after kissing Tina until she was almost out of breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina's face was flushed as she gasped for air, looking at the handsome face in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Do you want me?" he whispered, his husky voice exuding a special charm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She nodded, her rosy lips forming the word "yes".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In the next moment, he lifted her horizontally and walked into the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Carefully placing her on the bed, he slowly removed his clothes, fully exposing himself to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As long as she desired him, he would willingly give himself to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He was afraid that he wasn't good enough, not beautiful enough, unable to attract more of her attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> He feared that her feelings for him were merely the confusion of adolescence, unable to last, and that someone else would make her love them more in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Does loving someone always involve such anxiety and insecurity?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Today, at the scene of the fire and in the hospital, he also experienced an indescribable emotion when he saw those injured and suffering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In the past, he wouldn't have cared about anything; even if someone died in front of him, he wouldn't have felt a shred of pity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> But now, things were different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Was it because she stayed by his side today, or was it because... for some other reason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In the midst of their intimacy, he seemed to want to give everything to her, causing her to constantly sink deeper...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> ------------</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> In the following days, there was a heated discussion online about the fire incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler gained praise from many people for his handling of the fire aftermath, but of course, there were also many people who questioned whether Chandler was just putting on a show.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Some people even criticized online, saying that the fire happened because the Hunter Group's factory didn't have adequate fire safety measures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, these criticisms disappeared with the release of reports from the fire department and the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The fire department determined that the fire was not accidental, but deliberate!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As a result, the police also began investigating who intentionally caused the fire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After dealing with the factory's matters, Chandler also planned to visit the Hunter family and inform the elders of the incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I want to go with you," Tina said. "After all, I went with you last time, and now I also know the secret that you're guarding for the Hunter family. If I go with you, your grandfather shouldn't kick me out again, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "There's no need to visit the Hunter family. You've been there once, so you should know what kind of place it is," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She said, "I feel like even after we get married, I should go there often. So why not familiarize myself with it now?" The key reason is that she always feels that the Hunter family gives off a cold feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It's as if that mansion hides countless secrets.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although she now knows some of those secrets, she still wants to understand him more, to truly enter the Hunter family and face his family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Technically, you shouldn't enter the extended family before we get married," Chandler pondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But you've already been there once, so a second time wouldn't hurt," she insisted.</p></div>
