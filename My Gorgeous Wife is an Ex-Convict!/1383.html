        <h1>Chapter 1382</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sean..." Jason's mouth spat out these two words. "He betrayed you, but... if he hadn't betrayed you, would you be married to him now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you so sure?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I was young. I didn't know how much the words &lsquo;equal status&rsquo; meant. Now that I think about it, even though I was Sean's girlfriend at that time, his parents would&rsquo;ve never let him marry me and let me join the Stevens family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked back and sighed at herself for being too naive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's more, Sean didn't have that much affection for me either. He may have had some affection for me, but maybe he just found me fresh and interesting. He wouldn&rsquo;t go against his parents or give up everything he had in the Stevens family for me. That's why he was able to distance himself so quickly after the incident."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So would you have married him if he had gone against his parents&rsquo; wishes and given up everything in the Stevens family for you?" Now, Jason was the jealous one. That handsome face of his was full of concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help but laugh. "Do you think everyone is like you? That won't happen. I don&rsquo;t think a man who treats me as a sacrifice can be so affectionate with me.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hands around her tightened a little more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason muttered, "The Stevens family won&rsquo;t be able to enjoy their lives much longer. Since they want someone of equal status, they can share their status with the Atkinson family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She looked up at Jason, asking, "Are you going to do something to the Stevens family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The Stevens family won't appear in Emerald City's high society anymore. Since the Stevens family wants to be in the same boat as the Atkinson family, it's only natural that the Stevens family can forget about having it easy now that the Atkinson family has sunk," Jason said with a faint smile, but there was something resolute and fierce in his tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Others would take those words as a joke if they had been spoken by someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Jason said that, however, she knew that the Atkinson family and the Stevens family were probably done for.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... these were two rich and powerful families. They had a certain foundation to support them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Atkinson family, in particular, had been developing to a new level in recent years. They were ambitious and had even expanded a lot of markets overseas.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Could a family like that sink so easily?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she shuddered and thought of Atkinson Garden&rsquo;s project documents that were on his desk. "Are you going to do something to Atkinson Garden?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He nodded his head as if he was not surprised by her question. "Yeah."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because of me?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They owe you that," he said. 'And I... owe you too.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will it affect Reed Group?" She did not want him to suffer any form of damage just to get even with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No." Jason seemed to see through her concerns and said, "If I destroy half of the Reed family just to destroy the Atkinson and Stevens families, then what can I use to protect you after this? I told you, no one can ever hurt you anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he must be powerful enough to better protect her!</p></div>
