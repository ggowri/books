        <h1>Chapter 2538</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her most important goal now was to keep the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Didn't you say you'll pick up the kids from kindergarten after taking care of the firm's matters today?" he asked. Looking at the time, the two children would be let off kindergarten soon. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I sent Uncle Kwan to pick them up. Uh... Jay, there's something I want to talk to you about," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it urgent?" he asked nonchalantly as he put down his pen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes... Brian might have returned to Emerald City because of my second pregnancy, but I'm not sure," said Grace. She told Jason about her phone call with Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since they had agreed to be honest with each other, she did not want to keep it a secret from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason listened quietly as the expression on his face remained unchanged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I see. Are you afraid I'll overthink it?" Jason asked with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He got up and gently hugged her. "Don't worry, I won't think anything of it. Even if he still has feelings for you, it's just his wishful thinking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was relieved. Her worst fear was that they would have an unnecessary misunderstanding.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Jason's voice paused. "Is it worth it to pay such a price for this baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She muttered, "I think it's worth it. It doesn't matter even if I'll lose my uterus. I'll probably just age a little faster. But I'll give the baby a chance to live. I have more to gain."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason sighed to himself. She was always willing to make sacrifices for her children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had no way to refute her decision. Even though he would rather sacrifice the baby than let her get hurt, he could only give up when facing her determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like this time. Fortunately, the placenta did not grow where her C-section scar was. However, it was in a less desirable location&mdash;placenta previa.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It meant that not only would the pregnancy be utterly difficult, but the uterus would also likely need to be removed when she gave birth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as he heard the diagnosis, he instinctively tried to have her abort the baby. They already had three children. That was enough!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she wanted to keep the baby and continue the pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not because our three kids aren&rsquo;t enough but each life is unique. I don't want to give up on our baby so easily. Besides, it's just my uterus. I don't have to sacrifice my life. I'm much luckier than Kyla in this regard, aren't I? Kyla fought for her baby with her life!" she said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the faint smile made him unable to move his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she had had such respect for every living creature!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was why he was attracted to her and loved her so deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace suddenly felt nauseous. She covered her mouth again and hurried toward the washroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason knew she was suffering from morning sickness again when he saw that.</p></div>
