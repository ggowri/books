        <h1>Chapter 1283</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's my son too. It doesn't only concern you now that he's gone missing! When and where did he disappear?" Martin Weiss said coldly</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After getting the vital information, he called his men to search for the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For some reason, Kyla Corbyn immediately felt relieved when she saw that Martin Weiss had sent people to look for the child. How ridiculous! Martin Weiss should be the last person to put her at ease!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Or maybe... she was too exhausted from struggling to deal with everything on her own. Therefore, even Martin Weiss could put her at ease now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, Kyla Corbyn's phone rang. She answered the phone and suddenly rushed out of the office moments later.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Almost subconsciously, Martin Weiss ran after her until they reached the elevator. "What happened?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We found him. We found Nelson. I'm going to the hospital to pick Nelson up!" Kyla Corbyn said hurriedly. It had been a call from Grace earlier. She told her that Jason had helped them find Nelson. However, Nelson had some injuries, so he was sent to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The hospital?" Martin Weiss frowned and said, "I'll go with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. I can&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla Corbyn, he's my son!" said Martin Weiss. He stepped into the elevator when the elevator doors opened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn bit her lip and followed him into the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss took Kyla Corbyn to the hospital. The moment Kyla Corbyn saw her son, tears could not help pouring out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She sprang forward. "Where are you hurt? Tell me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the little one said nothing and only raised his hand to wipe away Kyla Corbyn's tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Kyla, Nelson's injuries aren't serious. The kids were fighting, but... Nelson broke his hearing aid during the fight. He seemed to be afraid that you'd scold him, so... he wanted to fix the hearing aid by himself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the little one did not know that the hearing aid was not something he could fix.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson seemed to sense what Grace was saying. His small hand was holding the broken hearing aid, showing it to Kyla Corbyn. He then gestured in sign language.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With tears streaming down her face, Kyla Corbyn also gestured in sign language.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked at the mother and son gesturing in sign language and felt a sudden surge of pain and bitterness in his heart. This was his son, but he was a deaf child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While the mother and son gestured in sign language, Kyla Corbyn cried harder and harder. All of a sudden, as if she could not bear it anymore, she suddenly raised her hand and clenched it into a fist before thumping it on her chest hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if taken aback, Nelson stepped forward and grabbed Kyla Corbyn's hand tightly, making a mumbling sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn hugged her son and burst into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah... Ah... Ah!" The sound of her crying struck Martin Weiss's heart, making him feel terribly uncomfortable. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What on earth is going on? What the hell are they talking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said irritably. He did not know sign language, so he could not understand what they were talking about in sign language that made the woman cry so miserably all of a sudden. It was as if... she had been cornered with nowhere to go.</p></div>
