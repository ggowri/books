        <h1>Chapter 2255</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Grace and Jason were probably at today&rsquo;s parent-child event too. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Kyla finally saw Grace and Jason. The two of them were at Mason's side. The things Mason had put out to sell had all been sold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mason stood with Veronica Barlow. He was just like a puppy that followed her around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Veronica Barlow's parents were also here. They were attentive toward Veronica Barlow and Mason as if they took care of the kids well. However, Kyla was aware of their true nature and disliked them. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was surprised to see Martin Weiss after seeing Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After saying hello, Grace pulled Kyla aside and whispered, "What a rare sight to see you attend the parent-child event with Martin Weiss."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't want my son to have regrets. If I were the only one accompanying Nelson to these parent-child events, those rumors will continue flying around,&rdquo; said Kyla. That would only cause trouble for her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you ask Martin Weiss to come along just for Nelson?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla pressed her lip together tightly before smiling faintly. "What are you thinking? What else could it be?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated and whispered, "When I saw you just now, I really thought you looked like a nice family. And the way he protected you after the full moon party, I think... he must really love you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, Grace said, "Kyla, I'm not giving you advice, and I don't care about Martin Weiss. I only care about whether you're living the life you want. Take Jay and me for example. I previously thought about breaking up with him, but then I asked myself if I could ever meet another man who would love me as much as he does and whom I would love just as much. Will I regret it if I lose him? The answer was pretty clear."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I know you want a quiet life. You just want to raise your children and take good care of Aunt until she passes, but you can't just live your life for others. You should also live for yourself." That was all Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, only parties involved in the relationship knew what was going on. She was only an onlooker.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, more people poured into the classroom and squeezed around Grace and Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Each of them was grabbed by an arm, and they were soon separated from the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you alright?" asked Martin Weiss as he looked nervously at Kyla. He saw the crowd rushing toward her earlier and was afraid they might push her. After all, she had a baby in her belly now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "I'm fine. Where's Nelson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There are many people here, so I asked him to wait outside the classroom," said Martin Weiss as he held her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She instantly felt a sense of security. It was as if she had nothing to fear as long as he protected her like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn was waiting outside when the two of them walked out of the classroom. He hurried forward as soon as he saw them. "Mommy, did anyone bump into you and my little sibling?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had no idea whether she was carrying a boy or girl, so Nelson simply referred to them as his little sibling. He would be a good brother regardless of the baby was a boy or a girl. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," Kyla said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said to his son, "I won't let anyone bump into her. I'll protect her and your sibling."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was touched when she heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you tired? Why don't we find a place to sit and rest for a while?" asked Martin Weiss.</p></div>
