        <h1>Chapter 902</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The red mark on her wrist was so hot that it seemed to burn up anytime soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she closed her eyes, she could not get over the image of him kissing the red mark!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Three days later, Kyla got up early in the morning and looked at her son who was still sleeping. Her eyes could not help turning gentle at the sight of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's great that I get to watch him grow up by my side!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was glad that she had not aborted the child but persevered and gave birth to him. It was the most difficult and painful time for her, but&hellip; it was worth it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn saw her daughter's gentle gaze at her grandson when she entered the room and whispered, "Yun, we've packed up everything. We're taking the high-speed train this afternoon. Why don't you get some more sleep?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can't sleep." Kyla shook her head. "The moving company's coming for our stuff soon. I have to get ready."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm worried about restarting the business once we move to G City!" Mrs. Corbyn said worriedly. After all, they had to sell the small restaurant when it finally had a steady customer flow. Mrs. Corbyn was distressed over it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since we did a pretty good job with the small restaurant in Emerald City, then the same applies to G City. Don't worry, Mom. I'll make sure you and Nelson can lead a good life," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn looked at her daughter sadly. "I just want you to be safe!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll be safe. Our family will be safe." Kyla took her mother's hand. 'I want to leave Emerald City for G City precisely for our safety.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People were toasting and mingling with each other in the fancy banquet hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss had attended many parties like this. They would announce his marriage to Paisley Daniels tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Previously, they had only revealed their status as a couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they announced the official wedding date, then the wedding was a done deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A figure slowly walked down the stairs from the second floor, immediately attracting the attention of everyone there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels wore a white gown with expensive diamond jewelry. Her delicate makeup and charming face made her look like the leading star in films.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was indeed the leading star today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people present knew that the Weiss family and the Daniels family would announce the wedding date at the party today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss fell into a trance as he looked at Paisley Daniels who was walking toward him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I going to marry this woman? Am I going to spend a lifetime with this woman? Will I regret it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart felt empty, and he felt as if he had lost something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin!" Paisley Daniels's voice woke him from his trance and he realized that she had stretched her hand toward him, but he had not taken it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Recollecting himself, he took her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I won't regret it! I'm able to stand here because Paisley saved me. Paisley gave me a second chance in life.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he survived, he told himself that he would make this woman happy forever!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He already owed Paisley a lot because of Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla&hellip;' The thought of that face made him out of breath again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels smiled sweetly before leaning close to Martin Weiss and asking in a whisper, "What were you thinking about just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. I was just thinking about work," he said.</p></div>
