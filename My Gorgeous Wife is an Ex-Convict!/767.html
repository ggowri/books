        <h1>Chapter 766</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Therefore, luckily she's not... She's not...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart seemed to be aching again. Brian pursed his thin lips tightly. 'From now on, I'll wipe this woman from my heart once and for all! I&rsquo;ll leave no trace behind!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked up to Jason, only to find him strangely quiet. His beautiful peach blossom eyes were now as dark as the deep sea, giving out a lonely vibe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is... he angry? Is it because he saw me with Brian? Or is it because I had spent too much time on the hill and made him worry?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there were so many people here, so she could not explain herself right now. She could only think of explaining it to him when they were alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry I worried you! I was going to call you, but... I accidentally broke my phone and couldn't contact you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not only did her phone break, but also Brian's phone. Its screen cracked when he was saving her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Both were unable to make calls on their phones, so they were unable to communicate with the outside world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" He lowered his head, raised his hand, and gently pushed some of the tousled hair around her cheek behind her ear. "It's getting late. Let's go back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he spoke, he looked at her long black dress that was quite soiled, making it seem dusty. Then, he suddenly bent over, carried her in his arms, and walked down the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I... I can walk by myself. I don't need to be carried," Grace said quickly. After all, he would be tired carrying her down the hill like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He hung his head low, yet his eyes were not as gentle as usual. They were dark like the thick night. "Brian can carry you on his back but I can't carry you down the hill?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His cold voice escaped his mouth and made her choke. She did not know what to say all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked away from her face and continued to carry her down the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the way he held her was gentle and even though it was a summer evening where a warm breeze was blowing past their bodies, she felt somewhat cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if there was a chill all over him, and she was being eroded by it&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip a little. Jason felt somewhat strange to her at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He must have misunderstood something. It should be all right once I explain it to him later'. She could only comfort herself in this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they had reached the foot of the hill, Grace discovered that there were troops of police and quite a few police cars there. There were even roadblocks down the hill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With such a spectacle, people who did not know probably thought they were catching an important suspect!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason took Grace in his arms and got into a car that was waiting at the side. The car left the foot of the hill immediately, and Jason did not say a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The atmosphere in the car seemed depressing for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence, sitting in the passenger's seat, tried to revive the mood by jokingly saying, "Miss Cummins, you mustn&rsquo;t be out of touch next time. Young Master Reed had put the hills on lockdown just to find you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Put the hills on lockdown?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace almost choked herself. 'That's just too much.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I'm sorry I made you worry," Grace said sheepishly.</p></div>
