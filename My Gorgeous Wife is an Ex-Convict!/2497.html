        <h1>Chapter 2495</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell hurried into the washroom with a worried face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stood outside the washroom while something seemed to flash across his deep phoenix eyes. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was done throwing up and finally rinsed her mouth after she had nothing left to throw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you okay?" Amber Mitchell asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I don't have much of an appetite these days. Maybe I'm just having indigestion." She felt much more comfortable after throwing up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they walked out of the washroom, Amber Mitchell said to Grace again, "Go see the doctor and take care of your stomach after returning to Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay." Grace smiled and looked at Amber Mitchell, then at Brian. "Alright, it's time for me to get on the plane! Let's stop talking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian grabbed her wrist just as she stepped forward. "You can't get on the plane yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" Grace asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His dark phoenix eyes gazed intently at the person before him. A possibility flashed through his mind. Even though the possibility gave him a heavy feeling, he still had to say it, "Did it ever occur to you that you&rsquo;ve been vomiting so often lately not because of stomach problems but because you're pregnant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Pregnant?' Grace was dumbfounded and almost could not believe Brian's conclusion. "No way!" Her body was not fertile. She was lucky to have given birth to the triplets by C-section.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, Jay got a vasectomy in case she got pregnant again. How could she possibly be pregnant under such circumstances?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, it had never occurred to her that she might be pregnant again even after throwing up several times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it really impossible? Have you gotten yourself checked in the hospital?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent. She had never gone to the hospital for an examination. In retrospect, she had been throwing up and did not have much of an appetite these days. She also suddenly had a preference for sweet desserts, which seemed to have happened during her last pregnancy.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I... really pregnant?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at her stomach in shock. 'Is it possible? Could she possibly be pregnant with another child?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get yourself examined and you'll know if you're pregnant." Brian's voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Half an hour later, Grace waited anxiously for the results of her blood test in the hospital's waiting area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she kept telling herself it was a long shot, she could not help wondering if there was really a little life in her belly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell sat next to Grace and kept her company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stood at the door not far away, quietly leaning by the door. From his eyes, he seemed to be thinking of something. He was looking down. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Time ticked by, and when Grace finally got the blood test results, she looked at the two familiar numbers indicating the blood indices. She knew she was pregnant without the doctor telling her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was pregnant! She was carrying a baby!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&rsquo;re pregnant." A mutter rang in Grace's ears. She looked up and found that Brian had somehow walked to her side, and his eyes rested on the test results in her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I&rsquo;m pregnant." Grace smiled faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She and Jay were pregnant again. She did not expect to get pregnant again under such circumstances.</p></div>
