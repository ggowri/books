        <h1>Chapter 1114</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was indeed going to do what Lina said. She was not even going to give her the five million. She only intended to make Hadwin Stephenson get rid of the woman in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect her to be so meticulous and even correctly guessed her intention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Lina's phone rang. She took out her phone and saw an incoming call from Hadwin Stephenson, so she pressed the answer button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are you?" Hadwin Stephenson's gentle voice came from the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm negotiating with the daughter of the boss of Four Seas Property, whom the Stephenson family has chosen to marry you," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Negotiating?" Hadwin Stephenson was stunned and got nervous immediately. "That woman came to see you? Did she do anything to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She's trying to gain something for nothing. She said she's going to pay me to leave you, but she never planned to give me a dime," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elizabeth Jackson's delicately painted face was distorted when she heard that. 'Lina doesn't play by the rules. I'll only make a bigger fool of myself if I stay!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elizabeth Jackson got up angrily. She gave Lina a look that said &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll regret this&rsquo; and left the table without saying a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was still on the phone. She shouted as soon as she saw Elizabeth Jackson leave, "Don't forget to pay for the coffee."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elizabeth Jackson staggered a little, then steadied herself and continued to walk toward the cashier not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" asked Hadwin Stephenson, who was on the other end of the line.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. Miss Jackson has left now. I just reminded her to pay for the bill. After all, she promised me it's her treat today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson could not help laughing a little at that. His Lina never seemed to let him down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the beginning of the call, he was worried that Lina might misunderstand something, but now, it sounded like no big deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shall I come and get you?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm going to Grace's place later. I'll come see you if I have time after meeting Grace." Lina was a good example of putting friendship first and love second.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson could only accept it. Fortunately, only Grace received such treatment among Lina's friends. Otherwise, Hadwin Stephenson would be further distressed if there were a few more!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina came to Grace's rental house, she saw Grace eating dinner and said, "Nice. Here's another dish for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, she put the roast duck she had bought on the small dining table and said, "Is there any rice left? Give me a bowl."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You haven't had dinner?" asked Grace. After all, she had dinner a little late today and did not expect someone to not have had their dinner yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I could&rsquo;ve come earlier, but something held me up," said Lina as she took the rice from her best friend and dug in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had only made a tomato omelet and a bowl of seaweed soup. Adding Lina's roast duck made the dinner a lot more varied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they ate together, Lina asked, "Where did Jason take you? Do you know how worried I was these days?" It was inconvenient to ask about some things on the phone yesterday, so she just asked her face to face today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace made no secret of it, telling Lina about the old mansion and how she had stayed there these days.</p></div>
