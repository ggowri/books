        <h1>Chapter 3593</h1>
        <div><p> </p><p>Jasper was stunned for a moment. Is it really good? Why does he feel that way?</p><p>William just said, &quot;Okay, go back to sleep for a while. We still have three hours before we land. Don&#x27;t fall asleep again when we get to the hospital and see my grandpa.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay, got it,&quot; Jasper replied. After he said that, she did feel a bit sleepy.</p><p>Jasper yawned and adjusted her seat to a comfortable angle. Then she lay down, covered herself with a blanket, and took a nap.</p><p>William quietly watched her sleeping face. Yes, he liked someone like her, a beautiful and kind girl. He already felt very content.</p><p>Compared to his father, who fell in love with his own mother and ended up in such a tragic fate, isn&#x27;t it better for him to be like this now?</p><p>Whenever he thought of his mother, William felt a sense of disgust rising in his heart.</p><p>The various crimes that his mother committed against Auntie Grace were also a burden on him. Even though Auntie Grace had told him many times that the grudges of the previous generation had nothing to do with him, and that the Reed family had taken him in after his mother&#x27;s death.</p><p>However, this did not mean that he was completely unrelated to it.</p><p>He still carried half of the blood of the woman named Lily in his body!</p><p>He really wishes he could completely remove this part of his bloodline if possible!</p><p>&quot;Jasper, I am not pitiful. On the contrary, I am very happy,&quot; whispered William softly.</p><p>Compared to when he was with Lily as a child, not knowing what liking and loving someone meant, now that he understands these emotions and has someone he wants to protect, it makes him feel more alive.</p><p>When the plane arrived at the airport, Jasper woke up from her nap and William lovingly put his coat on her. &quot;It&#x27;s a bit cold in Deer Capital today, wear the coat to avoid catching a cold.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she replied. Sometimes she felt like he was even more careful than her own mother.</p><p>After getting off the plane, the Barlow family&#x27;s car was already waiting outside the airport. Once the two got in the car, it headed straight towards the hospital.</p><p>This time, the old Mr. Barlow was hospitalized due to a heart attack. Although he was saved and admitted to the hospital, he still needed to stay there for a few more days.</p><p>When Jasper saw her grandfather in the hospital, he was in good spirits. As soon as he saw her, he happily took her hand and asked about her college life.</p><p>Jasper talked about some interesting things that happened in college, and also talked about William&#x27;s experiences in college.</p><p>Grandfather listened happily, &quot;Since childhood, our William has always been closest to you. When you two were in different cities, he was always thinking about when he could take a break and go to Emerald City to see you. Now that he&#x27;s in college, you can see each other every day. Poor me, this old man, it&#x27;s not so easy for me to see him anymore.&quot;</p><p>Jasper said, &quot;If you miss him, Grandpa, then let him come back often when he&#x27;s free. And during winter and summer breaks, he&#x27;ll also come back to Deer Capital. By then, I&#x27;ll come too and keep you and Grandma company!&quot;</p><p>The old Mr. Barlow was even happier to hear this. &quot;Jasper, do you have a boyfriend yet?&quot;</p></div>
