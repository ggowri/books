        <h1>Chapter 4151 Found</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Where are the keys?" Kit, however, had no intention of explaining the red mark on his face. He just stretched out his hand and asked the manager for the keys to the warehouse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The manager quickly took out the keys, and Kit swiftly opened the door to the warehouse, then found his nameplate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Underneath his nameplate were piles of gifts from his fans that hadn't been dealt with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, they were in a messy arrangement and it was impossible to tell what they were.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit walked quickly, starting to search through them one by one, looking for the talisman he remembered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What are you looking for?" the manager asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit ignored his words and continued searching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Finally, the talisman from his memory came into his view, but it was older than he remembered, and because of poor preservation, it looked dirty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, at this moment, Kit held the inconspicuous talisman in his palm as if it were a precious treasure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Is this the talisman you were looking for?" the manager asked, "Is it very important?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Yes, very important," Kit muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> This was the amulet Tina gave him. Luckily, he didn't lose it. Luckily... it's still here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After leaving the company, Kit returned to his apartment with the amulet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As soon as he entered, he saw his father already in the apartment, clearly waiting for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Haha, my son, I knew you would listen to me," Edmond's mood was clearly good. As soon as he saw Kit, he approached with a smile and patted his son's shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Edmond continued, "I heard you signed a big contract today, and the resources are from the Stephenson family's daughter. I knew it, that girl is easy to please. As long as you make her happy, the resources will keep pouring in. But you have to be careful, after all, her fianc&eacute; is Chandler."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Edmond was clearly pleased with his son signing this big contract.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit's eyes flickered slightly. He didn't expect his father to already know about the signing today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "This is the only one Tina gave me, and it's the last resource," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What?" Edmond was taken aback.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "She told me she won't give me any other resources in the future." Because this resource was hard for her to obtain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What's going on? Did you do something to make her angry?" Edmond's face changed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit remained silent. Yes, he did make Tina angry today! Angry enough to even lay hands on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had always cared for him, helped him, encouraged him, and showed him warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She was like an enthusiastic fan to him, but to him, she was more than just a fan. It seemed that unconsciously, she had entered his world and became increasingly vivid and important to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Seeing his son silent, Edmond became even angrier. "You've already offended Mr. Perkins. If you offend Miss Stephenson again, what do you think will happen to your future? If no one gives you resources, in the end, you'll just be a washed-up star that no one cares about! Do you really want to live a life of poverty again? Don't think that just because you're my son, you'll get my money!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit sneered. He always knew that his father only saw him as a tool and never truly regarded him as a son.</p></div>
