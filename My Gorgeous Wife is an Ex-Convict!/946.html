        <h1>Chapter 945</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Light came back into Grace's eyes. However, when her eyes got used to the light, she realized Brian and Stella had walked up to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grace, why are you here? You're... here with Mr. Reed?" Stella was also full of doubts. 'Didn't she break up with Jason? Why are they together again? What the hell is going on?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had been worried that Grace would suddenly come and explain everything to Brian, so she did everything she could to discredit Grace in front of Brian and reinforced the impression that she was the girl who saved his life as a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Grace never came looking for Brian. Just as she was breathing a sigh of relief, she met Grace here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's the matter? Can't she be here with me?" Instead of Grace, the speaker was Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course not." Stella forced a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian asked as he looked at Jason, "Why are you with her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He asked without even the faintest disguise!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I told you. You&hellip; can't touch her." Jason gave him an irrelevant answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can't order me around," Brian replied coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, Brian's eyes fell on Grace's face again. "I thought you said you wouldn't love Jason anymore. What's this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace's expression froze. One could say that Brian held no one here in regards by saying this in front of Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jason's expression immediately sank.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a tension in the air.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Hart, this is my business. I don't think I need to report it to you," said Grace as she got up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she got up, Brian could see the full sight of her wearing the gown.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The light purple gown set with white and purple crystals was so graceful and elegant that it attracted much more attention than when she was sitting down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian was stunned. 'This gown&hellip;' He once spotted it on a designer's website, but he was told that the only one was already reserved when he wanted to buy it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, on the principle of confidentiality, they never told him who bought it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">'Now it seems... Jason was probably the one who bought it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, he had collected a wardrobe full of purple dresses. Every year, he would collect them according to the age of the little girl and her estimated height and weight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In many cases, he would even buy the same style in all sizes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, after finding Stella, he did not give her the dresses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He could not tell why. Was he reluctant? However, why was he reluctant?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, looking at Grace who was in front of him, suddenly there was a voice inside him that said... He just wanted the woman in front of him to wear those dresses&mdash;the dresses he had used to sustain his longing for so many years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even he thought it was funny that although Stella was right next to him, he wanted Grace to wear those dresses instead!</p></div>
