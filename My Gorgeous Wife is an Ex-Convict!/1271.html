        <h1>Chapter 1270</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his hand, and his fingertips gently brushed against her lips, wiping away the remaining water droplets from the gargling. "But it doesn't matter if you hate it! We're husband and wife. It's only normal and natural for us to touch each other, isn't it? Even if you're unwilling, are you going to endure it for the sake of the children?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, he turned to leave as though he had no intention of listening to her answer. "Alright, it's getting late. Go to bed. I have some things to take care of in the study."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before he could take another step, a pair of slender arms suddenly wrapped around him from behind. "I don't hate it," said Grace as she pretty much buried her face in Jason's broad back. "It&rsquo;s just morning sickness. I have no way to control it. But at least I didn't hate the kiss earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly stiffened as if he had not expected her to say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, she continued saying, "Perhaps there are certain things that are natural between a married couple, but if we have no affection for each other and if it's only to satisfy desire, then how will we be different from wild animals? At least, I think that kind of... intimacy between a married couple requires some affection... I don't want to do it for the kids, and I don't think you'd want me to either, am I right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&#12288;&#12288;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew he was proud. He was Emerald City's Master Reed. The wealth and power he had in his hands were enough to make him proud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could a man like that have a woman reluctantly do something like that with him for the sake of someone else? That would probably be tantamount to an insult to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He slowly turned around and looked at the woman in front of him. Those almond-shaped eyes were so clear. It was as if all her thoughts and ideas were displayed in front of him without the slightest concealment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Then what kind of feelings are needed for you to do it? Love? Do you think I have to love you and vice versa for you to do it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, are you going to love me again?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, her heart was suddenly beating very fast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Jason left, Grace gently touched the space where her heart was and found that it was still beating wildly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Am I... going to love this man again? For the rest of my life? If we have to be tied together, can I still love him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had thought they would always be two horizons, now they were probably too intertwined to be separate horizons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the study, Jason took out a box from the safe. He gently opened the box and found a brilliant diamond ring in it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Frozen Heart&mdash;the wedding ring he had prepared for her before and designed to her liking. If nothing had happened back then, the ring would have been on her finger by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was lost in thought as he looked at the ring in his hand. He gradually closed his fingers and held the diamond ring tightly, letting the edges and corners of the diamond ring prick his palm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace went to the detention center the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because the video of Stella framing Chase Harper had been accidentally exposed at the birthday party, so Stella&rsquo;s original case against Chase Harper was dismissed. Chase Harper was released right away. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper looked so haggard when Grace saw him. His chin was covered in stubble, but the way he looked at her was still warm.</p></div>
