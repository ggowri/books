        <h1>Chapter 3512</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is he still protecting him like before he was recognized by the Reed family? Or does he see him as a burden?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, where is Veronica?" Jasper asked again, feeling that Mason was strangely different at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't ask me where she is from now on," Mason said and walked away, leaving Jasper alone to ponder on what Mason had just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What did Mason mean by that? Could it be that Mason had a fight with Veronica?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, even if they argue, given Mason's personality, he would at most sulk and would never say such things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This statement... is like completely cutting ties with Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper quickly dialed Veronica's phone number. After a moment, he heard Veronica's exhausted voice on the other end, "Jasper, what's up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, did something happen between you and Mason?" Jasper asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica hesitated for a moment, but eventually said, "No... nothing." She didn't tell Jasper that Mason was one of the people who planned the kidnapping they had experienced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even she couldn't explain why she didn't speak up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, I want to stay at my own place tonight, so I won't go back to the Reed family for now," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't know how to face Mason, but at least her father and stepmother were taking Lionel to the hospital right now, so she could have a moment of peace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, before going to the hospital, her father warned her, "No matter what, you must apologize to Mason tomorrow and admit that you were wrong. If Mason doesn't forgive you, don't blame me for disowning you as my daughter!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I was wrong?" She gave a bitter laugh. "As a kidnapped person, did I do something wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, you were wrong!" Father affirmed with certainty. "As you said yourself, he is Mason from the Reed family, who are high and mighty. Without him, do you think you could live the life you have now? If it weren't for your previous argument and cold war with him, would he have thought of kidnapping? Ultimately, it's all because of your relationship!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Archer continued to blame his daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt extremely exhausted and didn't even want to say much to her father!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A kidnapping had led to so many things, and her father's words made her realize that she was just a tool to tie down Mason for her father and this family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Mason didn't forgive her, then her existence would become unnecessary!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And what about Mason? He just saw her as a toy that he could manipulate at will. Whenever she didn't please him, he could manipulate her emotions and feelings again, making her obedient to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was so tired, she really felt exhausted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night, the Archer couple didn't come back, and only Veronica was left at the Barlow family's house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica almost stayed awake all night, until she fell into a deep sleep around 4 or 5 in the morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when she woke up again, it was because of the sound of the doorbell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Have the father and stepmother come back? But they should be able to unlock the password lock on the gate by themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica sat up groggily, lifted the blanket off her body, and got out of bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, as soon as her feet touched the ground, she stumbled and almost fell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, she felt weak all over, her legs were particularly weak, and her throat had a familiar dry and hot sensation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is she... catching a cold? Veronica raised her hand and touched her forehead. Sure enough, there was a burning sensation on her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seems like you have a fever.</p></div>
