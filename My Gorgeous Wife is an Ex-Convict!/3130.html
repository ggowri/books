        <h1>Chapter 3128</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I told her that my girlfriend is still waiting for me and asked her not to bother me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What happened later? What did you say? When she left, did she seem embarrassed?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I told her to go home and look in the mirror," Brian's eyes narrowed as he spoke. What he didn't say was that the girl had taken one look at Valda and said, "Your girlfriend doesn't even come close to matching you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If it weren't for Valda being present, he would have slapped him directly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to walk some more?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Anyway, it's not time yet. Let's walk a bit more," said Valda as she stood up, holding a cup of milk tea in one hand and linking arms with Brian with the other. They continued walking along the pedestrian street.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes happiness seems quite simple, Valda thought to herself, walking this way makes her feel quite happy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she saw a bridal shop on the street and it immediately caught her attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He followed her gaze and also saw the bridal shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Would you like to take a look?" Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" Valda was taken aback. "Isn't it a bit too early to look at it now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Will it be soon? Didn't you say you wanted to marry me?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It...it's about getting married, but it's not going to happen so soon," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian raised his eyebrows and asked, "Not so fast? Then when do you plan to marry me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hesitated for a moment and muttered, "Well... it will take at least a year. I still need to buy a house, and it will take two to three months for the loan to be approved. Then I need to bring my godmother over. Although the interior decoration of the house I'm interested in is good and doesn't need to be renovated again, I still need to let my godmother adapt to life in Emerald City first..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since we're getting married, you can choose to buy the house or not. If you really want to buy it, we can complete the transaction within a day without waiting for a loan. As for your godmother adapting to life in Emerald City, she can adjust after we get married."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A day to buy a house?" Valda was surprised for a moment, then realized, "You want to pay for the house in full for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not pay for it, since we've decided to get married, what's mine is naturally yours. I'm just buying us a house," he corrected her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he said the word "us," Valda felt a warm feeling in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But... even so, I still need to do leg rehabilitation. Although... it will make it a little easier to walk later on... so... can we get married in a year, please?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if her leg was still lame by then, she still hoped to improve and become a beautiful bride.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she spoke, her voice became quieter and quieter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at her for a while, then suddenly hugged her tightly, "Okay, we'll agree to get married in a year, Valda. A year is my maximum limit, can't we wait any longer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A year was his limit of patience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted her to marry him sooner, to become Mrs. Hart, and to bring her further under his wing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, just one year," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A year later, she thought, she would definitely be very happy, happily married to him...</p></div>
