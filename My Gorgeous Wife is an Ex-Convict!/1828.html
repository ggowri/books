        <h1>Chapter 1826</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctor mistook Anthony Sherman as the father of the baby in Lina's belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before Anthony Sherman could explain, Lina said to the doctor, "He's not the baby's father, so I can make my own decision. Doctor, please arrange an abortion for me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Seeing that Lina was resolute, the doctor said, "Okay, I&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm the baby's father. What if I disagree with the operation?" A voice interrupted the doctor and rang out in the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A tall figure appeared in the ward the next second.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina stared blankly at Hadwin Stephenson, who was walking toward her. He was wearing a simple white shirt and black trousers. His hair was slightly messy, and his shirt collar was not folded properly. It was obvious he had hurried over. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked at the person lying on the hospital bed. When he woke up in the morning, he wanted to call her and tell her that they could finally be together now. He wanted to tell her everything that had happened that year!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he did not expect Anthony Sherman to answer the phone instead. He hurried over when he learned that she was in the hospital because of an accident, but he did not expect to hear her ask for an abortion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why do you not want the baby? If keeping the baby will worsen your injury and threaten your life, then I&rsquo;ll agree to the abortion without a doubt,&rdquo; Hadwin Stephenson said word by word. There was also confusion in his eyes. "It's not like <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>we have to give up the baby right now. As long as we find a better hospital and specialist in tMason Swansonty, we can keep the baby, can't we?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina bit her lip and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll arrange for a transfer right now!" Hadwin Stephenson took out his phone and was about to make a call when Lina suddenly shouted...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"There's no need for a transfer. I have the right to decide whether I'm keeping this baby!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson stiffened as he turned to look at her. "Are you sure you don't want the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes were full of shock. It was almost as if he could not believe she was making this decision.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She met his eyes and felt as if invisible thorns were piercing her heart, making it sting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her throat was terribly dry, but she clenched her teeth and forcefully spat out the word, "Yes!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why?" he asked. She looked like she wanted to keep the baby before this. Otherwise, why would she take the folic acid he bought her? Why did she schedule a pregnancy check-up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's eyelashes quivered slightly, and she felt a bitter taste in her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Why? He's asking me why? Does he know what it was like for me to spend the whole night outside his mansion? Does he know what it feels like to be betrayed for the second time?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Because I don't want anything more to do with you!" The words spat out of her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The air around them seemed to freeze instantly. <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>The pressure around Hadwin Stephenson seemed to drop as the people around him felt terrified. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Well... you guys can work this out and tell the nurse at the station whether you're transferring to another hospital or staying here," the doctor said a little awkwardly before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Anthony Sherman looked at Lina and Hadwin Stephenson. He had no idea whether he should leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mr. Stephenson, I have something to tell Lina alone. Please leave," Hadwin Stephenson said coldly.</p></div>
