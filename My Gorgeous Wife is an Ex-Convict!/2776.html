        <h1>Chapter 2774</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver continued struggling. "Stewart, don't believe them! Who told you that? I can confront them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Confront them?" Stewart Watson slammed the pile of data on the table on Rhea Oliver. "See for yourself how much you need to confront!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver's expression instantly changed when she saw the information. 'I went to great lengths to hide... all these, but... why does Stewart Watson have these?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where did you... get these?" Rhea Oliver asked with a trembling voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;m wondering where they came from too. The pile was on my desk as soon as I came into the study," Stewart Watson snapped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver immediately recalled what Valda Theller's boyfriend had said earlier...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'All relevant details of your dirty deeds will be on the man's desk in three days.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the third day since she met them! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Could that man have done this?' Rhea Oliver's hair stood on end instantly. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver shouted, "I was framed. I&rsquo;ve been framed. Valda Theller's boyfriend must have done this! Didn't we confront him at the jewelry boutique the other day? He deliberately did all this to ruin our relationship!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stewart Watson froze. Then, his expression changed. However, what was on his mind was different from Rhea Oliver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If that man did this, who... on earth is he? How did he find out so much in three days and put the information in my study without anyone knowing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Have I offended someone I can't afford to offend?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that in mind, a cold sweat instantly broke out on Stewart Watson's back as terror flickered in his eyes. The way he looked at Rhea Oliver was full of disgust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Rhea Oliver, do you know that the man isn't someone the Han family can afford to offend if he found all this information? Don't ever come to my place again. Let's break up. From now on, you, Rhea Oliver, have nothing to do with me!" Stewart Watson said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver's face was full of disbelief, but it was pointless no matter how she cried and explained. Stewart Watson even asked the servants to chase her out of his residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rhea Oliver looked blankly at the closed iron gates. Recalling what Stewart Watson had said, she shuddered instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who on earth... is Valda Theller's boyfriend?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If Valda Theller's boyfriend was the one who found all this information, could he... have something to do with the trouble my family's business is facing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'This... No way! Even if the man wears an expensive watch and has a lot of money, there's no way he could have done this!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She denied it repeatedly in her mind, but she trembled more and more. The expression on her face looked increasingly panicked too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland invited some colleagues from the magazine, her family, and friends for her birthday. She booked a private room in a famous restaurant in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland asked Valda Theller, "Are you coming alone, or are you bringing Brian with you that day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to invite him?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's your boyfriend now. I should invite him, of course. But... he's not an ordinary person like the rest of us, after all, so I won't force him," said Camille Strickland.</p></div>
