        <h1>Chapter 2453</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Amber Mitchell is still..." Kyla said hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't have to worry about Amber Mitchell. Although it&rsquo;s only a preliminary diagnosis, the odds are 80% or 90%. I'll conclude the things here. What matters the most for you right now is to deliver this baby and get through this crisis. You can only talk about the future after you get through it. Besides, do you think Amber Mitchell will be happy if you stay here in your condition?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every word Grace said struck Kyla's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip. "Okay, I'll do whatever you say. I'll go back to Emerald City." Her eyes fell on her bulging belly under the bedsheet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was her baby. She wanted the baby to be born safely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt relieved at that. "Then I'll ask the doctor to make the necessary arrangements. You'll return to Emerald City tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she was about to leave the ward, she suddenly seemed to recall something. She said to Kyla, "Do you really think you don&rsquo;t love Martin Weiss enough?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla stared blankly at her and was stunned for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "When you open your eyes, the first thing you think of is Martin Weiss's injury, not the baby in your belly. We all know how much you value this child. You were even willing to sacrifice your own life for the baby, but... it was Martin Weiss you were most worried about, not the baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. There was a look of shock on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace sighed. "Kyla, have you ever thought that your love for Martin Weiss isn't lacking, but you just never realized how deep it is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace left the ward, while Kyla fell silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Never realized how deep it is?' Her heart throbbed in pain at the question, and her hand could not help caressing her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When did I start to have so much affection for Martin Weiss?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is it when he risked his life to save me, or had he always had a spot in my heart even though I&rsquo;ve been saying that I have no feelings for him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But... it's too late now. He has forgotten his feelings for me. So what if I realize I love him now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I don't even know how long I can live. Maybe only a few months or a few years, so how can I love him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Can I love him with my damaged, dying body?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled bitterly, but tears welled up in her eyes and dripped onto the white blanket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had confirmed with the hospital that the ambulance would take Kyla back to Emerald City tomorrow. The first aid equipment on the ambulance made it a better choice for Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After confirming the ambulance and the doctor who would be going along, Grace went to Martin Weiss's ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was half-lying on the hospital bed. The wound on his forehead had been stitched up and was bandaged in gauze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace shuddered at the thought of last night.</p></div>
