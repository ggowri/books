        <h1>Chapter 121</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason's throat felt tight, and he found himself unable to tell her that he was Jason.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He had planned to tell her his identity!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her long hair flowed down her shoulders and her face looked pale under the light. She looked at him nervously with her almond eyes, as if she was worried over something.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Life seemed to have been harsh on her and she had resigned herself to receiving unfair treatment.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, rest well in the hospital and don't worry about anything. After you are discharged, I will tell you who I am," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace looked at him hesitantly before nodding her head.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After she had voiced her concerns, she yawned, feeling tired.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, if you're tired, nap a while. The doctor said that you would feel drowsy for the next few days," Jason said as he helped her to lie down.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After a while, Grace fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason pursed his lips as he looked at her face. He touched her cheek tenderly and moved his hand to her lips.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, tell me, how should I inform you of the truth?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, no one answered him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Grace woke up, she saw Jason sitting by her side. He was still wearing the same suit.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you hungry? Shall I get someone to bring you food?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Grace heard this question, she nodded as she realized that she was famished.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Let me take you to the washroom to wash up so that you can eat your breakfast later." As Jason spoke, he lifted Grace out of the bed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I can do it..." Before Grace could finish her sentence, she found herself being carried up in the air. She immediately wrapped her hands around his neck.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason carried her to the washroom and put her down carefully on a chair beside the washbasin. He then put on a pair of felt slippers for her before helping her stand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Can you steady yourself?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes," she replied softly. Jason was standing behind her, his hands resting on the sides of the washbasin. He was supporting her in such a way that she was almost in his arms.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Although she was standing on solid ground, she felt as if she was floating in the air.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The minute she lifted her head, she could see herself and his face in the mirror that was mounted above the basin.</p></div>
