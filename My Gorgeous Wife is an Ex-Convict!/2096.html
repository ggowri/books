        <h1>Chapter 2094</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let go of me! Where are you taking me?" She struggled even more aggressively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He simply bent over, picked her up, and strode toward the hospital's main entrance with everyone watching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla looked embarrassed. "Put me down!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Martin Weiss turned a deaf ear and carried Kyla to the hospital&rsquo;s entrance. A black car had already stopped there, and the driver got down to open the door for Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">A hospital guard saw Kyla struggling and said, "Sir, what&rsquo;s your relationship with this lady? She doesn't seem to want to get in the car with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said coldly, "She's the mother of my children! If you're worried that something is going to happen, you can take down my license plate and call the police!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Martin Weiss stuffed Kyla into the car and got in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The driver quickly got back in the driver's seat and drove away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The security guard seemed embarrassed, and the other security guard next to him said, "I think it's probably just a lover's spat. Look, when the man said she&rsquo;s the mother of his children, the woman didn't deny it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That's right. That guy's car isn't cheap either. It costs at least three million dollars. If he were a bad guy with bad intentions, he wouldn&rsquo;t need to drive such a fancy car and abduct someone in a place like a hospital, right?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The security guards at the hospital were making speculations while Kyla was in a panic. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss was no longer as angry as he was in the hospital. He had calmed down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the calmer he was, the more anxious she became.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was like the calm before the storm. Perhaps there would be a storm the next moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why abort the baby?" His cold voice suddenly rang in the car. It was full of a biting chill, making Kyla shiver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla bit her lip. "This baby shouldn&rsquo;t exist."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Shouldn't?&rdquo; Martin Weiss suddenly sneered. "The baby shouldn't exist because they shouldn't or because they have my blood?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She froze. She only heard him say, "If you were carrying another man's baby, would you want to have the child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla quivered, and the suffocating feeling in the car upset her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I..." She had just opened her mouth when a large hand instantly covered her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">&ldquo;You don't need to answer that!" He glared at her with flustered and regretful eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What answer did he expect to hear? Perhaps he would only regret it more after hearing her answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, there's no way you can be pregnant with another man's child! It's impossible!" he said. It was as if he was not speaking to her but more to himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She only felt her lips that were being pressed against his palm were burning!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, her phone rang from inside her bag. Kyla hurriedly wanted to take out the phone, but Martin Weiss grabbed it when she had just pressed the answer button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, I just visited Mason and will come over later. You're at the store, aren't you? I bought some seafood. It's fresh. You can have some tonight." Grace's voice came from the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"She's not at the store right now," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There was sudden silence on the other end of the line.</p></div>
