        <h1>Chapter 1500</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Save her and the three children in her belly,&rdquo; Secretary Wang said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;But&hellip; I don&rsquo;t dare to make a guarantee now based on her current situation!&rdquo; the doctor said with a sullen face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the best unlicensed doctor for outpatients in Emerald City. I&rsquo;ve seen your records at your previous hospital. You were in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department for years. A small stomach surgery wouldn&rsquo;t be hard for you,&ldquo; Secretary Wang said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He always diligently did his work, hence he had done his research as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;The surgery isn&rsquo;t hard, but the mother and children may not survive,&rdquo; the doctor said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t save them, then your clinic will probably cease to exist in this huge city by tomorrow.&rdquo; Secretary Wang laughed coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The car was pulled up from the ocean, but there was no one inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The police and the Reed family, as well as many other organizations, had searched through an area of the ocean but they did not find anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had disappeared without a trace, and the so-called &lsquo;golden 72 hours&rsquo; had long passed. It could be said that it was impossible for her to have survived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, what made Terrence even more worried was that Young master Reed was close to a mental breakdown. Who knew when he would completely collapse? If that happened, God knew what would happen?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this time, Terrence looked at Jason who was standing at the edge of the boat. These days, Young master Reed had not left the boat at all. He ate and lived on the boat. He risked it all to find Grace, even if it was just her corpse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even so, Terrence thought that the situation could be worse. At least now&hellip; Grace&rsquo;s corpse could not be found. If not, he was afraid Young master Reed would go insane after seeing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace had saved Young master Reed&rsquo;s life, but she might have ruined his mental state at the same time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Young master Reed, it&rsquo;s late. Please rest. You haven&rsquo;t slept for three days and three nights,&rdquo; Terrence said. He did not know how this man had the determination to stay awake for so long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not tired, I don&rsquo;t need to rest,&rdquo; Jason said with a croaky voice, and his gaze stayed on the pitch-black ocean surface. &ldquo;Tell me, where&rsquo;s Grace?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence did not know how to reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Is Grace cold right now? But I&rsquo;m unable to even warm her hands,&rdquo; Jason said with his body edging closer to the surface of the ocean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, Terrence realized that his boss was about to leap into the ocean!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Young master Reed!&rdquo; He acted out of reflex and held him. &ldquo;Madam has yet to be found, please don&rsquo;t act rashly!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&ldquo;Rashly?&rdquo; Jason suddenly smiled. &ldquo;Tell me, why&hellip; did she make such a decision? All this while, she loved the children in her belly dearly, did she not? At first, she was willing to bet with her life just to save those children! Why... Why did you choose to fall into the ocean?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Under the night sky, Jason&rsquo;s croaky voice sounded very clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence had a heavy heart. He had never seen Young master Reed like this before. He also would never have thought Grace would make such a decision.</p></div>
