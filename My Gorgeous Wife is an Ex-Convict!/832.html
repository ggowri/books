        <h1>Chapter 831</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though the people in this circle were considered rich or powerful by others, everyone was ranked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To Curtis Row's surprise, Brian replied, "Sure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Curtis Row was overjoyed. He felt as if he had just won the lottery. If he could get close to Brian, his status in the circle would be different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Curtis Row led Brian and Stella to the pool table, Grace could not help smiling bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was just what she was worried about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace took a deep breath, stepped forward, and said to Curtis Row, "Mr. Yu, would you please sign this document first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just wait. Don't disturb us!" Curtis Row said impatiently. He was afraid it would interrupt his game with Brian and affect him from making friends with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace lowered her head and bit her lip slightly. She could feel Brian's eyes sweeping over her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However... it was just a sweep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stella, have you ever played pool?" Brian's voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah... No," Stella replied quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll teach you," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella was instantly surprised and responded to him immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian briefly explained the rules to Stella. Then, he taught her how to use the cue stick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His cool voice, accompanied by that light tone, formed a unique lingering charm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella did not expect Brian to teach her how to play pool in person and became even more excited at that moment. However, Grace was standing next to her now. As such, she also wanted to show her sisterly affection in front of Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, Grace is also here today. Why don't&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, she's here for her own reasons. Are you going to say hello to her?" Brian said casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." Stella hesitated. Of course she did not want to say hello to Grace. She also did not want Brian to say hello to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Young Master Gu, can we start?" Curtis Row's voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sure," said Brian. Then, he asked Stella to stand near the edge of the pool table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella also started playing pool, but Grace standing by the side made her uneasy as well as nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Brian's dismissive attitude toward Grace allayed Stella's fears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed that Brian was no longer interested in Grace, and if she continued to remind Brian of his gratitude and childhood memories, she would eventually make Brian fall in love with her. He would no longer treat her as just his savior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stella deliberately went closer to Brian when she played, creating an ambiguous atmosphere. Then, she said, "Brian, you said you&rsquo;d show me the world and let me try everything delicious and interesting when we were little. I never thought it would happen one day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With a flutter of his eyelashes, Brian looked at Stella's face that was covered with heavy makeup and said lightly, "I'm glad you like it."</p></div>
