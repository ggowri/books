        <h1>Chapter 4205</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Previously, a reporter had asked Mr. Hunter directly if he would never marry again for the rest of his life if Miss Stephenson died.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As a result, Mr. Hunter beat up the reporter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The once poised and elegant man had turned into a beast. The secretary even felt that perhaps Mr. Hunter had always been a beast, but in these years, because of Tina's presence, he had maintained his humanity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The reporter was covered in blood, and if someone hadn't pulled Mr. Hunter away, he might have been beaten to death.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the reporter was being lifted into the ambulance, Mr. Hunter simply said, "Tina is still alive. No one can say she's dead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that moment, everyone understood that the words "Tina is dead" were taboo, something </span><span>that could not be said in front of Chandler!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the secretary hurriedly said, "There may be news about Miss Stephenson."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Chandler's face suddenly changed, he took big strides forward and grabbed the secretary by the collar. "There's news about Tina?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes... there's a news report, Kit had a car accident, and there was a pregnant woman in the car with her. We suspect that the pregnant woman is likely Miss Stephenson!" The secretary quickly replied, then after Chandler let go of his hand, he opened his phone and found the news report for Chandler to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at his phone, staring intently at the image of the pregnant woman being carried out of the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though he couldn't see the pregnant woman's face clearly, an instinctive feeling told him that this person was Tina!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His Tina!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had been searching for Tina for so long, and she was in a small town hundreds of kilometers away from Emerald City!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What happened to Tina? What kind of injuries did the accident cause her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Find out immediately which hospital she is in and how serious her injuries are!" Chandler urgently ordered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Chandler's phone suddenly rang.</span></p></div>
