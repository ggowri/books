        <h1>Chapter 2360</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they returned to the table, Kyla was about to pick up the broken teacup pieces on the floor when Martin Weiss said, "Don't move. I'll do it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he crouched down and picked up the broken shards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Watching Martin Weiss crouching before her, Kyla's eyes could not help watering. Even now, the man... was still gentle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The food soon arrived, and Kyla found that the dishes he ordered were her favorites and suitable for pregnant women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">About halfway through the meal, she said, "By the way, I hope you can help me put on a show."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Put on a show?" He looked at her in confusion. "I'm not an actor."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You just have to cooperate with us," she said. With that said, she told him about Grace's plan. "I... don't want to let Jacqueline Bowman off the hook either. It would be best if she can be brought to justice!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It seems that you really know how to cause me trouble. At first, you only said you wanted to get Jacqueline Bowman released on probation. Now, you want me to cooperate with you guys to put on a show. What if I refuse?" Martin Weiss said lazily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her red lip. "Aren&rsquo;t you unwilling to let Jacqueline Bowman get away just like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I can assure you that I'll make her life worse when she gets out!" he said with a determined look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But wouldn't you be breaking the law?" she asked in a panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you afraid that I'll do something illegal?" he asked as he raised his eyebrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She took a deep breath. "Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" His dark eyes stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because you're the father of my two kids..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'And the man I love!' However, she did not utter the last sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a gleam of mockery in his eyes. Her worry only stemmed from him being the father of the children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you afraid it&rsquo;ll affect the kids if I break the law and have a criminal record?" Martin Weiss sneered and said, "Don't worry. You have nothing to worry about!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm not afraid of you affecting the kids. I'm just..." Her voice paused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just what?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm just scared that something will happen to you. Martin Weiss, I don't want to see anything happen to you," Kyla said solemnly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she chose to separate from him, she hoped that he would be safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was silent for a moment before saying, "Okay, then I&rsquo;ll cooperate in putting on this show!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they got out of the restaurant, Martin Weiss brought Kyla to an apartment. It was not too far away from the store, only two blocks away. It was a high-end residential area in tMason Swansonty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had the idea of buying a house a few years ago and had looked at the housing prices. At the time, the agent had said that the housing price in this area was already at 100,000 bucks per square meter. Several years had passed, so the housing prices were probably higher.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you bring me here?" Asked Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you want to check out where you're going to live?" Martin Weiss asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze before seemingly realizing something. She asked, "Is this... ?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, we're going to live here for more than a year. You can check if anything is missing in the unit and list them down so I can have someone buy them," said Martin Weiss.</p></div>
