        <h1>Chapter 283</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whether you&rsquo;re her or not, you will only be with me for the rest of your life. There will be no one else!" he said coldly, staring at the photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His tone of voice was domineering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would never let her go, nor would he give anyone else any chances!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the private room of a swanky club, Evelyn was struggling to please Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn had no guarantees, so she needed to work harder to win over Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, what made her frustrated now was that ever since she entered the private room, he had only been asking about Grace, wanting to know how she was as a child, what her studies were like, and so on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anything that involved Grace, big or small, he would want to know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is this about? I&rsquo;m his girlfriend now!' Evelyn roared wildly in her head but still had to keep a gentle smile on her face and a sisterly expression as she recounted some of the things she remembered about Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she talked about right now was nothing but trivial, little matters in life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian listened with gusto, which made Evelyn even more embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, after finishing a few stories about Grace as a child, Evelyn coquettishly said, "Brian, I know I was in the wrong before, and... my original second female lead role is gone now. Everyone is laughing at me and saying that all your ex-girlfriends were best actresses and top celebrities. I'm the most insignificant one."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at the person in front of him lightly as if he wanted to see how she would go on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn felt like she had no place to hide her thoughts from the man. However, there was something she had to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she did not talk about it, she would gain nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to prove that I can stand by you too, so&hellip; why don't you give me another film? I'll do it well this time and won't create any more trouble," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? What kind of film do you want then?" he asked casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Of course, a film with a big production and has a famous director!' Evelyn cried to herself, but she still pretended to be humble. She said, "As long as I get a film, I don't care what it is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll let you know in a couple of days," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Great! You're so good to me, Brian!" Evelyn said and tried to fall into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian pushed her away. The next moment, his hand was pressed against her face, covering the upper part of it and exposing only her lips and jaw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian..." Evelyn was a little panicked. She did not know what Brian wanted to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at her lips in a trance, his fingertips lightly touching them. They looked just like... her lips, like those of the little girl he remembered which also looked like... Grace's lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Oddly enough, even though he knew that Grace was not the one he was looking for, he could not help but want to know more about the woman&mdash;even the most trivial things about her.</p></div>
