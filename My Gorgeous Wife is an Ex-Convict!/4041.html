        <h1>Chapter 4039</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So Nancy, if it were you, I could also give up everything," Mick murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy looked at the man in front of her in a daze. This man loved her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This was so obvious that anyone could see it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I won't make you give up everything. I love you, and I don't want you to give up anything. I just want to give you more." She said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," he sighed with a smile, "you've given me so much!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She gave him love, family, and children... He felt so happy when he had all of these things!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy respectfully lit incense and bowed three times to the ancestral tablets in the ancestral hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was because of the Reed family's ancestors that Mick existed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"May the ancestors of the Reed family bless Mick with happiness." Nancy silently prayed in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A month later, Mick and Nancy's daughter was finally released from the incubator and brought back to the Reed House.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to being born prematurely, although she had been born for two months, the little one still looked smaller than many newborn babies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She rarely cried loudly and seemed quieter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at her daughter, being able to hold her and feed her milk, and being able to touch her at any time, Nancy felt a wonderful feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if at this moment, she truly felt like a mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From now on, this child would rely on her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She would raise this child, watch her read, fall in love, get married...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because the child had returned, a baby carriage was placed in Mick's room, right next to the big bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Originally, the Reed family was meant to have a nanny take care of the baby so that Nancy could get better rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Nancy hasn't had much time to spend with her daughter since her birth, and now that the baby is back with the Reed family after leaving the hospital, she wants to take care of her personally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Mick didn't want his wife to suffer, he ultimately didn't refuse Nancy's request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for taking care of the baby at night, most of the responsibility fell on Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whenever the baby cried, Mick would wake up first, pick her up, and feed her in the middle of the night, just so Nancy could get better rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even when someone from the company called in the middle of the night with an urgent matter, they heard Mick's voice soothing his daughter, "Be good, wait a minute, Daddy will warm up Sophia's milk and give it to her. Sophia, be patient."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The person on the other end of the phone was stunned, carefully looking at the name and number displayed on their phone over and over again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is this really Mr. Reed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Did they switch people?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mr. Reed can actually speak so gently? And... in a tone of coaxing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Reed... Mr. Reed?" the person on the other end of the phone asked timidly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it's me. What's the matter?" Mick's voice returned to its usual coldness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Okay, it really is Mr. Reed, they didn't dial the wrong number!</p></div>
