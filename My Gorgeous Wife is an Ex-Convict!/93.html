        <h1>Chapter 92</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It seemed that there was no emotion in them at all.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, Terrence had seen his boss look like this before. When Jason had been talking to Grace over the phone, his eyes had been softened with a touch of tenderness. Now, there was not a flicker of emotion to be found.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed, the car is already waiting outside," Terrence said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Let's go then," Jason said flatly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Originally, he had not been in the mood to go to the engagement banquet of the Stevens and Atkinson families, but now things were a little different.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean, the man who had been together with Grace, was no longer in her heart. Even if these two people wanted to get back together, it would be almost impossible.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But...what he wanted was a flawless plan.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He didn't want her to have any chance of having a relationship with Sean, and this was the day to achieve that.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">How could this not be interesting?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace had finished dinner in the apartment. She hadn't had anything to do, so she picked up her phone and browsed the web.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Today on the Internet, whether it was in the news or the trending searches, everyone was talking about the marriage between the Stevens and Atkinson families. Although it was only an engagement party tonight, everyone knew that such an engagement was equivalent to a marriage merger for two of the richest and most powerful families in the region.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was a party really necessary to announce this? Did either the bride-to-be or groom actually need any gifts? No and no.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This was all a show. A demonstration of their wealth and influence that would probably bolster stocks, because people still liked to believe in fairytales, and Lily was every bit a celebrity princess. Most likely, after the engagement banquet was over, the two families would immediately begin preparing for the wedding. Which, no doubt, would be an even bigger and more ostentatious show than this.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace looked at the pictures accompanying the news that had been posted. Those pictures were the engagement photos of Sean and Lily as released by their families.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Lily, who was wearing a white dress, was standing together with Sean, who was also wearing a white suit. In the eyes of outsiders, they were a perfect pair.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The comments below were all envious.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Wow. Rich, handsome, and beautiful. This is a real marriage of powerful families!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Feels like the two of them are made for each other."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">There were a lot of fans of Lily trying their best to promote the engagement party.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">They directly said that this was <span style="font-style: italic;">the engagement of the century</span>! It was <span style="font-style: italic;">too romantic</span>!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was said that Sean had booked the most luxurious hotel in Emerald City tonight&mdash;the entire hotel!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">On top of that, Sean had ordered 990,000 white roses for Lily. She liked white roses, and he said that, in his heart, Lily was pure and flawless like the white roses she enjoyed so much.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was said that Sean had given Lily a villa, which was worth 100 million and made countless women scream enviously all over the Internet.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But it wasn&rsquo;t the money or their relationship that she envied.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It had only been three years since she had broken up with Sean, but it seemed like a lifetime ago. Indeed, in these last three years, she had been reincarnated to a new life. Jason asked her if she wanted to find someone for her to rely on.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She&rsquo;d told him no. That she didn't want to be disappointed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">And that was true.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she didn&rsquo;t want to be alone either.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her heart had been open once, with Sean. She&rsquo;d relied on him, thought she could depend on him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But she&rsquo;d been wrong.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But that didn&rsquo;t mean she had to live in fear. If she was so afraid of being disappointed, she&rsquo;d only end up that way anyway. And alone.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">If she wanted her own happily-ever-after, she&rsquo;d have to be open to love again, and willing to take the risk.</p></div>
