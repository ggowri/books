        <h1>Chapter 1524</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was his own voice!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Did I used to tell this woman all these things?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The next instant, tears were seen streaming out from both of Jason's eyes. He had no control over them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was surprised. She would not have thought that this meet-up would make him burst into tears. All of a sudden, she was at a loss of what to do and quickly helped him wipe off his tears. "Don't cry, Jay, don't cry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The more she tried to wipe off his tears, the more they came streaming down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The people around them, who were initially stunned, were even more shocked at this scene.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Young master Reed&hellip; is crying?! He&rsquo;s crying because of this?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Oh gosh. How many people in Emerald City have ever seen Young master Reed cry?! Yet, now&hellip; we&rsquo;re all witnessing it in front of us? Perhaps no one would believe it if word about what happened today gets out.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even Jason did not expect himself to cry. Furthermore, he was crying so hard. Despite trying to recompose himself and force himself to stop crying, his body was still defying his will, making his tears continue to flow down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why&hellip; Why can a simple statement blurted out by this woman make me cry this hard? When this woman touched me, why did I experience a feeling like I&rsquo;m in love?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It is all because&hellip; she's Grace, my wife whom I thought was no longer on earth? Is it because&hellip; she's the woman I used to be in love with?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But what&rsquo;s the point of it even if I used to be in love with this woman? Since I&rsquo;ve forgotten about all the things that I went through with her, doesn't it mean that my love for her isn&rsquo;t deep?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason quickly grabbed Grace's hand that was trying to wipe his tears away. Then, he pulled Grace forcefully and made his way to the car beside him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Bang! The car door was closed. Grace and Jason were in a black Bentley. At that moment, no one else dared to approach the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Why did Daddy and Mommy enter the car?" When the innocent voice was heard, everyone snapped out of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence looked at the little girl in front of him. This little girl was so cute and her facial features looked like Grace&rsquo;s. At the same time, she also looked rather similar to Young master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence knew that this child was Young master Reed's child! She was one of the triplets Grace had been pregnant with.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It turned out that Little Young Master was not the only one who had survived among the triplets. Another one had survived as well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Indeed, Secretary Wang hadn&rsquo;t lied to us that time!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'However, since Grace is still alive, whose ashes were in the urn that Secretary Wang gave at that time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Also, how did Grace survive? Why is one of the triplets with Grace, while another was handed to the Reed family by Secretary Wang?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, Terrence was confused as there were too many questions to be answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, regardless of what had happened, it was good news that Grace and Young master Reed's children were still alive! Terrence's eyes had tears in them. He squatted and said to Jasper Reed, "Because it's a miracle that you and your mommy have come to visit us. Your daddy has a lot to talk to your mommy about. Let's not interrupt them for the time being."</p></div>
