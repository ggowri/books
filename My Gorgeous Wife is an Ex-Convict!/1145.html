        <h1>Chapter 1144</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you awake?" Brian's voice rang in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she looked up, her face turned slightly red. She gave a vague response and got off quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian got off the bus with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter how fast or slow Grace walked, Brian followed her steadily and saw her off until she reached her rental house&rsquo;s door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'm going home," he said. He did not attempt to enter the rental house. However, just as he was about to turn round, as though he suddenly remembered something, he said, "By the way, even if the police can't find anything about the lounge incident right now, I'm going to keep investigating it. No matter who that person is trying to frame, I'll find them and give you justice!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "So you believe in Stella&rsquo;s words that someone is trying to harm her and I'm the unfortunate substitute who entered the lounge at the wrong time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't believe her. I just want to find out the truth," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you find out the truth and she&rsquo;s the one who did it, will you turn her in to the police and do things fairly?" asked Grace as she looked at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes glimmered. 'If Stella did all this, I will naturally give Grace justice, but... turn her into the police? Do things fairly?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such a case was enough for a sentence. "She... did save me when I was little, though," Brian said with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave a wry smile, suddenly finding it ironic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was she who had chosen to conceal the truth from him. Although she was the one who saved him when she was a child, he was protecting Stella who was trying to harm her because of the affections they had when they were young.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was like the ultimate irony!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she could not say anything! If she told him that she was the one he had been looking for, it would be harder to get him to give up on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she could not give him what he wanted, she could only maintain the current situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said nothing and turned around to open the door to the rental house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Brian's voice came from behind her. "I won't let whoever hurt you off the hook, not even Stella. Not even... myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned her head and looked at Brian in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face, which had always attracted women, was tinged with the color of the sunset. His expression was not of the usual indifference and estrangement but determination. Her face was reflected in those dark phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips were still parting and closing. "Grace, I can't decide whether you want to enter my world, but I can decide whether I want to enter your world! You're the person I want to protect the most in my life, so I'm not going to let anyone hurt you or harm you again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart felt as if it were being pulled by something, and she could not take her eyes off his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt as if a rush of heat had come up from the back of her throat. It mixed with the soreness on the tip of her nose, creating a sensation she had never felt before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The driver dropped Stella off at her place and left. Stella stomped her foot forcefully as she entered the neighborhood and arrived at her apartment building. She stepped into the elevator.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was considered a wealthy neighborhood in Emerald City. Although it was an apartment building, the smallest unit here still cost more than 20 million dollars.</p></div>
