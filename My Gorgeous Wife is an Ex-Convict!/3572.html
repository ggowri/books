        <h1>Chapter 3570</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But... when did you start liking me?" she asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's been a long time, but if I had to say when I really made up my mind to like you, it was during the time I lived with the Reed family," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She widened her eyes in surprise. Oh my god, he was only a few years old back then!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At that time, you were still very young," she said in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, it was very young," he replied with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But could you be sure that your liking for me was a romantic one, between a boy and a girl?" She doubted, even if it was an early love, it couldn't be that early.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At that time, of course, there couldn't be such a clear distinction for the concept of 'liking'. But at that time, I had already decided that I wanted to be with you all the time. Later, as I grew up, I understood what this feeling really meant," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper stared at the person in front of her, feeling her heart suddenly in turmoil.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had been speaking in a gentle voice all along, and there was no coercion in his words. But she felt at a loss and subconsciously didn't want to disappoint or sadden the person in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what kind of feelings does she have for him, exactly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper couldn't stop thinking about this question during afternoon class.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing the public class in the afternoon, Jasper walked out of the lecture hall and saw someone passing by the classroom door. He walked over and said, "I heard that Roger from the chemistry department got into trouble with some thugs outside. It seems like he was surrounded outside!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the name Roger entered his ears, Jasper immediately stopped the person and asked, "What did you say? Roger was surrounded outside?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, it seems like it happened in the alley on the next street. Some classmates saw it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I heard that Roger provoked the girlfriend of that thug!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How could Roger be interested in her? It seems like the girl was the one who approached Roger!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other party and their companions were talking, while Jasper quickly ran towards the school gate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she arrived at the alley that others had mentioned, there were already many people gathered there, including some students from Stanford University.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper squeezed into the crowd and saw only Roger, who was confronting a dozen or so young people, some of whom had tattoos on their bodies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of them, in particular, glared at Roger and said fiercely, "Today, you will kneel down and apologize to me. If you do, I'll forgive you. Otherwise, you can forget about studying in this school again!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Despite the other person's harsh words, Roger showed no fear and calmly replied, "I've already told you, I don't even know your friend. As for her feelings towards me, it's not something I can control."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What do you mean you don't know her? She came all the way to our school for you and even confessed her feelings to you outside the library!" the other person shouted in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger remained unfazed and said, "Do I have to know every person who likes me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You... Do you think you can act tough just because of your looks? You're asking for trouble!" the other person said fiercely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't have time to talk nonsense with you guys here. I'll say it one more time, move aside!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as he said this, the thugs were so angry that they were about to explode. They immediately started attacking Roger, while the surrounding crowd gasped in shock.</p></div>
