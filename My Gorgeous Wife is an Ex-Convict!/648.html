        <h1>Chapter 647</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Along the way, she was clenching the phone in her hands while her eyes reddened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grandma had been discharged from the hospital and went home to recuperate. I thought Grandma was getting better, but... How did this happen?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The call earlier was from a nurse at the hospital. The nurse was asked by her grandmother to call her and tell her that she was now in the hospital. She was almost dying and would even slip into a coma from time to time. Her grandmother&rsquo;s last wish was to see her before she died!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">According to the nurse, her grandmother had been hospitalized for three days, but First Uncle, Second Uncle, and Third Aunt did not call to inform her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the nurse had not called her today, would she not have been able to see her grandmother for the last time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No, no. This won't be the last time I see Grandma,' she kept saying to herself in her heart, but her hands were shaking more and more as she held the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, a large hand covered her trembling hands as a voice rang in her ear, "Don&rsquo;t worry. Whatever it is, I'll face it with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up and stared blankly at Jason who was beside her. "Jason, if Grandma really..." The word &lsquo;died&rsquo; seemed stuck in her throat and she could not say it no matter what. "What am I supposed to do? I don't want to lose Grandma!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Among her relatives, only Grandma was sincerely kind to her! She thought about treating her grandmother well and showing her around... However, these hopes now seemed to have taken on a gray hue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't want to lose&hellip;' Jason pressed his thin lips together. It was like how he did not want to lose his mother, but he lost her anyway. Later, he did not want to lose his father, but he lost him too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she was the only one he did not want to lose!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You still have me, Grace. I'll be there for you no matter what!" he said softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was not God. No matter how much power and money he had, sometimes he was helpless in the face of life too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the hospital ward, the old woman who was already on her deathbed was holding on one final breath while Grace knelt beside the bed. She shouted, "I'm here, Grandma..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The elderly opened her eyes with a shudder and her eyes moved when she saw Grace in a wedding dress. "Why are you&hellip; Dressed like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&hellip; I'm getting married and was trying on wedding dresses today. I was going to come and see you in a few days to tell you the good news!" said Grace, all the while choking and trying not to let the tears pour from her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she was not willing to admit, she was aware that this might be the last time she saw her grandmother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Getting married? Is&hellip; Is it with Jay?" she asked in a mutter. She remembered the boyfriend called Jason that her granddaughter had brought over last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's him," Grace said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason leaned over and said to Grace's grandmother, "It's me, Grandma. I'm going to marry Grace and keep her safe for the rest of her life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He made a promise to the elderly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just because... The elderly was the relative of the person he loved the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grandma weakly raised her wrinkled and dry lips at this and smiled. "Good... Good... Then I'm relieved... I didn't let my daughter, who died so early, down after all... Grace, you must..."</p></div>
