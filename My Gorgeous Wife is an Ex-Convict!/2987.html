        <h1>Chapter 2985</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Next, all online photos of her were hidden, and if you search for information about Brian's girlfriend, you will not find any personal information about her. Even information about "Valda" online, if it is related to Brian, will not be available.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda knows that Brian is trying to protect her by not exposing his girlfriend's situation, as he doesn't want it to affect Valda's daily life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Life remained the same, but Valda knew that her feelings for Brian were growing deeper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, do you want to attend a comic exchange event held in Asia?" Camille arrived at Valda's studio in the morning, holding a stack of brochures. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Exchange meeting?" Valda paused for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, a networking event. There's a spot available through the company, and I'd like to recommend you for it," said Camille. "Your recent comics have been gaining popularity, and your comic-to-drama adaptation has already finished filming. In a few days, it will be broadcasted, and your career will likely take another step forward. Many professional comic artists from Asia will be attending this networking event, and I think it could be helpful for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda became interested when she heard about it, especially after learning from Camille that some of her favorite comic artists might also be there. She immediately expressed her desire to go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The exchange meeting will last for about a week, and there will be dedicated personnel responsible for accommodation and meals. The event will be held in our country, but not in Emerald City, rather in Deer Capital," Camille explained the details of the exchange meeting. "However, some comic artists from other countries may communicate in English. Your English seems average, so maybe you can review it a bit during this time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was startled when she heard this. Her English used to be average, but it had been many years since she graduated and now...she probably couldn't even be considered at an average level.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Immediately, she began to worry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't worry, there will be dedicated translators over there, but you should still review some everyday conversations," Camille reminded. After all, translators aren't with you 24/7, so it's best to know some everyday conversations in case you encounter some manga artists without a translator around.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll review it." Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A month from now, there will be a conference held in Deer Capital. You can take a look at these brochures about the conference later," said Camille.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Camille left, she flipped through the brochure about the conference and let out a sigh. It seems like she'll have to study her English well for the next month!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian came to pick up Valda from work, he saw her holding her phone and looking at it. The screen of her phone displayed some everyday English conversations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you looking at?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So Valda told Brian about the communication meeting and said with a sad face, "Oh, it's true that if you don't work hard when you're young, you'll regret it when you're old! It's been so long since I graduated, and I've forgotten a lot of English. Many words, they know me, but I don't know them!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"In one month's time, you should be able to reach a level where you can have basic daily conversations without much difficulty, considering that you already have some foundation."</p></div>
