        <h1>Chapter 3253</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But giving birth to your child was indeed dangerous." Kyla thought back to the scene when Lina gave birth to her daughter, and she still felt a lingering fear. At that time, they were all afraid that Lina wouldn't make it, but Kyla still vividly remembers Hadwin's despair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, does the child from the Hunter family still come to your house often?" Kyla asked again. Initially, no one expected that the one who would end up saving Lina and her daughter would be a young boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, the little boy Hunter, who saved Lina and her daughter, made a strange request - he wanted Tina Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So now, Tina can be said to have become the child bride of Hunter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, the child has a good relationship with Tina. Kyla has met Hunter a few times before and each time she saw how caring he was towards Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he himself is still a child, he cares so much about another child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, he often comes to my house with an arrogant attitude, always trying to use his intelligence to crush others." Lina has mixed feelings towards her future son-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, Chandler Hunter is quite attractive to Lina, who is a fan of good-looking guys. As he grows older, he becomes even more handsome. However, his high intelligence often leaves Lina feeling frustrated, especially when they play games like cards or chess at home.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler didn't give Lina's future mother-in-law any leeway, which made Lina very angry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially before, Lina became interested in mobile games and started playing them. Unfortunately, she suffered a crushing defeat. As a result, she asked Chandler to play a few rounds for her because she needed to take care of Tina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler ended up winning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She curiously asked, "How are you able to win every time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person responded directly with, "It's probably because of the difference in intelligence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, she was choked and unable to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The only thing that makes Lina feel fortunate is that their daughter can still control Chandler. Whenever Tina makes a request, Chandler will comply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This can only be described as one thing suppressing another thing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Intellectual superiority? What's going on?" Valda was a bit curious. She had only heard a little about the Hunter boy, but had never actually met him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's hard to put into words. You'll understand when you see him next time," said Lina, quickly changing the subject and starting to talk about something else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace and Amber were chatting on the side. Amber looked at the scene in the private room and sighed, "Kyla and Martin have truly reconciled now. It's really heartwarming to see all you couples finally together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And what about you? What are your plans for the future?" Grace asked indirectly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber smiled slightly and said, "Me? Well, I'm actually quite content with my current life. I have work to keep me busy, and if I ever feel the need for a man, I just talk to Herman's picture and reminisce about the past. There's nothing wrong with that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace whispered, "Aren't you afraid of loneliness?"</p></div>
