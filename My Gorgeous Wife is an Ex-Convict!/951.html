        <h1>Chapter 950</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She had just met him when she said that. He was gentle, careful, and never cared about the fact that she had been in prison. She thought he was a good man, but actually&hellip; there was a side to him that was scheming and cold-hearted. He had blood on his hands&hellip; He could never be a good man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me, what will you do if I involve Chase Harper?' he asked, testing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her almond-shaped eyes stared at him with a certain determination. "Don't lay a hand on Chase Harper. Otherwise, I won't forgive you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only threaten him with herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face darkened more and more. "You overreact when it's just about Chase Harper. Are you still going to deny that you care about him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Care about him?' Grace asked herself. She did not have any special feelings for Chase Harper, or maybe there was something simple and ordinary about him that made her wish for his safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more you experienced darkness, the more you would feel that being simple and ordinary was the most valuable quality!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just don't want anyone to suffer because of me, and I don't want to be burdened with guilt," said Grace as she tried to play it down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pondered about it for a moment, then smiled. 'Then it seems that I can't do anything to Chase Harper so that you won't feel guilty about him and think about him so often. However..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice lingered. "You care about Lina, Kyla, and her son. Now, there's another Chase Harper. What about me? Where do I rank in your heart? Will you be so protective of me one day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're the high and mighty Master Reed. You don't need me to protect you," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I insist? You once said you'd protect me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyelashes fluttered slightly as she lowered her eyes slowly. The corner of her lips curled as she said with self-mockery, "As you can see, I can't even protect myself. Otherwise, I wouldn't be your Sis again now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she finished, she felt his body stiffen for a moment. Then, his arms tightened around her. His hug was so tight that she could hardly breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For the next two days, Jason never appeared in front of Grace again. However, there was one thing that caught people's attention online and became a hot topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a video of the Stevens family's daughter, Zoe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the video, Zoe, who was dressed in a skimpy outfit, was on all fours as she ate scraps from a plate with dogs. She even barked like a dog as she ate, making it almost impossible to imagine that she was a Emerald City socialite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as the video was posted, it immediately created an uproar in high society. Ordinary folks left all kinds of comments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Stevens family tried desperately to remove it, but their efforts were to no avail even after they had spent a lot of money. It remained the most searched topic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">You could say that the Stevens family was completely disgraced because of this incident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Journalists had cornered Sean and Lily in their attempts to interview them only to be rejected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the Stevens family's residence, a group of paparazzi was waiting outside. Zoe's face was full of fear and anxiety. She had no idea why she was so unlucky. She had only taken drugs out of curiosity. She faintly remembered being high afterward, but she did not remember what happened exactly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time she woke up the next day, the video was already trending online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been staying at home these two days. She did not even dare to go out the door! Besides that, she had not answered the phone calls from any of her best friends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Pretty much everything in the room that could be broken was broken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as Sean entered his sister's room, he saw the mess that included a broken phone on the floor.</p></div>
