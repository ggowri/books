        <h1>Chapter 3650</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason rubbed his forehead to prevent himself from being infuriated by his daughter, "When did I say that I wanted to scold him?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just asked him to come to the study with me, it doesn't mean I want to scold him," Jason said, then glared at his daughter, "And by the way, you better explain to me later how you 'forced' him!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's scalp went numb. Oh God, if she had known it would turn out like this, she wouldn't have spoken out of turn. Now things were going to be difficult. God knows how she's going to "explain" it to her dad!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...Jason and William arrived in the study. Jason looked at him and asked, "What happened yesterday? How did you end up here in the middle of the night?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I went to the hospital last night, saw Harold and Camelia, and then I somehow ended up here after leaving the hospital..." William explained, recounting the events of last night to Jason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, there was no need for him to hide anything from the other party. Moreover, with the other party's shrewdness, even if he wanted to hide, he couldn't.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After listening, Jason spoke, "Since Jasper likes you, I naturally won't stop anything. However, you are still studying now, and I hope you can exercise restraint and not let things that shouldn't happen happen."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William naturally understood Jason's implication and immediately said, "I won't, I hope more than anyone that Jasper can finish studying what she wants at Stanford University."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's good." Jason said, then picked up a document from the desk and handed it to William, "Take a look at this."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William took the document and glanced at it. It was an investigation report about Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Uncle Reed, you investigated Roger?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since this person is suspicious, of course I have to investigate a bit." Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William flipped through the pages, and in this document, there were also childhood photos of Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, William knew that this was not easy. At least he had investigated Roger himself, and couldn't find much information about Roger's childhood, let alone photos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he flipped to the back and saw a photo of Roger at the age of 10, he realized that there was no resemblance between Roger then and now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In theory, a 10-year-old child should already have some semblance of facial features that resemble those of an adult.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he came across a photo of 12-year-old Roger, he was taken aback. Is this... Lawrence? Because he looked so much like the 10-year-old Lawrence he remembered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just by looking at this photo, he would think that Roger is Lawrence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How is this possible? It doesn't make sense that a person's appearance would change so much in just 2 years between the ages of 10 and 12!" William said, "Could it be that Roger had plastic surgery for some reason?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, he didn't have plastic surgery," Jason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when William reached the end of the information, he was suddenly shocked, "The information says that Roger is not biologically related to the Elliott family couple?! Then who is he?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jason smiled faintly, "Who do you think he is? Haven't you guessed it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William hesitated, trying to guess... Of course, he had his own guesses, but his guesses had already been proven impossible!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Roger can't be Lawrence, DNA testing has already proven it!" William exclaimed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But back then, when Roger was 13 years old, he had a disease and underwent a bone marrow transplant. There is evidence that suggests that a small percentage of patients who undergo bone marrow transplants can have changes in their DNA," Jason explained. "So, Roger must be Lawrence. After the real child of the Elliott family couple died, they adopted Lawrence. Coincidentally, the original Roger, due to his health condition, rarely left the house and never went to school. After they adopted Roger, the Elliott family changed all their servants and family tutors. Lawrence has been living under the name of Roger ever since."</span></p></div>
