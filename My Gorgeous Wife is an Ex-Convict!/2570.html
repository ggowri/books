        <h1>Chapter 2568</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She glanced at him, and her lips slowly parted as she uttered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the word seemed to cast him into hell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her blankly and did not realize when he had let go. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even after she left the ward, he still stared at his hand in a daze like a sculpture.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her warmth still lingered on his hand, but it seemed as though he could never close the distance between them! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell ordered a bowl of plain porridge and a plate of side dishes at the hospital&rsquo;s cafeteria before eating at a small table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After eating, she did not return to the ward but went to the floor Simon's ward was on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to the transfusion, Simon was moved into a sterile ward again. Amber Mitchell could only watch her son through the glass window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She learned from the nurse that Simon was doing well. It would take a few days to see how much effect her blood would have on his condition.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It did not matter to her whether the child would eventually acknowledge her or not. All she wanted was to make sure he was alive and had a bright future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After staying there for some time, Amber Mitchell was about to turn around when she saw that George Gregory was standing behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When Simon is better, I&rsquo;ll tell him that you&rsquo;re his biological mother," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It doesn't matter even if you don't tell him. It's good enough that he knows Louise Mitchell isn't his biological mother." Even if she did not care about the title, she did not want her child to acknowledge the woman who caused her all her misery as his biological mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't let my child regard Louise Mitchell as his biological mother. I&rsquo;ll tell him all the crimes Louise Mitchell committed when he's older and able to distinguish right from wrong. I can also help you get back all the shares Louise Mitchell took from you," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Amber Mitchell's expression remained unfazed even after hearing that. "I&rsquo;ll find a way to get back the shares Louise Mitchell took myself. It's your decision whether you wish to tell Simon about Louise Mitchell. You don't need to explain it to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She walked past him, intending to get back to her ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He immediately called and stopped her. "Amby, must you reject me like this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell paused and turned to look at him. "Stop calling me Amby. Also, I&rsquo;m rejecting you because you rejected me first. Don't you think it's ridiculous for you to say that now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, George Gregory felt as if something was stuck in his throat. He could not say a word!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she was discharged from the hospital the next day, Amber Mitchell went to see Simon again. Simon was already awake, but he had a tube attached to his nose and a drip stuck to his hand as he lay on the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell could only look at the child in the sterile ward through the glass window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Simon also saw her and pouted at her, which made Amber Mitchell smile. Whether or not the little one still hated her, she hoped that her blood could help him. She wished for the child to grow up healthy.</p></div>
