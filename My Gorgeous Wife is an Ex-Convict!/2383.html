        <h1>Chapter 2381</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about the children?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uncle Kwan will look after them. Besides, there are so many servants at home. I'll take our two children with us if you're still worried." As for their other child, he would probably refuse to go to Deer City even if they wanted to bring him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason had a headache thinking of how the boy clung to his &lsquo;sister&rsquo; Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mason's &lsquo;obsession&rsquo; with Veronica Barlow even surprised Jason sometimes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The obsession had gone far beyond the feelings between siblings. He just had no idea if his son's obsession was only a matter of childhood or if it would continue past his childhood days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Deer City is Philip Barlow's territory. Give Philip Barlow a heads-up when you go to Deer City. It'll be easier to handle matters in Deer City." Jason urged her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I can visit William too," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, when Jasper heard that her mother was going to Deer City, she immediately shouted, "I want to go too. I want to go with you, Mommy. I want to see William!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You&rsquo;re not on holiday now. If you go to Deer City, you won't be able to go to kindergarten. Your brother will have to go to kindergarten alone." Grace deliberately made it sound that her eldest son would be pitiful. "Do you want your brother to go to kindergarten alone every day, Jasper?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mick Reed wanted to say that it did not matter if he went to kindergarten alone. He went to kindergarten alone before his mother and sister returned anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his father pulled him aside before he could speak. He heard his father say, "Alright, I'll take you two to Deer City to see Mommy and William during the weekends."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jasper thought it over and concluded it was a good idea. She nodded and agreed. However, she still asked Grace to pass a message to William that she would be there in a few days. She also asked Grace to give him the little frog she had learned to fold with colored paper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a small paper frog, but Jasper solemnly handed it to her mother. Grace looked at the back of the frog. Jasper even wrote the words &lsquo;William&rsquo; on it with a colorful pen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace smiled, put the paper frog away, and said to her daughter, "Alright, I'll pass it to William. You can teach William how to fold this little frog when you and your brother are in Deer City, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay!" Jasper answered loudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace packed her luggage and went to Deer City with Martin Weiss and Kyla at noon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was not in the right shape to take an airplane, so they drove there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss asked the driver to drive an MPV car so that Kyla could rest in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was worried as nothing she had read so far about Amber Mitchell's stay in the mental hospital was good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, stop worrying. We&rsquo;ll be there in three hours. We'll find out what's going on when we get there and see Amber Mitchell," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's identity surprised her. She was the eldest heiress of the Mitchell family of Deer City but was sentenced to 14 years in prison for misappropriating company funds. After her release, she returned to the Mitchell family to fight for power. However, when she was about to succeed, her family sent her to a mental hospital, claiming she was mentally ill. She had stayed there for 14 years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">According to the confidential information they obtained from the hospital, Amber Mitchell's family had visited her over the years. They did not just ignore her after admitting her to the mental hospital.</p></div>
