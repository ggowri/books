        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At this moment, Mia hated Maria to death.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had a good relationship with someone in the personnel department who had secretly told her that it was related to a misuse of power. It was something to do with the person from the Sanitation Service Center.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The only thing she could think of was asking Grace to send the document. However, on this matter, Maria had been the true mastermind!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I didn't force you to do it. You wanted to see Grace get humiliated, that's why you were willing to agree. At most, I just gave you an idea. It's your own doing. It has nothing to do with me," Maria said coldly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The two of them began to attack each other like rabid dogs.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After Mia fell out with her best friend, her family also gave her a hard scolding. However, in the end, they still spent money and made use of connections for her. They tried to find someone to intercede for her, but the money and gifts could not even be sent out.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even those they did manage to send away, all came back in less than two days, returned by their recipients.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Finally, it was an old acquaintance who had had a good relationship with them for many years who secretly said, "Who on earth did your daughter offend? The backing of that person seems to be very strong. I heard from the director of the Urban Management Bureau that in the future, your daughter will find it difficult to find an ordinary job, let alone this kind of secure one."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mia's parents were stunned when they heard that. After returning home, they questioned their daughter about what kind of big shot she had offended.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mia was confused. What big shot could she have offended? In her usual work and life, she did not come into contact with any!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The reunion gathering came to mind. Because what had happened with Greg was pretty hard to forget. And Jason had been furious to have his dinner disturbed by the commotion they&rsquo;d been causing with Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Wait.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Could it be... that the big shot behind Grace was Jason Reed?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This idea flashed through Mia's mind, but it was immediately shot down.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace had crushed Jason's fianc&eacute;e, Jennifer, in a drunk driving accident. The Stevens family, the Reed family, hell, the most prominent families in connection to them had all wanted her head on a platter.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">So who else could be supporting Grace?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was only a sanitation worker&mdash;and a convict. Was it even possible? Or had her parents received bad information?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Nonetheless, after thinking about it for a while, it seemed that the only person she had offended was Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next day, Mia hurried to find Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As soon as she saw Grace, she said with tears in her eyes, "I'm really sorry for that day. It was Maria's idea to ask you to come to the reunion, so I asked you to send me the documents. Since then, I've been regretting it. It's all my fault that you suffered such an insult. I'm sorry."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace looked at her coldly. Like she did not believe a word of what Mia had said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, can you forgive me?" Mia seized the opportunity to ask.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace said calmly, "Why should I forgive you?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">&ldquo;Huh? I... I've already admitted my mistake. Won't you forgive me?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace felt that this was ridiculous. "It's normal for you to ask me to send documents. There was nothing wrong with it. Naturally, I can't talk about forgiveness."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Mia was dumbfounded. What... what was she supposed to say? Did she have to say that she had been wanting to see Grace get humiliated and make a fool of herself, and so she had set her up to deliver the document?</p></div>
