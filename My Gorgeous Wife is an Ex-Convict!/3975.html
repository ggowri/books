        <h1>Chapter 3973</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want unreasonable requests!" The other party clearly had no intention of letting Nancy go, and grabbed her as she was about to leave. "Since you're here, drink this bottle of alcohol before you go. Otherwise, don't blame me for not giving you face!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy frowned slightly. The alcohol the other party brought out was strong, and if she drank it, she would likely get drunk.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sorry, I..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she was about to speak, the other party had already picked up the bottle and rudely shoved it into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the bottle's mouth was against her throat!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The alcohol flowed down her throat and directly into her mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was extremely uncomfortable and desperately tried to push the other party away, but the other party's two friends grabbed her arms, leaving her no choice but to drink the entire bottle of alcohol like a fish on a chopping board!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the bottle was finally pulled out of her mouth, the hands that had been holding Nancy's arms finally let go.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy bent down in distress, constantly choking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her throat was burning, accompanied by a nauseating feeling in her stomach.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is to teach you not to interfere for others when it's unnecessary!" As the other person's words fell, they picked up a bottle of alcohol and poured it directly over her head.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her head and face were soaked with alcohol!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then, the person's words made Nancy suddenly stiffen, a chilling feeling spreading throughout her body!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The person said, "Mick, I heard that this woman is the one who made you angry. I'm just helping you vent! If you don't think it's enough, why don't you come and do it yourself?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy was shocked. Could the person this man was referring to as Mick be the one she thought it was?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really? And who did you hear that she's the one who made me angry from?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The familiar cold voice echoed in the air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy suddenly looked up in the direction of the voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the darkness, she saw a figure sitting there. Due to the lighting, she couldn't see his face clearly, but that figure...and that voice...were enough for her to understand who it was!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, Mick was there from the beginning.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he saw everything that happened to her from start to finish.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy felt her heart sink in an instant, sinking into an abyss that seemed bottomless.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what is there to be so sad and upset about?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does she still hope that he can help her?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>To him, she was someone who had used him. The fact that he didn't directly harm her was already an act of kindness.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I...I heard it from someone else...I can't remember who exactly, but isn't this the woman?" The person who had bullied Nancy said awkwardly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Recently, in the wealthy circles of Emerald City, everyone knew that this month, Mick Reed, the eldest son of the Reed family, was in a bad mood.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If someone else made a mistake in front of him, they would definitely not get off lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had finally found out from someone else why Mr. Reed was in a bad mood. It was </span><span>because of a woman!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was said that this woman had done something that betrayed Mick, so he had set up this plan to directly confront her and please Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, the situation seemed...not what he had expected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could he have been mistaken?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, the person became uneasy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick slowly stood up from his seat and walked straight to Nancy, looking down at her with a superior gaze.</span></p></div>
