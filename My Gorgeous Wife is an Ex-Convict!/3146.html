        <h1>Chapter 3144</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why you deliberately prevented me from getting up, that's something you have to answer," Valda said. "If you truly came to apologize, then there's no need to livestream it, or even point the camera at me without my permission. Or perhaps, are you trying to use public opinion to make me agree to something?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy was taken aback, Valda was even more composed than she had imagined!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some of the viewers in the live broadcast room are starting to realize that Tracy is trying to use them as a weapon!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Theller, I... I apologize in the live broadcast. I just want more people to witness my sincerity. I truly apologize, and you don't have to forgive me, Miss Theller. I know that when you make a mistake, you have to bear the consequences. I just hope that Miss Theller can be the bigger person..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tracy said timidly, as if she was a poor victim.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda looked at the acting in front of her and felt disgusted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Miss Barlow, if you want to act, I won't accompany you!" Valda said, then turned and left, ignoring Tracy crying behind her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long after, Valda received a message from Camille, "Valda, you're trending. You need to talk to Brian. Many people online are saying that Tracy was banned because of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was confused for a moment, but then realized that it was probably because of Tracy's recent live broadcast that caused the trend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, I understand," Valda said, and just then, Brian called.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda ended the call with her friend and answered Brian's call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Valda, don't pay attention to what's being said online. I'll take care of it," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hasn't even looked at it yet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Camille's phone call just now, Valda has a general idea of what people are saying online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are they discussing Tracy's ban online because of me?" Valda asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian hesitated for a moment before answering with a "yes". "I'll handle it, trust me!" he quickly added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I believe you," said Valda. "But Brian, you also have to believe me. I'm not as fragile as you think. Even if I see the comments from online users or face attacks, I can handle it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of being with him, she was destined to not be able to become an invisible person. In that case, she might as well face it openly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian hesitated for a moment on the other end of the phone and then said, "Valda, you are really stronger than I imagined."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda smiled and said, "In the future, I will become even stronger!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the phone call ended, Valda took out her phone and looked at the comments from online users.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Camille previously mentioned her trending topic, which has now disappeared. However, related content can still be found through a search.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There are criticisms directed towards her in some of the content.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some people have even openly claimed online that she is Brian's fianc&eacute;e and that Brian banned Tracy because of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some people online have shifted from attacking her to attacking Brian and the Hart family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's face became increasingly unpleasant as she read those comments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She doesn't mind when those netizens attack her, but she does mind when they attack Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She doesn't want Brian to suffer any humiliation because of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She... also wants to protect Brian!</p></div>
