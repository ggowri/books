        <h1>Chapter 321</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Coming out of the company after another interview, Grace could not help but give a wry smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought she was mentally prepared and was even willing to work as a rider with no basic salary, which some companies had, but even then, she was turned down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that it was almost noon, Grace found a small restaurant by the side of the road and ordered a bowl of noodles that cost ten dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was already the cheapest bowl of noodles in the shop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was also an old television set in the shop. The news was playing on the TV and it was replaying yesterday's news. Grace listened casually at first, only to look up sharply at the mentioning of a familiar company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was... the company where she first interviewed for the rider job. It was also their boss who called Jason and told him about her interview.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason had previously said he wanted to get rid of the company.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, the news said that the company was facing a capital chain rupture. The money that was earmarked for investment was suddenly canceled, and many civilians who partook in the company's private financing were protesting in front of the company, demanding the company to pay them back. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scene was a real mess, judging by the images taken by the news reporters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace watched and was secretly horrified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did Jason do this? He could make a promising company turn into such a mess in just a few days?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If so, then Jason was indeed capable. If not, then... Were there such things as coincidences?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought as she ate her noodles. Suddenly, she felt something clutching her shin. She looked down and saw a little boy around 3 years old, dressed in some dirty old clothes. Even so, he was a beautiful child with delicate features and fair, soft skin. She could not help but want to pinch his chubby cheeks that only children had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Right now, the little one's dark, round eyes were looking straight at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked strangely at the little boy before looking around. It was now lunchtime and there were several tables occupied. For a moment, she did not know which table the child was from.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She picked him up, only to find his eyes staring straight at the noodles in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why, do you want some noodles?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the little boy seemed unresponsive as he ignored her, his eyes still fixed on the bowl of noodles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did he like noodles? Grace did not mind ordering a bowl of noodles for the boy, but first, she needed to find his family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as she was about to ask around, a modestly dressed woman in her 30s rushed up to her, apologetically saying, "I'm sorry my son bothered you. It's my fault for not keeping an eye on him. I'm sorry. I'm sorry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman apologized profusely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace recognized the woman as the cashier of this restaurant. She saw her when she ordered her noodles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She heard the man in front of her calling the woman &lsquo;boss&rsquo; earlier. She did not expect her to be the little boy's mother.</p></div>
