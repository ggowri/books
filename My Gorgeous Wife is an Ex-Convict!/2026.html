        <h1>Chapter 2024</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Mr. Stephenson's worried about the danger you might encounter, so he asked us to secretly protect you, Miss Sweeney," they said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Their strange behavior also attracted the attention of the people around them. A voice suddenly rang out. "Hey, isn't this the woman who had an affair with the president of Stephenson Group and then went viral because she got pregnant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, when Anthony Sherman's malicious post went viral, the photos and videos that the press had taken of Lina before this were also posted online. Although Hadwin Stephenson deleted them afterward, many people had seen them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was no surprise that a few people could recognize Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, many people were looking in their direction and began to talk after hearing the statement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Hadwin Stephenson received his subordinate's call, his eyebrows furrowed slightly. Then, he said, "Okay, got it. I'll come over right now." As soon as he finished speaking, Hadwin Stephenson turned to the people he was having a video conference with and said, &ldquo;Continue with the meeting. I'll have my secretary take notes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Hadwin Stephenson left in a hurry, leaving puzzled looks on the faces of the people holding the video conference on the big screen on the wall. They had no idea what had happened that made their president leave in such a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the secretary knew what was going on. After all, no one besides Lina could do this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Hadwin Stephenson's car arrived at the cafe's entrance near the mall, he also saw Jason, who was hurrying over as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson immediately had a bad feeling, while Jason only raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What a coincidence. We meet again," Jason said as he walked forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, we meet again," said Hadwin Stephenson, feeling slightly embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I heard that they're here to meet celebrities today. Which idol or celebrity has your woman been fangirling over these days?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was immediately speechless. 'Which? She's been fangirling several, even dozens of them. I have no idea which celebrity is Lina trying to meet today. The bodyguard didn't make it clear on the phone either.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason probably figured it out, so he said, "Let's go in and check on them first. But speaking of which, even if Lina loves you, you have to try hard to keep her eyes on you so that she'll fangirl over celebrities less."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'And bring Grace along with her less!' This unspoken sentence was Jason's main concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson rubbed his temples."What about you? How did you get Grace to keep her eyes on you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason smiled. "Just make yourself more attractive to her than the other men she wants to see. Women can charm men. Can't men do the same?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson glanced at Jason. 'Did this guy...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You have good looks. Do you think you're no match for those idols and celebrities?" Jason patted Hadwin Stephenson's shoulder and entered the cafe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson glared at Jason's back and followed him inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two women were sitting in the cafe, chatting with the film crew's major production team over coffee. They looked like they were having the time of their lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The film crew had rented the cafe because they were filming there today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Due to the commotion outside earlier, the film crew recognized Lina. Besides, she was pregnant, so they hurriedly invited her in.</p></div>
