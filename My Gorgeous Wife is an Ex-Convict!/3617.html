        <h1>Chapter 3615</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, someone knocked on the car door. Jasper startled and quickly let go of William's hand. He turned his head and saw a traffic police officer standing beside the car, looking at them through the window.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper quickly rolled down the window and saw the officer impatiently say, "This is just a temporary parking spot, not a place for long-term parking. You young people should pay a little attention. Don't start cuddling and talking about love as soon as you park the car. At least park it in the right place!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper's face turned red and he stammered, "Got it..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William then started the car again and drove away from the roadside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper lowered his head, thinking about what the officer had said. Did she... and William really look like a couple?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, the dream she had last night popped into her mind again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She then lifted her head and looked at the person driving next to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she wasn't with him, would he fall in love with someone else in the future? And at that time, the person reflected in his eyes would no longer be her, but another woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He would do many things for another woman, and she would no longer be as important to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, she would feel very uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what is this uncomfortable feeling? She knows she likes him, but is it the kind of liking between a man and a woman?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have any place you want to go?" William's voice suddenly rang out in the car.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" She was startled and snapped back to reality, "We can go anywhere."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So he drove the car to a wet and muddy park in Emerald City.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Today is the weekend, and there are quite a few people in the park, mostly families with parents and children coming out to play.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The scenery here is nice, how about taking a stroll?" William suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure," Jasper agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them got out of the car and walked along the path.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They had been here before, but it had changed quite a bit in the past few years. There were many new shops along the way, all built with a scenic design, resembling antique architecture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The buildings blended in with the scenery and looked quite beautiful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, earlier in the car, why were you looking at me with that expression?" William's voice suddenly sounded, "Are you worried that I'll be bothered by those two people's matters?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper quickly shook her head, "No."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William was somewhat surprised by her answer, "Then what is it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um..." she hesitated for a moment, "Um, I was just...thinking about something." She didn't know how to explain it to him, she was looking at him like that because of the dream she had.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, two girls walked towards them, and one of the girls gathered her courage and asked, "Hello, are you guys dating?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was taken aback and was thinking about how to answer, but William beat him to it and said, "No, we're not."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Jasper heard this answer, he felt a sudden pang of disappointment for some reason.</span></p></div>
