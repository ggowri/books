        <h1>Chapter 2228</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace dressed me up, but I'm old. I'm nothing like what you just said." Kyla chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After chatting with Lina for a while, Kyla turned around and walked to a table with Mrs. Corbyn. There was a buffet at today&rsquo;s party, which was made Kyla feel more at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said to Mrs. Corbyn, "Mom, sit here while I get us something to eat."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla walked toward the serving area, and a voice suddenly rang out. "Kyla, what... What are you doing here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked up and saw Jacqueline Bowman with Neal Reid standing beside her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a look of uncontrollable shock on Jacqueline Bowman's face. After all, Neal Reid put in tremendous effort to get an invitation to the party, while she worked hard to convince Neal Reid not to bring his wife but her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid wanted to make connections with more members of the upper class, while she wanted to make friends with the wives of rich businessmen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the more contacts one had, the more valuable one was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect to see Kyla here. Especially since Kyla was wearing a gown she had seen in a magazine. It was a couture gown from a luxury brand. The dress alone was worth millions of dollars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Ordinary people could not rent it at all. One could only buy it, but no ordinary person would buy a dress that cost millions of dollars unless they were wealthy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It must be fake!' Jacqueline Bowman thought to herself, but it looked so real!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Surprise flashed across Neal Reid's eyes as he looked at Kyla. The woman was much better looking than the last time he saw her, making him understand why Martin Weiss was interested in the woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her beauty, even he was enticed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did Martin Weiss bring you here?" It was the only possibility Jacqueline Bowman could think of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "No. I'll just get something to eat and leave you alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said as she bowed a little and left, leaving Jacqueline Bowman with a puzzled look on her face. Some thoughts started flashing in her mind. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were not many people in the buffet area. Kyla took some food that was easy to chew and suitable for the elderly. Just as she turned to leave, a hand snatched the plate from her hand. "I'll take that for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze a little, and Martin Weiss's figure came into view.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was instantly caught off guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was wearing a crisp black suit. His slicked-back hair and defined features gave people a sense of rigor and indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his eyes looked at her warily as if he was afraid she would refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The words &lsquo;no thanks&rsquo; seemed to be stuck in her throat, making it difficult for her to speak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, what she said was... "My mom's waiting for me at the lounge." With that said, she took the lead at the front while Martin Weiss hurriedly kept up with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two looked like a match made in heaven as they walked side by side. They also caught many people's attention.</p></div>
