        <h1>Chapter 2853</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes glimmered as he muttered, "Yeah, I missed out on Grace. At least I didn't miss out on you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Maybe God pitied him and let him meet her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, I don't know how long it&rsquo;ll take me to fall in love with you. But... even if I only like you and you still want to stay with me, we'll get married. I will make you my wife." His elegant voice said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get married? You... want to marry me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I'll make you my wife if you're willing." As long as she did not mind that he could not love her, he would give her everything he could afford!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this a proposal?' Valda Theller was still thinking about the question in a daze after Brian left the studio.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or is he trying to make things up to me because he doesn't have the confidence to fall for me? But will anyone sacrifice the rest of their life to make things up to others?&rsquo; Valda Theller was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, her two assistants were not in the studio today. Otherwise, today's incident would not have escaped her two gossipy assistants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller lay on her work desk, but she had no intention of working. Her mind was full of what Brian had said to her today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was glad he was willing to tell her about his past with Grace today. Did it mean that he was gradually opening his heart to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Valda, did something good happen?" Her assistant's voice rang suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller froze as she looked up at her assistant and asked, "Why did you ask?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because you keep smiling like you've won a five million dollar lottery. Something good must have happened to you to put you in a good mood, Valda," her assistant said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller raised her hand to touch her cheek. It turned out that even other people could see that she was in a good mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, something good happened." She smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, her phone suddenly rang. Valda Theller picked up the phone to see that her uncle, Ferris , was calling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hesitated for a moment before picking up her phone. She heard her uncle's voice. "Valda, come over if you're free. I have something I want to tell you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it about Aunt and my cousin borrowing money the last time?" Valda Theller asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, no, don't overthink it. Come back first," said Ferris .</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I see. I&rsquo;ll go back tonight," said Valda Theller. Recalling her childhood, her uncle was nice to her when her parents were still alive. She liked him very much too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her parents died afterward. Her uncle became her guardian and took charge of the inheritance her parents left for her. Everything gradually changed after that.</p></div>
