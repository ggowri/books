        <h1>Chapter 2921</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A feeling called jealousy pervaded his entire being. At this moment, he was so envious of Raymond Bowman, the man he had previously looked down upon, who was now being accepted by her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Why was it that she could accept Raymond Bowman, but not him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She should still love him, shouldn't she? Or perhaps... she no longer loved him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This thought flashed through his mind, making him restless and uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, he wouldn't let her fall in love with Raymond Bowman. The only person she could love was him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian Hart's kiss became even more intense, and his hands held her tightly in his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller only felt the still lingering smell of blood in her mouth becoming stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the previous accident was due to being drunk, then what was this one?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She didn't want to have that kind of relationship with him, but now she was powerless to resist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, she felt like a fish on a chopping board, at the mercy of others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She loved him so much, but now the man she loved the most didn't believe her words and was doing things that hurt her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tears couldn't help but flow from her eyes, and Valda Theller stopped struggling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if she had resigned herself to her fate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tears flowed down her cheeks and into their kissing lips, making him taste the salty flavor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he looked up, he saw that her face was now covered in tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those round eyes were also filled with tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The last thing he wanted to see was her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't cry," he murmured, kissing away her tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian Hart, if you really won't let me go, then fine. But I don't want to get pregnant. If you have any pity or guilt towards me, then I hope you can take precautions." Valda Theller closed her eyes and remained motionless, as if her entire soul had been emptied, leaving only a shell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you... hate me that much?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She didn't answer, still motionless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, he stood up and straightened out her disheveled clothes. "Valda Theller, I was impulsive today. I'm sorry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her previous words were like a bucket of cold water, extinguishing his impulse and anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It also made him realize what he was doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had sworn not to let her be hurt again, but now he was the one hurting her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller slowly opened her eyes and looked at the man in front of her, with a sad expression on his handsome face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart also ached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You've said sorry to me so many times, but do you know what I want? Respect and trust," Valda Theller murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gave a bitter smile and stumbled back a few steps. "I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, it seemed that he didn't know what else to say to her besides "sorry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... rest well. I won't do anything to hurt you..." he said, turning around and leaving her bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he walked into the living room, he bent down and picked up the photos on the ground.</p></div>
