        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," Tina said. "Harley, I hope you can truly understand your own feelings and not end up like me, realizing afterward what you truly want and missing out on something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley smiled, but there was a hint of sadness in her eyes. "Yeah, I will."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She understood that Tina said these words because she had noticed Lornell's indifference towards her before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they were clearly engaged, no one outside knew about their relationship.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And even though later on, he introduced her to his medical school classmates and informed them of her status as his fianc&eacute;e.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, he only used her as a shield, making it easier for those girls who liked him to give up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was he who proposed the engagement in the first place, so he never showed any signs of wanting to back out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she also knew very well that he had never truly liked or loved her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Their engagement was like a mere agreement, and only she foolishly put her feelings into it, without getting any response in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What does she really want, then?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After going in circles for a while, Tina still hasn't regained her memory, but she knows clearly that what she wants is Chandler's affection.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So what about her? Does she want Lornell's affection?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Tina left, Harley walked into the private room and saw Lornell making a phone call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It must be to someone from the Quentin family. Harley sat quietly beside him, not saying a word.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a while, Lornell finished the call. Harley looked at him and said, "You promised Tina to take her to the Quentin family. Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why do you want to thank me?" he asked, "I agreed to Tina's proposal because the terms of the deal were very favorable, and the Quentin family had no reason to refuse."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley pursed her lips, "Does the Quentin family always have to calculate everything in terms of trades?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong with that?" he asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about you? Do you also trade in everything?" she asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He squinted his eyes slightly, "What exactly are you trying to say?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you have even a little bit of liking for me? Do you have even a tiny bit of feelings for me?" Harley couldn't help but ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps it was Tina's bravery in wanting to enter the Quentin family that influenced her, so now she finally asked the question she had been wanting to ask!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell stared at Harley, "Why, do you think I am a cold-hearted person?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't feel that way." She bit her lip slightly and said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If I didn't like you and have any feelings for you, I wouldn't have saved you back then," Lornell said. "People from the Quentin family may be used to life and death situations, and they may be a little colder than ordinary people, but it's not that extreme."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's attention was focused on the first half of his sentence: "You like me? Have feelings for me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Over time, people develop some feelings for their pets, let alone you, who can be quite amusing at times. However, you've grown up now and aren't as entertaining as you were </span><span>when you were young," Lornell said casually, then stood up. "Alright, today's business is almost done. Should I take you home or back to school?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley lowered his head and felt as if his mood had suddenly fallen from the clouds to the dust.</span></p></div>
