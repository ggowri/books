        <h1>Chapter 405</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's going on here?" Brian did not ask anyone else, just Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he would only believe what she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"One of the lunchboxes I delivered today had a bug in it. They asked me not to charge them for all the food today and asked the restaurant to pay them 5,000 dollars in compensation. I thought it would be better to leave this to the police, but they found out I was recording the conversation on my phone, so a conflict broke out," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A recording?" Brian raised his eyebrows slightly. "Do you mind if I listen to it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they heard Brian offering to listen to the recording, their faces paled. Once Brian finished listening to the recording, his face darkened. He now understood that the dispute occurred because some of the crew members were trying to blackmail her, which led to the subsequent conflict.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director, assistant director, and production assistant who were with Brian also understood what was going on. One by one, their faces took on a ghastly expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If this got out, the film crew would be embarrassed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They could chastise these people later. The most important thing now was... "It's our fault for not restraining these temporary staff, Miss. I would like to apologize on behalf of the crew. If you want any compensation, just tell us."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. It's good enough that everyone understands. However, I don't want them to bother our restaurant anymore," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew it would be bad for Restaurant if this became a big deal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be best if they could just put the matter to rest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, of course!" repeated the director. Then, he looked at Brian to see if the crown prince was satisfied with how they handled it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned around to leave. After all, it had been a while since she came out and there were orders to deliver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had only taken two steps before someone pulled her arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stopped in her tracks and looked back at Brian with a flash of doubt in her eyes. "Anything else, Mr. Hart?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian seemed a little confused. He looked at his hands in amazement as if it was a knee-jerk move. It was as if he could not bear to see her leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to spend more time with her, even if it was as simple as standing together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he did not see her, he could still contain this feeling in the bottom of his heart, but once he saw her, he could not help wanting to look at her for a while longer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even at the sight of her almost being hit earlier, he had felt anger and fear. He feared that she might be hurt, and he experienced a desire to punish the person who tried to strike her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he could not bear to see her suffer the slightest injury.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. It's just... your shoelace is a little loose," he said, going down on one knee. With both hands, he pulled the laces of her left shoe and knotted them again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone around, not just the film crew but even the fans outside the fence, gasped in shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although these fans idolized different celebrities, who would not recognize the entertainment industry&rsquo;s crown prince?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was even more famous than celebrities! Many people were secretly wondering what woman could tie the crown prince down.</p></div>
