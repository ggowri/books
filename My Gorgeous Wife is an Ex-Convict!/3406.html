        <h1>Chapter 3404</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although he hoped his son would eventually be with Jasper, and even used this as a way to convince his son to embrace his heritage, as the children grew older, he became afraid that his son would become too fixated on this idea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all these years, the father has seen all the hard work his son has put in for Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand," said William, but understanding doesn't necessarily mean he will let go!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he doesn't want to and he doesn't feel like it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Philip didn't say anything else, he just took William and went to greet some other Emerald City celebrities at the party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After exchanging pleasantries, William made his way to the hallway. Just then, a girl dressed in a high-end custom-made dress approached him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hello, I'm William. I'm pleased to meet you. My name is Yvonne Jones, and I'm the granddaughter of Chairman Jones from the Jones Group. Would you like to be friends?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person had a smile on their face and a confident expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When he came down with Jasper earlier, she noticed him. She heard that he is the son of the Barlow family from Deer Capital and childhood friends with Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the Jiang family may not be as prominent as the Reed family, they are still well-off. Plus, she is also attractive, and has always been the center of attention among the boys.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So right now, she is very confident that William won't refuse to be friends with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, she will naturally find a way to snatch William from Jasper's hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even if the Reed family is more powerful than the Jiang family, it doesn't matter as long as she can win over William. In that case, Jasper will still be inferior to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Yvonne is completely absorbed in her thoughts, feeling confident that she can outdo Jasper in her own way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, she heard William's voice saying, "I'm not interested in being friends with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yvonne's expression froze, she didn't expect the other person to refuse so bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's just...making a friend, nothing else. Why bother..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she was about to finish speaking, William interrupted once again, saying, "Not interested!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yvonne's face turned red and then pale. It was the first time she had been rejected like this, and she felt embarrassed and ashamed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially those who came to attend this birthday banquet today, including her friends. Before coming to see William, she boasted to her friends that William would definitely agree and even be ecstatic about it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The current situation is equivalent to slapping her face in front of everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmph! What's so great about you? I want to be friends with you because I think highly of you. Otherwise, do you think you, the son of a criminal, are worthy of being my friend?" Yvonne said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She heard about William from the adults. They said that William's mother used to be a celebrity named Lily, and she might have been a young lady from the Atkinson family. Unfortunately, she was also a criminal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's face changed and his dark eyes stared straight at Yvonne, making her feel scared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, she lifted her chin and said, "Why are you staring at me? I didn't say anything wrong. It seems like your mommy also framed Jasper's mommy before! Your mommy is a criminal of the Reed family! I wonder if Jasper knows about this. If she knew how your mommy framed her mommy, would she still want to be friends with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William's expression became even colder as he walked towards Yvonne step by step. Using a frigid tone, he said, "Say what you just said again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The look just now already flashed a hint of murderous intent.</p></div>
