        <h1>Chapter 2665</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You won't," Valda Theller said affirmatively.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His phoenix eyes narrowed slightly. "What makes you think I won't? Or have you forgotten that I'm a man?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because if you said you won't, then you won't. I believe you," she said. She knew that his heart was with another woman. He dated her for the person he loved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes flickered. Moments later, he slowly said, "Don't believe in me too much. Maybe I'm not what you think I am."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," she replied, but her clear eyes were still full of trust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The trust pressed on his chest like a heavy weight, making him feel a little uncomfortable...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman found Camille Strickland and asked, "Where's Valda Theller?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was full of disdain. "Why should I tell you? Haven't you caused enough trouble for Valda? If you hadn't harmed Valda like that, would the reporters crowd her so much that she can&rsquo;t even go home?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, she hasn't been at home these two days?" Raymond Bowman asked. He had been to Valda Theller's house, but no one answered after he rang the doorbell for a long time. No one showed up after he waited in front of her house for quite some time as well, so he came to Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Based on Camille Strickland's relationship with Valda Theller, she must know where Valda Theller was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland said impatiently, "Raymond Bowman, what on earth do you want? It's none of your business where Valda is!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why is it none of my business? I..." Raymond Bowman's voice stopped short, and he did not continue speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You what?" Camille Strickland looked at him in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing." Raymond Bowman let out a breath. No matter how much he told Camille Strickland that he was worried about Valda and wanted to protect her, Camille Strickland probably would not believe him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, he had made too many mistakes in the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me where Valda is and how she&rsquo;s doing," Raymond Bowman said again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you going to pretend to be nice this time? Raymond Bowman, I won't tell you where Valda is staying, but she's doing well now. Her boyfriend is taking care of her. There&rsquo;s no need for your fake kindness," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Raymond Bowman's eyebrows furrowed when she mentioned the word &lsquo;boyfriend&rsquo;. "How much do you know about her boyfriend? She didn't have a boyfriend a little over a month ago. Don't you think it's strange that she has one out of the blue?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland froze. She did not expect Raymond Bowman to know that Valda did not have a boyfriend not long ago, but... "What's so strange about that? She and her boyfriend fell in love at first sight, and their relationship is blossoming fast! Did you think Valda would be in love with you forever just because she used to be in love with you? If she&rsquo;s fallen for someone else, then does it mean there&rsquo;s something wrong with the person she fell for? Raymond Bowman, you think too highly of yourself!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland's statement made Raymond Bowman's expression ghastly. "I just don't want Valda to get fooled."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland said with a fake smile, "You're the biggest fraud Valda has ever met!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, she walked away without looking back. Raymond Bowman stood there with his hands clenched.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If possible, he would like to go back to the time when he had not fooled Valda, but it... was impossible...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the next few days, Valda Theller saw that there was no more news about her online. Even if her name was mentioned in the film's marketing campaign, it did not cause much of a ripple.</p></div>
