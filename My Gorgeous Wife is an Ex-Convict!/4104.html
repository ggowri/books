        <h1>Chapter 4102</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What can he do to me? After all, I'm Chandler's fianc&eacute;e. After we get married, I'll be able to come and go from the Hunter estate. It's just a matter of time." Tina deliberately downplayed the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina breathed a sigh of relief. "That's true. After you graduate, you'll marry Chandler. Hunter shouldn't do anything to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hadwin's face finally softened. "Have you really decided to marry Chandler after you graduate?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I have. I'm going to marry Chandler," Tina replied firmly, without any hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's good," Hadwin said, and didn't say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, Lina was busy asking about Hunter's mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina explained the process, but left out the part about Chandler's bath and the church.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After her parents finished questioning her, Tina collapsed on her bed, exhausted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even now, she still found Chandler's talk about the bugs and the woman in the church painting unbelievable, but she believed him because she knew he wouldn't lie to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what did her grandfather mean when he said Chandler had to have a child to live?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If sleeping with her could calm the bugs and end his suffering, what did having a child have to do with the bugs?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Chandler didn't want to say more, so she was left with her questions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina saw Weldon again when he gave her and Kit a copy of the photos they had taken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, have you seen the real Chandler yet?" Weldon suddenly asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina tensed up and looked at Weldon warily. After all, she didn't know how much Weldon knew about Chandler and the bugs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems you know something," Weldon smiled. "Do you know about the church? Have you seen the painting inside the church?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You--" Tina stared at Weldon with wide eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Weldon continued, "So, Chandler has something in his body. Do you know what it is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You also know about the curse?" Tina blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as the words left her mouth, she wanted to curse herself for being so foolish! Come on, the other person never even mentioned the word "curse"!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It seems you know too," Weldon smirked. "The curse is something that the Hunter family has been unable to get rid of for generations. If someone in the Hunter family has the curse in their body, it's difficult for them to live long. Of course, it's not entirely hopeless. As long as you find the right person, you can be cured. Chandler chose to marry a little girl like you because you are the one who can cure the curse in his body."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina didn't expect Weldon to know so much!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, Chandler is likely just using you. In Hunter, there are many people like you who are used to cure the curse. As a member of the Stephenson family, are you willing to be used like this?" Weldon asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina stared at Weldon. "Why do I feel like you're trying to sow discord?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" This blunt statement made Weldon feel embarrassed.</p></div>
