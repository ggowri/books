        <h1>Chapter 4020</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes and his tone were telling her that he loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, a man like him wouldn't bother lying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he really loved her, then maybe he would also love the child in her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, he should choose to accept this child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They might be able to be together, and this child of hers... would be their first child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By then, the child would have a father, a mother, and they would be a happy family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy didn't say anything else and lowered her head to finish her porridge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Should she admit that the child was his?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long ago, she denied it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um... about the child in my belly, I want to..." she started to speak, but he interrupted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can we not have the child?" Mick asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What?" Nancy was stunned, clearly not expecting him to say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can we not have this child? If you like children, we can wait until you're better and have one later," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why not? Is it because of what I said before, that the child isn't yours?" Nancy asked anxiously. "That wasn't true, the child is yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I never doubted that the child is mine," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then why? You said you love me, so why not have the child?" Nancy was confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This child is too much of a burden on your body. If you continue the pregnancy, you may not even make it to the day of delivery, your body may collapse before then!" Mick said. "So we don't want this child. The doctor will perform an abortion for you, and after the abortion, with treatment, your body will slowly recover."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't want to!" Nancy immediately rejected. "This is my child, I won't have an abortion!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy!" Mick bent down, holding her face in his hands, looking at her calmly, soothing her excited emotions. "This is for your health. Your body is too injured, and every part needs time to recover. There will be another child in the future. How many children you want, I will give you. I promise to take good care of you in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How many children will you give me?" Nancy suddenly smiled bitterly. "How can you say that so lightly? This child and I have survived on the brink of life and death together! Everyone thought I was dead, but Miss Fowler insisted on saving me, so I can talk to you here now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shouted, touching her belly. The little life inside her was so vivid!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She could feel the fetal movement, even though she was lying in bed and couldn't move much due to her injuries. But every fetal movement made her want to live even more strongly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because only by living can she take care of this child in the future!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even felt that the reason she woke up was because of the child in her belly, because she wanted to give birth to it and become a mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now, I want to keep this child. As long as I am this child's mother, I will protect it!" Even if it's dangerous, she wants to take a chance!</p></div>
