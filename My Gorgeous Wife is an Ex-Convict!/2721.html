        <h1>Chapter 2719</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then why are people on the set treating me like this?" she asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It must have something to do with Brian. You were taken away by people from Hart Group, so everyone thinks you have Hart Group's higher-ups behind you. How could they treat you badly?" Camille Strickland replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was speechless. She had now become someone who got to where she was due to her connections. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, how are the things between you and Brian?" Camille Strickland gossiped curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing new." She was only pretending to be his girlfriend anyway. The only difference was that she used to do it out of sympathy. She had also suffered a bad experience in love, so she wanted to help him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it had gradually turned into gratefulness, and she wanted to repay him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were not for Brian, she might not be able to stand here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland muttered, "Maybe you should consider the possibility of making it real. After all, you have a chance many people would never have. Won&rsquo;t it be a pity if you&rsquo;re only 'pretending' to be his girlfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller chuckled. "Stop saying such things. Do you think someone like him would casually make a fake relationship real?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help thinking of the day he brought her to a party with his friends. That moment had made it even clearer to her that she and he were indeed worlds apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if there was a brief intersection, they would eventually drift apart again&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I only want to be a good 'girlfriend' during this period. I'll keep my heart in check. I won't overthink about the rest because I know I&rsquo;m incompatible with him," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After hearing what her best friend said, Camille Strickland somehow found her nose slightly sore. "How are you incompatible? Even if that person is Brian, you're&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough. I'm too old to dream. Camille, I admit I have a crush on him. It's hard not to be attracted to a man like him, but I also understand that he has no feelings for me. The reason he sent someone to save me at the film set was that I'm his fake girlfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said gently. She would only say what was on her mind in front of her best friend. "I don't want a fake relationship to turn real. If I take it seriously but he still regards it as a fake relationship, I&rsquo;ll be the only one to suffer in the end. So all I can do now is stay true to myself and not get caught up in my emotions."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland said with a guilty look, "I'm sorry!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She teased Valda and forgot that Valda would only get hurt again if she took her words seriously but Brian did not end up feeling the same way for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you apologizing? I know you only want me to start a new relationship," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I'll help you find a good man when you're done with Brian," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller could not help laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After finishing her work on the film set, she took the bus back to her apartment. However, she did not expect to find Raymond Bowman downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman's eyes lit up immediately when he saw her. He walked toward her, obviously waiting for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're... back," he said, looking a little flustered. He had purposely come to see her, but many words seemed stuck in his throat when he finally saw her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Raymond Bowman, I don't think we have anything to do with each other. I also hope we can avoid meeting as much as possible," said Valda Theller.</p></div>
