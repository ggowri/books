        <h1>Chapter 2229</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman looked at them from afar, disgust written all over her face. Kyla came with Martin Weiss, yet she denied it so blatantly! It was as if she took her for a fool!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid said thoughtfully, "Your friend isn't simple. There&rsquo;s no way a woman who has been to prison can make a man like Martin Weiss treat her like that if she didn&rsquo;t have some brains! However, a woman like that can never get an official title even if she&rsquo;s pregnant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A woman who has been to prison...' These words seemed to trigger Jacqueline Bowman, and her eyes darkened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was also a woman who had been to prison. Her past was taboo to her, but Neal Reid never cared about it in front of his friends. He would even make fun of the fact that she had been to prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, she could not help wondering if this meant that Neal Reid had no intention of giving her a title. Even if she bore him a son, perhaps he would still refuse to give her a title.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In his eyes, she was just a woman who had been to prison. He could fool around with her, but she was not worth marrying!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss accompanied Kyla over to Mrs. Corbyn and placed the plate of food in front of Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, if you want something more to eat, I'll get it for you," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No thanks. This is enough," Mrs. Corbyn said quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't I get some food for Kyla?" asked Martin Weiss. Then, he asked Kyla, "Is there anything you want to eat?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla replied, "No thanks, I'm not that hungry." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Even if you don't want to eat, the baby in your belly still needs some food. Sit with Mom. I'll go get you something."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, Martin Weiss went away to get some food. Mrs. Corbyn looked at Martin Weiss's leaving figure before looking at her daughter. "He cares about you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla bit her lip and stayed silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss came to the buffet area. Jacqueline Bowman walked up and said, "Hello, Mr. Weiss. Do you remember me? I'm Kyla's friend. We met a few days ago. My name is Jacqueline Bowman. You can call me Jacqueline."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She put on a bright smile and showed what she thought was a seductive look, hoping to attract Martin Weiss's attention. In Jacqueline Bowman's opinion, she was better looking and younger than Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even Kyla could capture Martin Weiss's attention, so maybe she could too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she caught Martin Weiss's attention, why would she settle for someone like Neal Reid?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked coldly at the woman in front of him. He could see right through women like her at a glance. After all, he had been surrounded by women like her over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you think you're Kyla's friend, it&rsquo;s best you behave like a friend and stop thinking about using her. I spared you last time because you helped Kyla when you were in prison. But you won't be so lucky next time," Martin Weiss said coldly.</p></div>
