        <h1>Chapter 1910</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was in pain due to the punches from before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not even know how many of the men&rsquo;s punches had landed on Lina. She could only protect Lina with all her might, but not her own body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina laboriously gasped for breath. Her face was bruised and swollen. She could barely keep one eye open. Though Grace hated these men, she could only say with a straight face, "Yes, I can promise you that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're gonna regret it if you listen to her. We have no other choice but to subdue them to have any chance of escaping!" Katherine Jackson said in a panic, afraid that the men she had spent a bomb on would rebel against her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, another voice rang out. "I can also assure you that all will be well if you let go of my wife and her friend. If you want to listen to what this woman said, then be prepared to lose your lives here today!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The group was instantly shocked. They looked in the direction of the voice and saw that several people had rushed over. They were blocking the only exit leading downstairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason was among them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though he was surrounded by the Reed family's bodyguards and security guards, Grace could still instantly spot him in the crowd.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was wearing a shirt, and his hair was messy from the helicopters&rsquo; thrashing propellers. His handsome face seemed to be exuding chills. Even when she met his gaze, those eyes seemed to be covered with a veil. She could not see them clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even so, the mere sight of him gave her a sense of relief!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The mercenaries looked at Jason, then at Grace as if weighing their options.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Everyone knew they were sitting ducks right now. There were helicopters in the sky, and the only exit was blocked, so there was no way out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The only card they could play right now was their two hostages.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, why don't you let us go now and transfer ten million into the account we designated? Then we can return Mrs. Reed and her friend to you." The leader of the mercenaries offered their conditions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay." Jason readily agreed and said, "But these two women can't suffer any more injuries!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"That depends on whether we can get away," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They had clearly put Katherine Jackson out of the picture. Katherine Jackson was an abandoned pawn now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Katherine Jackson looked flustered. She knew that the mercenaries would not take her with them even if they did manage to leave. If that was the case, her fate would be incomparably miserable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With this in mind, she suddenly rushed over to Grace, who was closer to her, and placed a dagger on her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't come over. I'll kill her right now if anyone comes over!"</p></div>
