        <h1>Chapter 2142</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, we tried to find the child before this but we couldn't find him after almost turning Emerald City inside out. Then, we came up with a piece of fake news about your daughter. We said that Tina was in critical condition after she was born to lure the child out," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina seemed quite regretful when she heard that. "What a pity. I was gonna thank him in person, but now I don't know when I'll see him again. Perhaps never."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No!" Grace said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked at her best friend in confusion, while Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney waited for what Grace would say next.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was immediately embarrassed. She looked at Tina Stephenson, who was in Mrs. Sweeney's arms, then she looked at Hadwin Stephenson, who was still asleep on the hospital bed. She smiled drily. "Well... the little boy made a deal with Hadwin Stephenson. He'll marry Tina when she grows up, so I guess... you&rsquo;ll be able to see him again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Uh..." Lina was dumbstruck. "A deal? Is it a serious deal?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It should be...," said Grace. Then, as if afraid that the Sweeney family might misunderstand Hadwin Stephenson, she quickly said, "Well, we thought that since the little boy could save you when you were in the delivery room, he could probably wake you up as well. And when we asked him to save you, he didn't say he couldn't. He just refused to do it, so..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"And then? And then what happened?" asked Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then, the man the little boy brought with him almost had a conflict with Jay and Martin Weiss. Hadwin Stephenson brought Tina over and knelt to the little boy, begging him to save you!" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's eyes watered instantly. An arrogant man like him would never kneel to others, but he went down on his knees to a little boy for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Even so, the child refused. Afterward, the child changed his mind because Tina cried. But he insisted that Tina marry him in the future before he was willing to save you. Hadwin Stephenson agreed so that you would wake up," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They all knew Hadwin Stephenson had no other choice but to agree to the request.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really..." murmured Lina. She turned to look at the man sleeping soundly beside her as her heart ached.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">How could she not love this man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, thank you for doing so much for me," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I didn't do anything. It's just that... the little boy is a member of the Hunter family. The Hunter family is mysterious. I don't know why the little boy insists on being with Tina. We don't know what will happen in the future..." Grace said somewhat uneasily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney were also worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina laughed. "The child doesn't seem like a bad person to me. Since he saved my daughter and me, I'll go with the flow. The legal marrying age is still 21 years old anyway. We can take our time to think of a solution."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace felt relieved at that. "You're right. We have 21 years. We'll think of a solution even if something does go wrong!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney seemed relieved too when they heard that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla and Martin Weiss also came to see Lina in the afternoon. Hadwin Stephenson was already awake. He had washed up and changed into clean casual clothes. His hair was combed, and his chin was shaved. He looked as handsome as ever, even though he was much thinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Oh, you're so thin that you're a little out of shape. I must take good care of you. We can't let your beauty go to waste." Lina used her finger to lift Hadwin Stephenson's chin as she sized him up. </p></div>
