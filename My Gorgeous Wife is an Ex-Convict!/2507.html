        <h1>Chapter 2505</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss woke up on the third day, Grace and Jason went into the isolation ward wearing isolation gowns.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your and Kyla's operations were successful. You can transfer to the regular ward in 24 hours. Kyla will take longer. She needs 72 hours," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Has she woken up?" Martin Weiss asked hoarsely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not yet, but the doctor said she&rsquo;ll wake up today," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't tell her that the liver in her body... is mine," reminded Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you saved Kyla, why won't you tell her?" Grace asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because I want a clean break-up with her," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But how can you have a clean break-up now that you have two children together?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss closed his eyes a little tiredly. "Then we'll have a clean break-up... except for the children..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had struggled in this hopeless relationship for years. He did not want to continue struggling in this relationship.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted to break up while he could!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Kyla woke up, no one mentioned the liver transplant to her. They only told her that the doctor gave her a minor liver surgery to keep her liver condition under control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The second day after Kyla was transferred to a regular ward, Martin Weiss was discharged from the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By the time Grace knew, Martin Weiss had been escorted out of Emerald City by car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss... left Emerald City just like that. He didn't even say goodbye to Kyla," Grace said emotionally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe he'll be reluctant to leave if he saw her," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nevertheless, Kyla finally managed to survive. It would be a shame for her and Martin Weiss to miss out on each other like this," Grace said regretfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So, what are you going to do?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I think I&rsquo;ll tell Kyla the truth when she recovers in two months. Kyla rejected Martin Weiss back then because she was worried about her health. She was afraid that Martin Weiss wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stand it and would die with her if she was no longer around. But if the transplant is successful, she can live much longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think Kyla will choose to be with Martin Weiss if she knows the truth?" Jason asked in reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla will do that as long as she loves Martin Weiss," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss covered all of Kyla&rsquo;s and the newborn's hospitalization expenses. He even topped up enough money in their account.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was getting better every day. Her sallow skin had also gradually restored to its normal complexion. The baby was still in the neonatal intensive care unit, but doctors brought them good news every day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If all went well, the child would be able to leave the intensive care unit and return to Kyla's side in another month.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Every day, Mrs. Corbyn would take photos of the little one and show them to her daughter in the ward.</p></div>
