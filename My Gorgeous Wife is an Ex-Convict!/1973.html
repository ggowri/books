        <h1>Chapter 1971</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Maybe he had forgiven her when she cried in the streets trying to restore the photos he deleted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He was just... too afraid to lose her again. He was scared that she was doing it for the baby and did not love him enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That was why he would not say he had &lsquo;forgiven&rsquo; her so easily. He only hoped that she could pester and love him more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the evening, Hadwin Stephenson booked a private room in an old yet famous restaurant in J City. He invited Lina's parents to have dinner together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at their daughter's smiling face, Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney were finally relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They had all sorts of misunderstandings about Hadwin Stephenson, but their daughter had explained everything to them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney raised his glass and said, "Hadwin, we've misunderstood you. You've done a lot for Lina. Lina was able to survive because of you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's eyes darkened a little. The events from back then were a pain he could not forget.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Those things wouldn't have happened to her if it hadn't been for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Sweeney quickly said, "Fortunately, it's all over. It's over now. We're happy for you! Lina's dad and I only hope the baby can be born safely and you&rsquo;ll get back together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, we will!" Lina said before Hadwin Stephenson could speak. She had not told her parents that she was still on probation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They enjoyed the meal together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson watched as the Sweeney family casually chatted, ate, and drank with smiles on their faces. The atmosphere seemed to be affecting him, which he had never felt before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Eating at the Stephenson family&rsquo;s house never felt like this, whether he ate with his mother or with other members of the Stephenson family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He never felt anything but indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Perhaps, he was the one unwilling to let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After finishing the meal, Hadwin Stephenson asked the driver to send the Sweeney family back. However, Lina stubbornly took Hadwin Stephenson's arm and said to her parents, "Mom, Dad, why don't you two go back to the hotel first? I... want to stay at Hadwin's place for a few more days."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She even looked up at him expectantly as she asked, "Can I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was speechless. She was already acting on the spot without prior approval. What else could he say? "Let her stay with me for a few days. I&rsquo;ll take good care of her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said to Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"We're sorry to bother you!" said Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney as they got in the Stephenson family's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The car slowly drove toward the hotel they were staying, while Lina got in Hadwin Stephenson's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I thought you'd go back to the hotel with your parents since the swelling has gone down," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She said cheekily, "I was hoping we could spend more time together! We've been apart for five years. Although I love you and you still love me, all those misunderstandings have taken a toll on our relationship. Don't you think we need to spend more time together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson realized that he did not hate spending more time with her. He was even happy about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina showed up in Hadwin Stephenson's room again that night, holding her pregnancy pillow.</p></div>
