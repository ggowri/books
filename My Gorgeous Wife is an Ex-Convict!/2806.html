        <h1>Chapter 2804</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It... It's broken... Ouch!" Rowena Santiago shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Y-Young Master Hart, how could you do this to an elderly?" Wynne asked as he quickly helped his mother to get up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said coldly, "So what? I told you, no one can hit Valda in front of me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young Master Hart, don't be charmed by her. She's a Jayx. Her parents would still be alive if it weren't for her! You can ask her if she killed her parents. She's a Jayx!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing that things had come to this, Wynne simply had a falling out with Valda Theller. Since Valda Theller was so stubborn, he would not give Valda Theller an easy time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian felt Valda Theller trembling, and her already pale face was now paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wynne &lsquo;earnestly&rsquo; said, "Young Master Hart, she's a Jayx who will only bring you bad luck. Be careful! It's like how my dad got fired from his old job and could only get a strenuous job soon after she came to my house. My mom was usually in good health, but she fell seriously ill because of her. I didn't do well in the senior high school entrance examination and the national college entrance examination either&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So you think it's all her fault?" Brian interrupted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It... It's all because of her. We also had someone look into her four pillars of destiny. She's bad luck!" Rowena Santiago added.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's funny how you have to blame someone else for your own problems." Brian stared coldly at the mother and son pair. "Then I can tell you now that Valda's lucky. If you didn't have her four pillars of destiny protecting you, you would&rsquo;ve ended miserably!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rowena Santiago and Wynne instantly shuddered as fear rose in their hearts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They then realized that the man standing before them was the crown prince of the entertainment industry who was famous for his cruelty and indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crown prince had never been kind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With panicked looks, the mother and son pair almost left in a hurry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked down at Valda Theller and said, "Don't mind what they said."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked down and pursed her lips for a long time before saying, "What if I do mind?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, how can I not mind? After my parents' death, I've been called a Jayx so often that I even doubt myself sometimes.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you mind it, I'll find a way to make sure they can never criticize you again," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller stared blankly at Brian, not expecting him to say that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You don't think I can do it?" he asked as he raised his eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She shook her head. "No, you can do it. It's just..." She took a deep breath and said after summoning her courage, "I don't care what they say about me, but I'll cause something bad to happen to you someday if I'm really a Jayx."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes glimmered before he said indifferently, "I&rsquo;ve never believed in superstitions, and neither should you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you expect me to believe that and break up with you?" he interrupted her.</p></div>
