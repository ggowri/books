        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This..." Jasper murmured, staring intently at the set of toys in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know if it's the same set from back then, so I brought you here to take a look. I asked the shop owner, and he said it was on consignment from someone else, who only said they got it from a small vendor. But now we can't find that small vendor," William explained. "Did you have any special markings on that set of toys back then? Anything that could help identify it?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper paused for a moment. If it was a mark, she remembered accidentally bumping into this set of toys when she was a child. There should be a mark on the corner of the wooden house's roof.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked towards the roof of the toy house and found the mark she remembered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So...this set of toys was really the one Lawrence lost! Thinking of this, Jasper's eyes became moist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is this the one?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" She nodded. She never thought that after so many years, she could find this set of toys again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William then said to the shopkeeper, "Please wrap up this set of toys."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The shopkeeper was overjoyed and quickly wrapped up the toy. After all, this set of toys was not cheap here, and the two people in front of him were both dressed in high-end clothes. They were probably very wealthy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, the other party didn't even ask for the price and just asked to wrap up the toy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you need anything else? I have many antique toys here, some of which are brand new," the shopkeeper enthusiastically introduced.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, thank you," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After the toy was wrapped up, William carried it and walked out of the store with Jasper. "Do you want to keep looking around?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This thing is heavy. Let's put it back in the car first," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," William agreed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How did you find this toy?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw it while scrolling through short videos online, and then I found this store. When I saw this set of toys, I thought it looked like the one you gave to Lawrence back then, so I brought you here to confirm it today. I never thought it would be the one," William explained.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why...why did you do this?" She hesitated for a moment before asking.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" He paused in his steps, looking at her with some confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She lifted her head to meet his gaze. "This set of toys, I gave it to Lawrence. You went through so much trouble to help me find something I gave to Lawrence. Don't you...um..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip, considering what words to use.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you jealous?" William took the initiative to continue the conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper seemed a bit embarrassed and responded with a "Hmm." He thought of asking this because his father had asked her before, "Do you really like William?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes." She had answered confidently at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about Lawrence? What does he mean to you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's my friend, a friend I hope can be safe and happy." She replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you only see Lawrence as a friend, then don't get too close to him." Her father had said, "Since you've found him now and proved that he's not dead, then keep some distance from him in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why?" She was confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her father had looked at her for a long time before sighing and saying, "Because people's hearts are fickle."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was still puzzled.</span></p></div>
