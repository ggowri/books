        <h1>Chapter 3828</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica loves Mason, otherwise she wouldn't have chosen to risk her life to move the rocks for Mason in such a dangerous situation," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had also seen the video taken by the drone, so she understood how dangerous the </span><span>situation was at the time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not saying she doesn't love him. Let me put it this way," Mick said, "If Veronica misses Mason, she won't meet another person who loves her so much, so she naturally wouldn't want to miss him."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at her older brother. She had known since she was a child that her older brother was very smart. Even many technical experts couldn't solve the problems that her older brother could easily solve.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sometimes, she even felt that her older brother's intelligence was not like that of a real person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She remembered when she was a child, she had asked her father why her older brother was so smart, but she didn't get any of the intelligence. She said her older brother was too perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The result was that her father said that there were no perfect people in this world. If God gave you something, you would inevitably lose something.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she didn't understand what that meant.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, when she grew up, she read a book. In the book, there was a supporting character who was brave, upright, and incorruptible, and was praised by everyone as a wise monarch. Even this wise monarch had never made any mistakes in his life, and died heroically on the battlefield, becoming the embodiment of perfection in people's hearts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But in the evaluations of later generations, someone revealed the privacy of this wise monarch. When he died, the throne was vacant, and there was not a single concubine in the harem. It was not because he had a secret lover, nor was it because he only drank one sip from the three thousand weak waters. It was because he had never loved anyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He devoted all his passion to the country and the people, constantly fighting and achieving countless victories. As a result, he had no energy left to love someone properly, and he didn't even know what it felt like to love someone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>While reading this book, she wasn't moved by the love story of the main characters. Instead, she kept thinking about the supporting character and felt a heavy feeling in her chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At the time, William laughed at her for getting too involved in the book!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then she vaguely understood what her father meant when he said those words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For some people, if they have exceptional talent in one area, they may be lacking in another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Brother, it seems like you've never had a girlfriend before. If you really fall in love, you'll understand that even if you love someone more than anyone else in the world, it's not a necessary condition for that person to love you back. Loving each other is ultimately up to the two people. Veronica is willing to marry Mason not just because he loves her more than anyone else in the world, but because she loves Mason more than anyone else in the world!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick raised an eyebrow, surprised by his sister's words. He didn't expect her to say something like that.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although they were the same age, Mick always felt like his sister was still a little girl.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But today, he realized that Jasper had really grown up.</span></p></div>
