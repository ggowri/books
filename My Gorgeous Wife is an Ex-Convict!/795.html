        <h1>Chapter 794</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the hospital's VIP ward, Old Master Reed sat back on the bed and looked at his grandson who was sitting a few steps away. "I heard you broke up with that woman?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked calm as if he was not surprised that Old Master Reed knew about it so soon after it happened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Reed Residence of course had the old master's informant. Even though the old man had been hospitalized for a long time, he probably knew exactly what was going on in Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, we broke up," Jason said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You should&rsquo;ve listened to me from the beginning. That woman is just not right for you!" Old Master Reed's previously cloudy eyes now looked sharply at his grandson. "It's a good thing that you're not like your father. You know how to stop before it's too late, or you'll end up just like your father!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason suddenly sneered from the corner of his lips and raised his eyes to meet Old Master Reed's. "It was probably you who arranged for the psychiatrist with the last name &lsquo;Leng&rsquo; to come to Reed Residence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, a flash of surprise came across Old Master Reed's face, but he readily admitted. "Yes, I asked someone to bribe this doctor to go to Reed Residence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not expect his grandson to find out so quickly, which surprised him a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grandpa, you went to a lot of trouble to get me to break up with Grace," Jason said in a cold voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just helped you figure it out. You're the one who made the decision, is it not? She's the girl Brian is really looking for. I'm surprised you did so much in secret because you were afraid that she&rsquo;d go to Brian," said Old Master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed followed the psychiatrist's clues and got people to investigate it. However, the more they investigated, the more frightened he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had gone to so much trouble just to keep Grace by his side. However, the more he did, the more it represented how much his grandson loved her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Naturally, he knew that if he simply forced Grace to leave Jason, then the final result would probably be the same as the last time&mdash;Jason would protect the woman. In the end, nothing would change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he took a different approach this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The final result was to his satisfaction. His grandson and Grace had finally broken up!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's thin lips pressed together in a straight line as he stared at the old man who had raised him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone in the Reed family liked to control others, just like how he wanted to control Grace while his grandfather wanted to control his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'We do have the same blood and genes, but&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason stood up and walked slowly to Old Master Reed's bedside. He bent down, and his bright eyes seemed bloodthirsty with rage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin, sexy lips opened and closed as he said, "Don't try to control me, Grandpa. If you try to play the same trick again next time, maybe I'll really disrespect you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed's pupils suddenly shrank, but Jason had already straightened up and walked out of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the ward, only Old Master Reed and his private secretary were left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed suddenly began to laugh. "Well, well, he really is a child of the Reed family. He's cruel!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's so cruel he won't even acknowledge his family!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only in this way could the Reed family continue to stand tall in Emerald City!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Master Reed's laughter filled the cold ward!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason got into the car, and the car drove toward Reed Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked down at his hands. For a moment when he was in the ward, he had felt an urge to kill.</p></div>
