        <h1>Chapter 3451</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the following days, Mason did not return to the Barlow family, but instead stayed with the Reed family. Every time after school, Veronica watched as Mason parted ways with her and got into another car, which brought back a feeling of loneliness once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel, on the other hand, knowing that Veronica was going home alone, took the initiative to say to her, "I'll walk you home from now on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are you giving me a ride?" Veronica asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Right, I'm your boyfriend now, aren't I? Taking you home, no big deal," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But my dad and them don't know yet!" said Veronica. After all, she hasn't told her family about her relationship with Daniel yet!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I'll just drop you off near your home before leaving," said Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, they are still students, and most people wouldn't tell their parents about dating at this stage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason returned to the Reed House and was doing homework alone in his room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, someone knocked on his door, and after a moment, Mick walked in by pushing the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's up?" asked Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick asked, "I noticed you've been staying at home every day recently. Are you not planning to go back to the Barlow family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't plan to for now," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you have a fight with Veronica?" Mick asked, showing concern for his younger brother's relationship despite not being a gossip person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," Mason replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you didn't fight, then why do you keep going home all the time?" Mick asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I keep living with the Barlow family, then I can only be her little brother in her eyes," Mason explained. He was too familiar with her, and she had a deep-rooted impression of him as a little brother that she saw almost all the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick remained silent for a moment before asking, "You don't want to just be her little brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I don't," Mason said, looking straight at Mick. "Bro, have you ever wanted someone so much that you just want that person to be with you all the time, never wanting to be apart, and that person is irreplaceable?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick was shocked by Mason's words. Although he vaguely understood how important Veronica was to his younger brother, hearing it from Mason's mouth was a different feeling altogether.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No," Mick replied. For him, family was the most important thing, and he didn't have anyone else he wanted that badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The longer Mason stayed with the Reed family, the more tense the atmosphere became with the Barlow family. Archer and Rosalind were always wearing a frown, and Lionel was constantly advising his sister, "Sis, if you have a fight with Mason, just give in to him. As long as you give in, he won't stay away from home, will he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Here is not his home, his true home is with the Reed family," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel said unhappily, "Sis, why do you keep saying that the Reed family is his home? What are you really thinking? Do you not want Mason to come back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica pursed her lips and didn't respond to her brother's words.</p></div>
