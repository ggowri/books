        <h1>Chapter 920</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason was topless with a towel around his waist. His hair was wet and dripping with water.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing Grace in the room, he smiled. "You're here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes." She looked away uncomfortably.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you embarrassed?" He came up to her. "Aren't you going to help me dry my hair? I remember the first time you took me to your rental house that you offered to dry my hair when I came out of the shower, Sis."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're a little too tall for me to dry your hair. Why don't you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before she could finish, he bent down. "Can you do it now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His sudden approach startled her, and when she turned her head, her eyes met his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes seemed to have some kind of magic that one could not help looking at.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he put a dry towel in her hands. "I like it when you help me to dry my hair."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace held the towel almost stiffly. She put it over his head and began drying his wet hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The towel managed to block his eyes, giving her a sense of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not only did she help him dry his wet hair many times when they were living in the rental house, but she had also done the same when she lived in Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she was now doing the familiar action in a completely different mood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After drying his wet hair, Jason ran his fingers through his bangs. "My hair seems to have grown a bit. Why don't you trim it for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can get a professional hairstylist to cut your hair. I don't know how to cut it." She rejected almost subconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you hate liars the most, Sis? When we were in the rental house, didn't you trim my hair?" Jason said with a smirk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked. 'Is he planning to do all the things we&rsquo;ve done in the rental house?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now she wished she had not done so many things with him in the rental house</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We don't have the tools here." She had to find another excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was speechless when he asked his servant to bring him a complete set of hair styling tools.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were a lot of tools that she did not know how to use.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, she could only take the most basic comb and a pair of scissors to trim his hair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt a strange sensation as she ran her fingers through his wet hair. Then, she began to trim it with the scissors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if they were back in time when she would dry and trim his hair as he sat obediently in a chair.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was so absorbed in her thoughts that the scissors slipped out of her hands. It was about to stab Jason's neck, but two of his fingers caught it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you trying to kill me, Sis?" asked Jason as he looked at Grace in the mirror in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm&hellip; sorry. I zoned out," she said.</p></div>
