        <h1>Chapter 1858</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jasper thinks of William as her friend!" At least that was how she saw it. Some friends were for a lifetime!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really? Then let's see if William is a friend or a toy," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, they had not come to a conclusion in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace told her daughter not to go to William's room to sleep but it was to no avail. Even if she watched her daughter fall asleep in her room, she would surely find her daughter in William's room the next morning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Therefore, Grace could only let things develop on their own for the time being! Fortunately, the children were only five years old, so she did not have to worry too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed was still awake. He stared at Grace with those peach blossom eyes that were similar to Jason's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's the matter? Do you want me to read you a bedtime story before going to sleep, Mick?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Did you and Daddy have a fight? " the little one asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze. Then, she forced a smile. "What makes you think Daddy and I are fighting?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Because Daddy said yesterday that he would come home early for dinner today, but I called Daddy's phone and couldn't get through. Besides, you look unhappy, yet you pretend to be happy," the little one analyzed and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace immediately felt embarrassed. A five-year-old child had seen through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Daddy and I are fine. We just have different opinions. Don't worry, we'll make up," said Grace as she rubbed her son's tiny head gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed looked at Grace seriously. "Are you really going to make up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then... let's make a pinky promise." The little one held out his pinky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze, still remembering how she had made a pinky promise with Jay not long after meeting him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Who taught you to do this?" she could not help asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Daddy. He says doing this means you'll keep your word, but Daddy forgot who taught him. Daddy says there's no going back once you lock your pinkies!" said Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's nose felt sore. Jay probably had not recovered his memory at that time, so he did not remember!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, even though he had forgotten her at the time, he still remembered making pinky promises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay, let's make a pinky promise." Grace reached out and locked her pinky with her son. Then, she bumped their thumbs together. "I'll make up with Daddy. I promise!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one smiled in satisfaction and obediently went back to bed. He closed his eyes and soon fell asleep. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at her son's sleeping face, and her eyes fell on her hand that she used to make a pinky promise with her son just now. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Yeah, I'll make up with Jay!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she had no idea where he was right now, and his phone had been switched off since just now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'The place he might be... There are a few of the Reed family's mansions and Reed group&rsquo;s building...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace thought for a moment before getting up and going downstairs. She told Uncle Kwan, "Uncle Kwan, I'm going out to find Jay. Call me immediately if Jay comes back!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But it's so late now..." Uncle Kwan said with concern.</p></div>
