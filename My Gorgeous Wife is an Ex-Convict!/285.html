        <h1>Chapter 284</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go on about your sister," Brian muttered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh? Go on... like this?" Evelyn said, embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. Just like that," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn had to go on saying what she remembered about Grace while cursing Grace in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was just a sanitation service worker and had even been to prison. Even if she came from a good background, three years in prison was enough to shatter anyone&rsquo;s reputation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What did Brian&hellip; see in Grace?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inexplicably, Evelyn had a feeling that Brian had not broken up with her only because she was Grace's sister.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The thought, of course, only came up for a moment and was immediately pinned down by her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... Then, my sister met Sean. Sean had wooed her for a while, and one time, she twisted her ankle while climbing a mountain, so Sean carried her on his back down the mountain. Sis later agreed to date Sean. They were quite sweet back then, and Sis would always make lunch for Sean..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was trying her best to describe the sweetness of Grace's relationship with Sean. She wanted Brian to know that Grace already had a man she loved. Unlike her, Evelyn, who never had a boyfriend before. Brian was her first boyfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, Evelyn felt the hand that covered her eyes loosen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At last, her eyes saw light. What came into Evelyn's eyes were Brian's phoenix eyes. "Did she date Sean just because Sean carried her down the mountain?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice was as indifferent as ever, but it seemed to contain a faint ripple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes... Yes..." Evelyn stammered. She just felt that the aura coming out of his body was like a sharp blade, making people who got close to him feel terrible pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes lowered gently. "You can leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What? For a moment, Evelyn was a little overwhelmed and sat still where she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why are you still here?" Brian said as he frowned slightly, somewhat displeased.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn finally got to her feet and hurried out of the private room. Just before she left, she could not help glancing at Brian one last time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, at the moment, Brian hung his head slightly and seemed to be thinking about something. He did not even look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn bit her lip. It was all right, she had achieved her purpose today and Brian promised to give her another film.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As long as she grabbed hold of the resources and used them until she became a popular celebrity or the best actress, Brian's eyes would naturally focus on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for Grace, even though Grace was now involved with Jason, at the end of the day, Grace was still Jason's enemy and the murderer who killed his former fianc&eacute;e.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn was now convinced that Jason defending Grace was just a means to cause her to fail due to excessive attention. The more she was pampered now, the worse she would fall in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just the rich&rsquo;s way to take revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn left the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was the only person left in the huge private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Brian took out the little silver bracelet and stared at the silver bracelet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What Evelyn had said just now made him think again of the past, except that when they escaped back then, it was the little girl who carried him on her back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not even know how her tiny body managed to carry him who was a little older than she was.</p></div>
