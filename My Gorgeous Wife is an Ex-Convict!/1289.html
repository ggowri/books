        <h1>Chapter 1288</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's... Grace's voice!' Jason seemed to come back to his senses all of a sudden. His dark eyes that were filled with rage started clearing up bit by bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, let go. I don't care what this man says. You don't have to care either! There's no need to dirty your hands because of someone like him!" Grace said worriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You... don't care?" murmured Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I don't care!" She gave him an affirmative answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers finally loosened slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins made a narrow escape from death. He was so shocked he could not utter a word, while Melinda Riley was trembling badly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Glancing at her father and stepmother, Grace said coldly, "As for Evelyn, she deserves the consequences of what she has done. I won't do anything to help, nor will I bother to get even. As for you two, we're not family anymore. Jay&rsquo;s my only family now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said and strode into the mansion, holding Jason's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins and Melinda Riley were still in shock that they could not even utter a single word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason followed close behind Grace. His mind still echoed the words she said just now. She said he was her only family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed to be the most beautiful thing he had ever heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stopped and turned to look at Jason once they entered the main house. "You don't need to get all riled up over people like that. It's not worth it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason fixed his gaze on Grace. She would not understand the panic that had risen in his heart when he heard Tony Cummins saying that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they were in the hospital, she had said that if she were Kyla Corbyn, she would not forgive Martin Weiss who put Kyla Corbyn in prison with only a testimony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Tony Cummins was right. He was no different from them. When she was unjustly imprisoned, he had chosen to look on coldly like them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could say that he was even worse. He knew who the real culprit was, but he did not care that an innocent person was bearing a crime that was not hers and suffering so much pain in prison because of his indifference!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure you don't mind?" murmured Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I don't mind, so you shouldn&rsquo;t mind it too," she said with a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I... really did nothing when you... were unjustly imprisoned." The words escaped his mouth with so much difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "You didn't know that I was wronged! All the witnesses and physical evidence pointed to me. Someone deliberately framed me to make me the murderer. It was only natural for you to think that I was the murderer. It's not your fault. You don't have to blame yourself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the pain in his eyes seemed to grow deeper. How could he not blame himself? If he had been a little more sympathetic to her, who was a stranger, she would not have suffered all of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Speaking of which, Jennifer is the most innocent one. At least I'm still alive, but Jennifer lost her life. Jay, do you still think of Jennifer?" Grace said with some sorrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sometimes, but it has nothing to do with feelings. I never had any feelings for Jennifer. I only chose her because Grandpa thought she was suitable for the Reed family. I thought I would never fall in love with anyone in my life, so back then, I didn&rsquo;t mind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said and took Grace's hand. He pressed her palm against his cheek, muttering, "Fortunately, you're alive... If I had known I was going to meet you, I would never have let myself get involved with any other woman. I would&rsquo;ve waited for you alone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the direction of the accident had slightly deviated or if she had gotten out of the car a little later, she might not be here today.</p></div>
