        <h1>Chapter 4067</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hehe, help me pick out some good-looking clothes," Tina patted her friend's back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Picking out clothes is no problem, but if Chandler asks why you thought of using men's clothing to test him, please don't mention my name!" Eugenia reminded her. She didn't want to die young!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No problem!" Tina readily agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them picked out clothes quickly, and as for the wig, Tina had bought some before for her previous shoots, so she just needed to go back and get them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as they were leaving the mall, Eugenia couldn't help but ask again, "Are you really planning to test Chandler?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why else do you think I bought these?" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Eugenia took a deep breath and solemnly patted her friend's shoulder. She had a thousand words to say, but in the end, it all boiled down to two words: "Take care!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After returning home, Tina told her family that she was going to spend the night at Chandler's place again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Again? And what's in this big bag of yours?" Lina asked her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Oh, it's props for the shoot. I'm taking them over and will tidy up while I'm there," Tina made up a reason on the spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "By the way, my daughter is getting more and more handsome. Remember to give me a copy of the photos you take of her!" Lina reminded her, knowing and supporting her daughter's cosplay photos.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She even dragged her husband, Hadwin, to take a set of cosplay photos because she thought her daughter looked so handsome in men's clothing. She kept saying that when she was young, she never thought of having Hadwin take more of these cosplay photos, which was a waste of his good figure and looks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> After "being forced" to take that set of cosplay photos, Hadwin sternly warned his daughter that it was okay to continue taking these cosplay photos in the future, but she must convince her mother not to let her father take any more cosplay photos!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> For the sake of her hobby, Tina finally used her persuasive skills to convince her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Of course, the most powerful argument she used to persuade her mother was, "Mom, if you really want Dad to cosplay those anime or movie characters, let him cosplay in the room for you. You can watch it alone, isn't that great? If you really want to take photos, just take them yourself. Why let others take them? Dad looks so good, aren't you afraid that others will covet him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Lina was finally convinced by her daughter, and they began a new "bedroom pleasure" with her husband.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Although Hadwin didn't like cosplay very much, he said he could accept it because of his wife's enthusiasm. After all, only his wife would see it, so he didn't feel embarrassed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> When Hadwin returned home at night, he learned from his wife that their daughter had gone to Chandler's place again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Again?" Hadwin frowned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Even though their daughter and Chandler were engaged, and even though Chandler's family background was impeccable, as a father, he still had a feeling that his daughter was going to be taken advantage of.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "They're engaged, so it's not a big deal. Besides, Chandler knows his limits," Lina said, feeling very confident about her future son-in-law.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Even if he knows his limits, he's still a man," Hadwin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> As a man himself, he knew that sometimes, in the face of desire, self-control was not as strong as one might imagine.</p></div>
