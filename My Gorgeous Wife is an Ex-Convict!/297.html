        <h1>Chapter 296</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason said nothing more. He straightened up, closed the car door, walked around to the driver's seat, and started the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was a little surprised to see Jason drive. Usually, the driver drove the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, because he was driving, she was able to look at his side profile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She had to admit that from the side, she seemed to see more of the solid, clear outline of his features&mdash;that straight nose bridge of his and those sexy thin lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Currently, his hair was not as neat as usual. There were a few strands of hair across his forehead. He looked more like the Jay she had known before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jay&hellip; The thought of the name gave her a complicated feeling. She kept calling him &lsquo;Jay&rsquo; just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Was it because she subconsciously thought only Jay could help her but not Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, whether it was Jay or Jason, it was him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now, he was the only person she could turn to for help. Even though the police were looking for Lina, but... she still wanted more people to join in the search.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">It would be best if they could find Lina soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When the car stopped at a traffic light, Jason turned his head to look at Grace and said, "What's wrong? Why do you keep looking at me like that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was stunned, not realizing that he had noticed her looking at him. "No... Nothing, just wondering why you&rsquo;re the one driving today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She stammered, embarrassed to be caught spying on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes, I'm the one driving today..." he said as if amused. His eyes darkened as he looked at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">How was he going to tell her that when he heard her sobbing on the phone, he was so anxious that he lost his usual composure and grabbed the car keys without even notifying the driver?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Do you want to know why?" He stared at her with a heavy gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her heart seemed to skip a beat. His gaze made her feel awkward. A feminine instinct made her feel that the answer had something to do with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just when she did not know what to say, the red light at the intersection turned green. She quickly said, "It's green."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He looked at her but said no more on the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The car drove back to the Reed Residence, and Grace followed Jason out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"When will I hear news about Lina?" Grace asked, unable to contain her anxiety when it had only been at most half an hour since Jason called someone to check on her best friend's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was probably afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Afraid that something had happened to Lina...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was even thinking about some of the kidnapping case studies she had seen when she was a law student. When the ones kidnapped were young women, nine times out of ten, it would not end up well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">'No, Lina's going to be fine. She'll be all right!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace kept saying to herself, her almond-shaped eyes looking at Jason so intently that he felt as if he was being stared at by some pitiful small creature.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">The pleading and expectation in her eyes were especially clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">When he saw her like this, he even felt an urge to hold her in his arms. He desperately wanted to wipe the pleading and expectation from her eyes as they were there only because of Lina.</p></div>
