        <h1>Chapter 3239</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William listened quietly, and his eyes gradually became clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What he wants is not just to play the piano well to please Jasper, but also to stand by her side in the future, become a stronger presence, and get the person he desires.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, for him, the piano is actually not the most important thing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He has many more important things to accomplish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I understand," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Now that you understand, go to bed. There are things to do tomorrow," said Philip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William nodded and followed his father out of the music room. But as he left, he glanced back at the piano, lost in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Philip patted his son's shoulder. "Well, since it was your decision, don't regret it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William pursed his lips and looked up at his father with a determined gaze. "I won't regret it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, half a month later, William suddenly came to Emerald City on a weekend, claiming that Philip had business to attend to here and he came along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a father, Philip naturally wouldn't expose his son's lie. He came here for business, but he could have sent someone else to handle it. He didn't have to come in person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The main reason for coming to Emerald City was that his son was thinking about Jasper. That's why they came from Deer Capital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, in the Reed family's mansion, Lawrence met William for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Jasper had shown her a photo of William before, it wasn't until she actually met him that she truly felt that sense of oppression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person was taller than him and was wearing clothes that didn't look cheap. The servants respectfully called him Mr. Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Jasper saw the other person, he immediately rushed over and naturally hugged them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's happiness was so evident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"William, this is Lawrence," Jasper introduced, then turned to Lawrence and said, "Lawrence, this is William."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two boys were staring at each other, it was their first formal meeting and they were sizing each other up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William appears calm, while Lawrence seems a bit uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hello, Lawrence," said William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You...hello, Mr. Barlow," Lawrence stuttered in response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Jasper has been saying that you play the piano very well. Can you play a piece for me to listen to?" William asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course...I can," Lawrence quickly replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This is a gift I prepared for you when I came. I hope you like it," William politely said, then took out a beautifully wrapped small box and handed it to Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence was pleasantly surprised to receive a gift.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's eyes lit up and she asked, "What about me, William? Did you bring me a gift?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course I did," William said, taking out a butterfly hair clip and placing it in Jasper's hand. "I saw this and thought it was pretty, so I wanted to give it to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a beautiful butterfly hair clip with pink and purple crystals embedded in the wings and eyes. Jasper's face immediately lit up with a big smile, clearly showing that she liked the gift.</p></div>
