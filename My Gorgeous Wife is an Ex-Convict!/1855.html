        <h1>Chapter 1853</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, her mentor's voice kept on ringing, begging her to plead for Mrs. Watts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Without her mentor, her life in L City would have been much harder, and Jasper would have suffered even more with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts had also helped her so many times. When she was busy with her work, Mrs. Watts often took care of Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay! Let Mrs. Watts stop!" Grace finally looked up and said to Jason, "Mrs. Watts just got out of the hospital, and her body won&rsquo;t be able to take it. I know you hate her, but there are other ways if you want her to atone for her sins!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason slowly turned his head and looked Grace in the eye. "So you still wish to plead for her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She gritted her teeth and uttered the word yes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You know full well what she did to my father and me!&rdquo; he continued saying. He looked at her with eyes filled with melancholic disappointment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace thought his gaze was pressing on her chest like an invisible mountain, and she could hardly breathe from the pressure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I do. I know everything, but my mentor and his wife have been kind to me. Jay, I beg you to let Mrs. Watts stop. Mrs. Watts is really different from before,&rdquo; said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What if I refuse?" His voice grew colder. "Grace, shouldn't I be the one you love and care about the most? Yet now you're pleading for the woman who nearly killed me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can plead for anyone but her!" It was because she was the woman he had sworn never to forgive on the night his father froze to death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace stared blankly at the man in front of her. Her throat was so dry that every word seemed stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Old Lawyer Watts suddenly screamed. Grace immediately looked over and saw Mrs. Watts's body leaning sideways. However, moments later, Mrs. Watts straightened herself with difficulty and continued to kowtow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts knelt in front of Jason when he saw this. "Jason, I beg you. Let your mother go. If you want her to atone for her sins, I'll do it for her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts started kowtowing as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace immediately cried, "Mentor, don't!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Old Lawyer Watts did not stop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was anxious, but there was nothing she could do now. The only thing she could do was...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She fell to her knees in front of Jason. "Jay, let Mrs. Watts stop. Don't let it go on. Something bad will happen if you let her continue like this!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His fingers, which had been holding her wrist, suddenly loosened. His cold eyes seemed to be tinged with sarcasm while a curve appeared on his thin lips. It looked more like a cry than a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, you knelt in front of me for Brian and Lina. Now, you're kneeling in front of me for your mentor and the woman who once hurt me? You can kneel in front of me for so many people. Do you really think of me as the person who matters the most to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, I..." Grace suddenly realized that maybe she was wrong and she should not be begging him in such a way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kneeling like this would only hurt him more.</p></div>
