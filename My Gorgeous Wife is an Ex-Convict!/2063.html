        <h1>Chapter 2061</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at the swelling on Nelson's face, Grace was relieved to learn that it was nothing but skin trauma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, upon the sight of the wounds on Nelson Corbyn's face, Jasper Reed's pretty almond-shaped eyes welled up with tears before she started crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She shocked everyone there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After all, the one with the red and swollen face had not cried yet, but she, who was not hurt at all, was crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little one not only cried but also grabbed Nelson Corbyn with both hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't cry. Don't cry!" Nelson Corbyn hastened to comfort her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace also said, "What happened? Jasper, why are you crying?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I just think... Nelson must be in so much pain!" The little one sobbed. It used to hurt so much when her mother hit her on the palm because she did something wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, her palm only reddened a little, unlike Nelson's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It doesn&rsquo;t hurt. Stop crying," said Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper blinked, tears still hanging from her lashes. "Really?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, it just looks a little red and swollen. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt anymore," said Nelson Corbyn. It still hurt, but he did not want Jasper to be sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn said as he wiped Jasper Reed's tears with a tissue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper sniffed before finally lifting her little hand to touch Nelson Corbyn's cheek. "Does it really not hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, it doesn't hurt. Jasper, thank you!" Nelson Corbyn said with a smile. Jasper's tears melted his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If anyone beats Nelson up in the future, I&rsquo;ll help you beat them! Daddy has asked someone to teach me self-defense. I&rsquo;ll protect Nelson!" Jasper said seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson Corbyn said, "That's great. I'm counting on it! I&rsquo;ll protect Jasper too!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He also made a promise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed looked at Nelson Corbyn thoughtfully as if thinking of something. Meanwhile, William looked at Jasper without blinking for a long while before lowering his head. His pearly whites bit his lower lip firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After leaving the store and getting into the car, William still kept his head down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed suddenly asked Grace, "Mommy, why would someone hurt Nelson? Is it just because he can&rsquo;t hear?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace thought about it before saying, "Because some people feel superior and look down on those with defects. I don't want you to be like them." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mick Reed and Jasper obediently nodded their little heads.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace touched William's tiny head again. "William, what's come over you? You've been keeping your head down ever since getting into the car. Is there something on your mind?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">William looked up at Grace and shook his head obediently. "No, I have nothing on my mind."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace smiled gently. "Then I hope you can remember what I just said. Even if you&rsquo;re superior one day, don't look down on those who are weaker than you, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew that the child in front of her was from the Barlow family of Deer City. Since Philip Barlow had come to look for him, he must be confident in retrieving him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Besides, Philip Barlow did not have any children, so William was his only child for now.</p></div>
