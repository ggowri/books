        <h1>Chapter 747</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin sometimes felt that many of his firsts had been created by Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For example, she was the first woman who got drunk and got on top of him. She did all the things she should have done and should not have done.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, for the first time, he was dumped by a woman the next day without a word.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, for the first time, he had been asked to share a link to such gossip news in Messenger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had she ever wondered who he had in his Messenger?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he had heard her talk about the things between Lily and Grace before. As such, he knew that she detested Lily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was not afraid of offending the Atkinson family. After all, he had offended many people to get to where he was now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However&hellip; Hadwin slightly narrowed his eyes and replied Lina in Messenger, &lsquo;Why should I do this favor for you?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A moment later, Lina replied, &lsquo;Because you're my boyfriend!&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was accompanied by a kneeling meme.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was a little amused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, this girl would make him jump to his feet in anger, but sometimes, she made him find her adorable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that only when he was with her could he really relax and ignore the cheating and backstabbing that happened before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was why he had always been thinking about her and looking for her. When he found her, he could not execute the revenge plans he had in his mind on her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He even tied her to him, saying that they were a couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her mind was full of longing to see when his revenge would be over so that he could leave her alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who&rsquo;d live so well if someone&rsquo;s taking revenge on them? Why didn't she think of this? If I wanted to get back at her, would I accompany her to eat all her favorite foods, scour small bookstores for comic books, and even help her book tickets to her idol's concert?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he thought of this, Hadwin had a faint headache again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Maybe... Maybe it&rsquo;d be better if she liked fewer idols!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While thinking, Hadwin actually shared the gossip news Lina just sent to his Facebook Moments.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of the senior executives in the company had the president's Messenger. After the meeting ended, these senior executives saw their president, who rarely posted anything in Moments, posting a piece of gossip news about a female celebrity being blacklisted in the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Along with that news, their president also included a caption. &lsquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ve shared as you requested. Are you satisfied?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All of a sudden, everyone who saw the post was wondering who the &lsquo;you&rsquo; was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that President Stephenson was still begging for their approval. It was even requested by this &lsquo;you&rsquo;!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nowadays, how many people could request President Stephenson to do something? Even the Stephenson family's madam, who Hadwin should respectfully call &lsquo;Aunty&rsquo;, could not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, the senior executives who saw the post did not know if they should like the post or comment on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina immediately saw that Hadwin had shared the gossip news to his Moments, so she was quick to like it and left a comment below. &lsquo;I'm satisfied!&rsquo;</p></div>
