        <h1>Chapter 3605</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper raised his hand and hugged William back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm here," she said softly. "William, no matter what happens, I will always be by your side. So, please don't turn off your phone without saying anything anymore. Don't make me unable to find you. It makes me anxious!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, he held her even tighter. After a while, he slowly uttered a word, "Okay!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>... After they came down from the cemetery, Jasper said to William, "I'm hungry."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then let's find a nearby place to eat first," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Because they were in the vicinity of the cemetery and it was already late, there were limited dining options nearby. Eventually, the two of them found a small, shabbily decorated shop.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you don't want to eat here, we can drive a bit further and probably find more places," William suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, this place is fine!" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After they both sat down, they placed their orders.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William took out his previously turned-off phone, turned it back on, and saw several missed calls and messages.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And just from Jasper's phone calls alone, there have been 5!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You made 5 phone calls?" he looked at her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was worried about you. You suddenly turned off your phone, and I couldn't find you anymore," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then how did you find this place later?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"First, I checked the school's surveillance footage and found that you left the campus. Then I asked Terrence to help me check the road surveillance, and finally found out that you came to the cemetery," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A hint of apology flashed in his eyes, "I'm sorry for making you go through all that trouble."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, next time you can't just turn off your phone like that!" she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I won't do it again in the future," he replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, his phone rang and he glanced at the caller ID, slightly furrowing his brows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Dad, what's up?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other end of the phone, Philip said, "Are you okay?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you find out?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're my son, of course I would know about your situation," Philip replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the father and son didn't explicitly mention what the specific situation was, they both understood what they were referring to.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want me to help?" Philip offered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I can handle it myself." If he couldn't handle even this, how could he take over the Barlow family's business in the future?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His identity couldn't change, and the fact that Lily was his mother couldn't change either.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he wanted to take charge of the Barlow family's enterprise in the future, he would only face more scrutiny!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, then you handle it yourself, but don't forget, the Barlow family is your support!" Philip said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's nose tingled slightly, "I know!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was grateful that Philip was his father. Although there weren't many intimate gestures between them, he knew that his father and the Barlow family were truly good to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After ending the call, he looked up and saw Jasper's bright eyes looking at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When you were on the phone with Uncle Barlow, it seemed like you were about to cry," she said, "Your nose is a bit red."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're mistaken," he said, feeling uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She rested her chin on her hand and said, "If you really want to cry, you can cry on my shoulder. My shoulder will always be there for you."</span></p></div>
