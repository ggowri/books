        <h1>Chapter 2548</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As I said, I have no regrets. I survived because of Herman. I managed to survive the mental hospital because I kept thinking about how Herman wanted me to stay alive and well before he died. Otherwise, I would&rsquo;ve killed myself long ago," said Amber Mitchell as the sun shone on her face. Her eyes were calm as if she had gone through all the ups and downs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gently looked down at the memorial tablet she was holding. "I think I&rsquo;ll cherish every day of my life more after I marry Herman. He wanted me to live well, so I&rsquo;ll try my best to live well. After I pass away, I can tell him I didn't waste the life he gave me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss looked at the woman in front of him and muttered, "Brother loved you so much that he might not want you to sacrifice the rest of your life on him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;ll explain it to him when the time comes. I&rsquo;ll tell him that this was what I wanted," said Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She wanted so much... to be his bride!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she could do was to be with Herman... in this way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory got a call from the hospital and went there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The hospital only said on the phone that they had something important to inform him, but George Gregory only saw the attending doctor and another unfamiliar doctor when he got there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Gregory, this is the doctor from the hospital's hematology department. Dr. Larson is responsible for Simon's blood test," the attending doctor introduced.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are there any new changes with Simon's condition?" George Gregory asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The attending doctor looked hesitantly at Dr. Larson beside him. Finally, Dr. Larson said, "Here's the thing, Simon's second blood transfusion had better effects than the third blood transfusion with his mother's blood. We thought that the situation was abnormal, so we compared Simon mother's blood with the blood of the four donors. We found something strange."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Something strange?" George Gregory narrowed his eyes. "What's strange?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Larson said, "Simon was very receptive to Amber Mitchell's blood, who&rsquo;s one of the four blood donors. Hence, I boldly conducted a DNA test. I only wanted to do a genetic comparison to see if any hidden factors might have led to the high acceptability rate, but it turns out that Amber Mitchell and Simon's genes show that they are... mother and son."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" George Gregory froze, hardly believing his ears. "What did you say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"According to the test results, Simon is Amber Mitchell's child. We also conducted a DNA test on Simon and Louise Mitchell. We found that they&rsquo;re a partial match, but they're not mother and son," said Dr. Larson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory was stunned. 'Simon is... Amber Mitchell's child! How could it be? When Simon was born, the Gregory family did a DNA test to prove that Simon is indeed my child.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he naturally thought that Simon was his and Louise Mitchell's child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the doctors were telling him that Simon was his and Amber Mitchell's child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell never had a child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly remembered that he had asked Amber Mitchell whether they had a child and she said... no!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But what if... Amber Mitchell was pregnant with my child back then?' With that in mind, George Gregory felt cold sweat pouring down his back!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What on earth is the truth? What the hell is going on here?'</p></div>
