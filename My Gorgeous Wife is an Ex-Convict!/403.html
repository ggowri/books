        <h1>Chapter 402</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, another man wanted her to tie his tie. How long would she be with him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not know. Even though they liked each other now and he did not care that she could not bear children, she did not dare to think about their future together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The difference between them was so big. Even if they were dating now, could they have a future together?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter?" His voice broke her trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. Bend&hellip; Bend down," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a bit difficult because of their height difference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He bent down obediently, bringing their faces closer together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gently raised his collar, then slipped the tie around his neck and began to tie it for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You know what? I'm putting my life in your hands right now." Jason's voice rang softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's fingers paused suddenly, her almond-shaped eyes fixed on the face close to hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to kill me now, just pull the tie." He smiled gently. It was charming and elegant. "The only woman who can tie my tie is you. No one else."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace reached the small restaurant, she still had Jason's smile in her mind, as well as his words... No one else... could ever tie his tie&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It did not matter whether his words would come true in the future, but at least for now, he was serious about her. Unlike her, who dared not think of their future, he... had probably thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At half-past one in the afternoon, the restaurant received an order of 20 sets of fast food. It was a little far from the small restaurant. It would take about 40 minutes to get there and back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace went out for the delivery, she found out that there was a shooting there and it was the staff who ordered the 20 sets of fast food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the film crew's break right now. Many people were either standing or squatting or sitting on some small stools to eat their lunch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, most of these people were extras or some ordinary crew members. The main cast would get better treatment&mdash;they had a separate room to rest in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace put down the order and was about to leave when one of them stopped her. "Hey, why is there a bug in this lunchbox!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a closer look and sure enough, an unknown bug was lying in the lunch box. She immediately frowned. It looked like he had not started eating it yet. He only just opened the lid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had entered the kitchen earlier and saw the chef packing each meal. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Each lunchbox was packed in a separate plastic bag. It would be impossible for a bug to fly into it on her way here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In that case, it was highly likely that...</p></div>
