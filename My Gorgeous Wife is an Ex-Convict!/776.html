        <h1>Chapter 775</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Dr. Leng's sudden disturbance was a surprise, and the most troublesome thing was that Miss Cummins had seen it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I'm afraid Young Master Reed won't let me off the hook so easily after this!' Terrence shuddered involuntarily at the thought, then glanced back at the psychiatrist who had become silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Did Dr. Leng suddenly create such a disturbance at Reed Residence because she&rsquo;s anxious? Anxious to prove she didn&rsquo;t hypnotize Grace for fear of losing her job?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Isn't that a bit too simplistic? I've only arranged for her to go abroad for a meeting and a vacation.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The look in Terrence's eyes changed as he thought of it. After all, being around Jason, he had seen so much that it was natural to understand one thing&mdash;there must be something wrong if things were going wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Maybe I need to do some more digging.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Reed Residence, Jason said to Grace with a smile, "Come on. Let's have breakfast first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, what was that all about?" Instead of following him to the dining room, she stood where she was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just like what you saw, one of the doctors you've seen came here and created a disturbance." He smiled as if he was saying an understatement. "I'll get you a good doctor and see what's the matter with your headache."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He once again tried to take her hand before walking toward the dining room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her steps remained still.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know Dr. Leng? Do you know I went to see her about hypnosis?" she took a deep breath and asked her innermost doubts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The smile on his face faded to the corners of his mouth. "It's your birthday today. Do you have to ask that now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, I want to know what's going on!" she said. Her mind was racing as there were a lot of things related to her that she had no idea about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you think it's better not to know?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Something seemed to flash through her mind suddenly. She immediately widened her eyes and looked at him, saying, "When I went to the hospital the other day, the nurse said Dr. Leng had to go abroad suddenly. Was it you... who did that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really want to know?" His eyelashes quivered a little. "What if I say yes? What are you going to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But why do you want..." She stopped short in the middle of her sentence, only feeling that the little silver bracelet in her hand had suddenly become heavy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was intelligent, and even if many things were not clear at first, they were now connected in her mind. She could more or less make a general guess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you... take this bracelet from my grandmother's mementos before handing them to me?" She held out her hand slowly. In the palm of her right hand lay a silver bracelet that had oxidized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glanced faintly at the bracelet, a complicated glance passing through his eyes. 'Are some things really impossible to avoid? I deliberately tried to sever all ties between her and Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, as if unconsciously, the severed ties are still connected.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like this silver bracelet that would eventually return to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What about the ties between her and Brian? Will they reconnect?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His thin lips whispered these words, "You're right. I did hide the bracelet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart sank immediately. His words seemed to confirm her suspicions further. "Do you also know about my amnesia?"</p></div>
