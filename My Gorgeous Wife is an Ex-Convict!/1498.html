        <h1>Chapter 1496</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Old Master Reed was wrong. Master Reed was willing to risk his life for Grace!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason could see the countdown timer when he reached the device. There were only eight minutes left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "Jay, no! Let's think of another way. Old Master Reed wouldn&rsquo;t have bet on something this simple! Didn&rsquo;t Old Master Reed care about the Reed family the most? If you&rsquo;re gone, the Reed family will be destroyed too! Old Master Reed wouldn&rsquo;t allow that to happen!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, don't be afraid. I said I would save you!" Jason said and pressed the green button.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Instantly, Old Master Reed's voice rang out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jason, my... Ahem, Ahem... My grandson. It seems that you're going to save Grace with your life. But you'll realize that this woman isn't worth saving at all! To deactivate the bombs, you need to use your thumbprint to do it and once you have your thumbprint on it, you have to hold it down until it's time for the bombs to go off. But at the same time, the device will explode and you&rsquo;ll be killed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master Reed's voice drifted into the air and made everyone who heard it feel a chill rising in their hearts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The man who was once the most powerful figure in Emerald City was being cold-blooded to his grandson after his death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"However, you can walk away at any time between pressing the disarm button with your thumb. But if the disarm fails, the bombs on the other side will go off. Why don't we see how much... Ahem, ahem... See how much you love this woman and... whether this woman is worth your life..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Old Master's recording ended here, and there was only silence left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could only feel her body trembling. How could Old Master... be so cruel to his grandson?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Why... Why?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Does Jason have to die to save me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, don't press it. Let's think of something else!" shouted Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence had also rushed to Jason's side. "Master Reed, don't be impulsive."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm calm!" said Jason, looking at Grace in the car about 20 meters away. "Grace, put your foot on the gas pedal. Just press on the gas pedal and rush forward once the place explodes, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace sobbed. "Jay, listen to me. I don't want you to save me this way. There must be another way!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"There may be other ways, but it's too late now," said Jason. The clock was ticking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">There were only three minutes left. They could not do a lot in three minutes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason crouched down and pressed his thumb on the device, which showed that he was ready to risk his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace opened her mouth to ask Jason to leave, but all the words seemed stuck in her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though he was crouching, his eyes were still looking at her as if he wanted to imprint every inch of her into his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, she knew that he had made up his mind. He was determined to trade his life for hers!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He would not leave no matter how much she convinced him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace, I'm sorry I put you through so much pain and dragged you into this danger. You don't have to feel guilty about anything. Just take it as compensation for what I did to you. It doesn't matter whether you forgive me anymore." He just wanted her to live.</p></div>
