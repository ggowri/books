        <h1>Chapter 3978</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day, when Nancy woke up, she was in her rented room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her head was still throbbing, reminding her of her drunkenness from yesterday!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>By the way, how did she get back to the rental room? She clearly remembered seeing Mick, and then... Nancy held her head in her hand, thinking about the last scene in her mind from last night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She... remembered that she seemed to have said a lot to Mick, and then... she had no more impression.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Mick send her back? She looked around the room, but didn't see the figure she wanted to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Immediately, Nancy smiled bitterly. What was she thinking?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she really expect Mick to be here?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Presumably, after she passed out drunk yesterday, someone sent her back!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he probably felt sick just staying with her for one more second.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Nancy returned to the hotel to work in the morning, her boss called her to the office and asked again about what happened in the VIP room yesterday.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After explaining, Nancy finally said, "Manager, I want to resign. I hope you can approve it. I will submit my resignation letter later!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Resign?" The manager was stunned, "Is it because of the shock you received yesterday?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah." She knew the manager had misunderstood, but for now, it was a good excuse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to resign just because she promised Mick that she wouldn't appear in front of him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This hotel is a high-end hotel in Emerald City, so there is a possibility of encountering Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Therefore, resigning is the best solution.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The situation last night was not common, and our hotel will take better measures in this regard in the future," the supervisor said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Nancy is capable and a good subordinate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I still want to resign and find a job that I can adapt to better," Nancy said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Nancy's firm attitude, the supervisor did not try to persuade her and only asked her to do a good job of handover.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Nancy left the supervisor's office, she saw Irene coming towards her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Irene glared at Nancy fiercely, "I didn't expect you to be a sneaky eavesdropper. I warn you, no matter how much you heard from my conversation with Mick yesterday, you are not allowed to say a word to anyone, or you will regret it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sneaky eavesdropper?" Nancy looked at Irene coldly. "If we are talking about sneaky behavior, who is more sneaky between eavesdropping and planting a bug?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch!" Irene raised her hand to hit Nancy, but was intercepted by her in mid-air.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Irene, if you really like someone and want to win their heart, you should think about how to make them like you instead of using despicable means to destroy and suppress others!" Nancy warned. "Even if Mick doesn't like me anymore, do you really think he will like you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This made Irene even more angry. "You don't understand. If it weren't for you, Mick would have fallen for me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She chose to work in this hotel in order to create opportunities to reunite with Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her plan was ruined by Nancy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick was already interested in Nancy, and she could only choose to lurk in the shadows, waiting to catch Nancy's mistake and completely crush her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy snorted, "You really are beyond help! You're the one who doesn't understand emotions!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You--"</span></p></div>
