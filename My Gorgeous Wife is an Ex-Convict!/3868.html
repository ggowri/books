        <h1>Chapter 3866</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper looked at Lawrence and said, "I know you're leaving, so I came to say goodbye."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Goodbye?" He chuckled and suddenly bent down, their faces were suddenly very close.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper slightly frowned, while there was a gasp around them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's obvious that Lawrence's actions now make it seem ambiguous between him and Jasper to outsiders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I thought there wouldn't be any goodbyes between us. Last time you left, you looked at me with disgust," Lawrence said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper replied, "Because I wanted to completely untangle my own emotions."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Emotions?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, you are my emotional baggage," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes flickered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Can you go somewhere with me?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's nothing I can't do. Consider it fulfilling your last wish," he shrugged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She turned around and walked ahead, with Lawrence following behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them left the campus and Jasper brought Lawrence to a building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper said to the driver who followed them, "Just wait downstairs."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..." The driver hesitated, as he was responsible for Jasper's safety.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are surveillance cameras everywhere in the building. He won't do anything to me. Otherwise, he can't leave Emerald City if something happens to me," Jasper said, not only to the driver but also to Lawrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence was a smart person and wouldn't do anything that could put him in danger before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The driver didn't say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence glanced at Jasper thoughtfully, clearly understanding his meaning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence also knew that this building was a gathering place for some well-known musicians, and many famous music studios were located here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper took Lawrence to the 7th floor and used his fingerprint to open one of the doors. Inside was a space of about 500 square meters, arranged like a typical music studio, with the most special feature being a piano placed in the center.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Lawrence approached the piano, suddenly a memory came to mind--</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Lawrence, do you want to be a pianist in the future?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, but...I don't have a piano."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then I'll give you a very, very good piano in the future, so you can play even more beautiful music. You will definitely become a famous pianist."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if...I don't become a pianist?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's okay, I just love your piano playing, I really really love it. I want to be able to hear your piano playing often in the future, and play our favorite songs together."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in the end, she didn't often hear his piano playing, nor did they play their favorite songs together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I bought this piano when I was 14 years old at an auction," Jasper said. "When I saw and heard this piano, I thought it was perfect for you, so I asked my dad to buy it for me." Jasper said, "I thought that when I found you in the future, I would definitely give this piano to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm sure this piano is very valuable, but I don't really need a piano right now," Lawrence said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Yes, it was indeed very valuable, worth 50 million, and even many of the world's famous pianos couldn't fetch that price.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But at the time, she just wanted to get this piano for him, so she asked her dad to help her get it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So even if it's 50 million, her father has fulfilled her wish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Later on, she unconsciously turned this piano into a way to express her feelings for him.</p></div>
