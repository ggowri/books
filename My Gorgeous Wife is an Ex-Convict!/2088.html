        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay." Kyla smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After her son went to bed, she suddenly felt hungry, so she cooked a packet of instant noodles to eat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, that nausea came back again after only a few mouthfuls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She immediately rushed to the kitchen sink and threw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Blaargh... Blaargh..." She kept vomiting. Though she tried desperately to suppress the feeling, it only became more and more intense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Finally, she stopped when she almost collapsed from throwing up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla trembled as she gargled and washed the sink clean. Finally, she sat down in a chair with the soggy instant noodles in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her hand slowly touched her belly. She vaguely knew the answer, but she did not want to admit it nor face it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If she was pregnant, what was she going to do? What would happen to her relationship with Martin Weiss?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No, it won't be that coincidental. It was just one time. How is that possible..." she murmured. She wanted to deny it, but tears were already running down her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was sleepless that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the following days, Kyla's morning sickness continued. Mrs. Corbyn even caught her vomiting a few times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What's come over you? Are you having an upset stomach? Why don't I get some medicine for your stomach?" asked Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks. I... I'll go to the hospital this afternoon," said Kyla, looking a little pale. No matter how she denied it, her frequent vomiting reminded her of the reality she did not want to face the most.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the afternoon, Kyla came to the hospital and registered to see a gynecologist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She only needed to do a blood test to find out whether she was pregnant. It would only take half an hour!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when she saw the numbers on the blood test, Kyla felt like she was struck by lightning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Pregnant! Am I really pregnant?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I got pregnant again... from that one time!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She tried to distance herself from him, but reality slapped her hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The gynecologist looked through her blood test results and said, "You're pregnant. When was your last period?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla gave them a date.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The doctor said, "You're four weeks pregnant. Come back the next day for a blood test to see if the numbers double."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla walked out of the hospital in silence. 'Pregnant... I'm really pregnant. What should I do... with the baby?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Having an abortion would be the most sensible thing to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Abort the child and act as if nothing ever happened. Martin Weiss and I would proceed our lives with the way it&rsquo;s supposed to be.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'That's what I want, right?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But... that's human life! The baby is growing in my womb now. Am I willing to abort them?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she was unjustly imprisoned, she was reluctant to abort Nelson even under such difficult circumstances. She was willing to give up her life to give birth to Nelson, let alone now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Things were so much better now. Giving birth to the baby would not be as difficult as it was back then.</p></div>
