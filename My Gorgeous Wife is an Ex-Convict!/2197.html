        <h1>Chapter 2195</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin Stephenson should be able to find out who did it." Grace's eyes fell on Kyla's belly. "You're pregnant, and running a store is hard. Why don't I find someone to help you out? You can take over the store again when your body recovers after you give birth to your baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"No thanks, I'm doing okay. And I recently stopped having morning sickness. The baby's rather obedient and doesn't give me much trouble. My mom can still help me out. If we face any trouble, I&rsquo;ll definitely ask for your help. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla said with a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All Grace could say was, "Call me if you need anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Okay," answered Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After leaving Kyla's place, Grace went to see Lina. She wanted to ask whether they had found any clues regarding the poison injection. However, she was shocked when she reached Lina and Hadwin Stephenson's mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What... What is he doing here?" Grace looked in shock at the little boy sitting on the couch while holding Tina Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was the little boy from the mysterious Hunter family. They had put in a lot of effort trying to find him but it was to no avail. They eventually had to use fake news to lure the child out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After the incident at the hospital where the child made a deal to marry Tina when she came of age, Grace thought she would only meet the child again in about 20 years. Unexpectedly, the child appeared again so soon, and he appeared in Lina's mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"He was here the other day. This is his second visit," said Lina. Just then, the maid had already prepared the milk. The little boy took it and fed Tina Stephenson naturally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze a little. 'Does this kid... come here a lot?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Do the grown-ups in your family know you're here?" Grace could not help asking the little boy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes. They said I need to come over to bond with my future bride since I've chosen one. That's why I'm here," the boy said solemnly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace almost choked. 'A seven or eight-year-old child is bonding with a baby who was born less than a month ago?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it seemed that there was nothing wrong with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why do you want to marry Tina?" Grace asked in confusion. After all, she thought that such a young child might not know much about love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Because I want to be with Tina forever. But my mother-in-law says we can only be together forever if we get married," the little boy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The word &lsquo;mother-in-law&rsquo; made Grace choke again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina immediately said, "Hey, didn't I tell you not to call me your mother-in-law? It makes me feel old. You can call me Aunt Lina first. You can call me your mother-in-law once you and Tina get married!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Lina also gave the little boy a &lsquo;kind and friendly&rsquo; smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You still look old even if I call you Aunt Lina," the little boy said rudely</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's expression crumbled. 'What a snarky future son-in-law.' All she was satisfied with this son-in-law was his good looks and how well he treated her daughter. He was so nice that he was like a nanny.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Call me Aunt! Do you hear me?" The words were almost squeezed out of Lina's teeth, and the &lsquo;kind and friendly&rsquo; smile became &lsquo;hideous&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy was smart. After considering it, he finally called out for the baby's sake, "Aunt Lina."</p></div>
