        <h1>Chapter 1579</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He calmly said those cruel and vicious words as though they were small matters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said, "No, you don't have to do all that. You just have to make her understand that you're mine. That's all. Don't give her any hope. If she has any other ideas and steps out of line, I'll deal with her myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No matter what, she would not share her husband with another!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason raised his eyebrows slightly. "I'm yours?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace&rsquo;s cheeks started blushing again but she did not avoid Jason's eyes. She said earnestly, "Yeah, you're mine. You're my husband."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A touch of tenderness flickered through Jason's eyes, but he did not notice it himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was so used to being in control that he would have hated it if someone else had said it, but he felt pleased and satisfied when she said it. He did not know how to describe it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Are you so sure that I'm yours? Aren't you afraid of me falling in love with another woman?" he asked as his thin lips tugged into a smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace bit her lip slightly. After pondering for a moment, she said earnestly, "I'll try to fight for you, but if you really love her to the point where you can&rsquo;t give her up, then I'll leave without kicking up a fuss.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he really fell in love with someone else one day, then he was not the Jay she loved anymore. In that case, they might as well set each other free.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jason's expression immediately changed when she said this. He instantly pulled her into his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The satisfaction and joy he felt earlier turned into fear because of what she just said. He was so afraid that his body trembled slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What's wrong with me... I'm determined to fall in love with this woman, but... It turns out she has more influence over me than I imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&lsquo;Can anything she says or does affect me so much?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who permitted you to leave? Now that you've returned to the Reed family, then stay in the Reed family forever!" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's hug was so tight that she could hardly breathe. Besides, his body seemed to be shaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, what's come over you?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Did you hear what I said? You can never leave," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was surprised. 'Is it because of what I just said about leaving?' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I was just speaking metaphorically. If that ever happens&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"That will never happen!" he interrupted and stared down at her, saying, " So you can forget about leaving."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His eyes seemed to want to swallow her up. Grace stared blankly at the man in front of her. Looking at his delicate and handsome face, she watched him slowly approach her. Her eyelashes quivered as she watched him. Then, she slowly closed her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was kissing her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The kiss was lingering and overbearing. His fingers firmly clasped the back of her head as if she was not allowed to struggle and escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace..." His enamored voice melted into the kiss.</p></div>
