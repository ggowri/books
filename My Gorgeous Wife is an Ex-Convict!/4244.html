        <h1>Chapter 4242 How Do You Want It</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina glanced at Kit and after a while, she said, "Alright, I understand."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Kit smiled and slowly let go of her hand.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After Tina left, Kit sat weakly on the sofa, his normal left hand supporting his forehead. He laughed bitterly, "Haha... haha..."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As tears welled up, he tasted the salty flavor.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Whether it was before Tina's amnesia or after, he always showed her his vulnerable side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If only she could see his good side.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He wished she could only remember him as someone wonderful.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So it's better not to see each other anymore! Even though he really wants to see her, it's still better not to see each other anymore. Maybe that's for the best!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina left Kit's place and went to Chandler's place.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler was flipping through a book in the living room of the villa. When he saw Tina, he immediately put down the book and walked up to her. "What's wrong? Did something happen?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at the man in front of her, his face clearly showing concern. "Do you think something's wrong with me?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can sense that you're unhappy. If there's any trouble, you can tell me and I'll help you solve it," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina didn't expect him to be able to see through her unhappiness. She thought she was hiding her emotions well.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it because he used to know her so well?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I went to see Kit today," Tina didn't hide anything and told him the truth.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler was taken aback, seeming a bit surprised. "So, did something unhappy happen when you saw Kit?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want to know why I went to see him?" she asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You have your reasons for seeing him. You've never liked others asking you too many questions," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina suddenly felt like she was being seen through by the person in front of her. He understood her very well, but the amnesiac her didn't understand him at all!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I saw a post online and learned that his hand is disabled, so I went to find him." Although it was true that she didn't like others probing her or explaining herself.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at this moment, she wanted to make it clear.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she afraid that he would misunderstand?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina herself couldn't explain this feeling.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And then?" Chandler asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"His hand really can't move, and I also met his father and heard some unpleasant conversations," Tina sighed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to help him?" Chandler asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She smiled bitterly, "He refused and hopes that we won't meet again in the future."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at Tina, "So you're unhappy because he doesn't want your help?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina took a deep breath, "Because of his deception, I used to hate and resent him. In the end, I told myself not to think about it, but after knowing that his hand is disabled, I couldn't help but go see him again. During the car accident, he protected me and Quinn. His hand became disabled, maybe it's because he protected me during the accident. In my heart, I feel like I owe him."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This conflicting and complicated emotion enveloped her, leaving her at a loss.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So what do you want to do?" Chandler's voice sounded gentle once again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked blankly at the person in front of her as if no matter what she said, he would help her, he would stand by her side!</span></p></div>
