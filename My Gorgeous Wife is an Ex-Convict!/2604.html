        <h1>Chapter 2602</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" He suddenly got up and released her hand. Then, he lifted his hands and removed his white shirt in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately caught sight of the hideous scar again. It was a clearer view than earlier. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked blankly at his injury while feeling the urge to cry. She was already tearing up. "Does the wound still hurt?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's been more than two months. Does it hurt for you?" he asked indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was not in pain, so he must be fine. "I'm sorry I made you suffer so much for me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said coldly, "I didn't do it for you but to fulfill my wishes before the hypnosis. Now that you've seen the wound, don&rsquo;t take off my clothes randomly anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said as he bent down, and their cheeks were so close together. His fingers grabbed her jaw, and he brushed the tip of his thumb against her lips. "Believe me. I have no interest in you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he turned around and left the yard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at Martin Weiss's leaving figure. Her wrist still held the lingering heat from when he grabbed her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">From his speech and body movements, he was distancing himself from her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had agreed to the three-month bet, but... he was reluctant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A waste of time? Three months? Is it really a waste of time?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a nearby corner, Shana Nicholls looked at Kyla with anger. She did not expect to see such a scene when she had only left to get a thin blanket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was in a position where she could not hear what they said, but... the way Mr. Weiss looked at the woman was different from his usual indifference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if there was something hidden deep under his eyes, or rather... he was suppressing something!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What was Mr. Weiss suppressing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, whatever it was, Mr. Weiss was probably not indifferent to Mrs. Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace and Lina were visiting Mrs. Corbyn at the store when they happened to meet Amber Mitchell, who came to visit. After leaving the store, the three of them found a nearby restaurant and sat down to dine together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Lina was meeting Amber Mitchell for the first time, she had learned about Amber Mitchell from Grace and Kyla. Hence, she had always admired Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it took an extraordinary amount of fortitude for a woman to survive that kind of adversity without committing suicide or being driven insane.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, Amber Mitchell. My name is Lina. I often heard Grace and Kyla mention you, so I don't find you unfamiliar. Instead, I have a sense of familiarity upon seeing you.&rdquo; Lina had always been outgoing and straightforward, so she was friendly with Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell laughed. "Hello, I've heard about you from Kyla too. We could finally meet each other today. Since we&rsquo;re all in Emerald City, we can visit each other more often when we have time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to live in Emerald City permanently?" Lina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell nodded. "Yes, I'm currently studying at an archaeological research institute in Emerald City. I&rsquo;m hoping to lead a more fulfilling life."</p></div>
