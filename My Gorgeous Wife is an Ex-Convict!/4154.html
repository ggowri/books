        <h1>Chapter 4152 Unexpected Happening</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Alright, I understand," Kit said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Edmond was taken aback. "What do you understand?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I understand that even if I become poor and a washed-up star in the future, I won't spend a single cent of my father's money. So, father, you can rest assured. Even if my future is difficult, I won't burden you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You&mdash;" Edmond was so angry that he trembled all over. He lifted his foot and kicked Kit in the stomach.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit groaned in pain, clutching his stomach, and stumbled to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Boy, let me tell you, you're not yet strong enough! I'll pretend I didn't hear what you said today, but remember to please Miss Stephenson in the future. Otherwise, go and please Mr. Perkins for me again!" After saying this, Edmond left without looking back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Kit scrambled to his feet from the ground and pulled out the amulet from his pocket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Staring blankly at the amulet, he let out a bitter smile and pressed it against his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> How much longer would it take for him to break free from his father? To truly live?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If Tina knew that her idol lived like this, would she be even more disappointed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Every time he got closer to her, the harsh reality only made him feel more inferior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> And this sense of inferiority deepened over time...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> ----</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina arrived at Chandler's company, which surprised him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It wasn't her sudden arrival without any greetings that surprised him, but her obvious low spirits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What's wrong? What happened?" he asked as he approached her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina suddenly hugged Chandler tightly, burying her face in his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Huh?" Chandler looked down at the person in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Let me stay like this for a while," she whispered softly. The uncomfortable feelings caused by Kit seemed to gradually calm down only when she held Chandler like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> It had become an unconscious habit over the years. It was as if he had become her emotional stabilizer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just then, the office door was forcefully pushed open and someone barged in. "Mr. Hunter, there's an incident at the Downtown factory..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> However, upon seeing the two embracing each other, the person immediately closed their mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler furrowed his brow but didn't push Tina away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Instead, Tina felt a bit embarrassed and voluntarily released her hold, no longer clinging to him in front of his subordinates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Why didn't you knock?" Chandler said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I was in a hurry and forgot," the subordinate said. "There's been a fire accident at the Downtown factory. The fire truck has already been dispatched, but the situation is still unclear."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's expression changed. "How bad is the fire?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Not optimistic."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Just those four words made Chandler realize that this fire incident was no small matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I need to rush to the Downtown factory now," Chandler turned to Tina and said, "I'm sorry, I can't accompany you. After I handle the fire situation, I'll come back tonight and hear what happened, alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'll go with you!" Tina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "No, it's not possible. There's a fire happening over there, and in case of any sudden emergencies..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "But won't you also encounter unexpected situations? Regardless, I want to go with you," Tina said. "Just like how you worry about me, I also worry about you!"</p></div>
