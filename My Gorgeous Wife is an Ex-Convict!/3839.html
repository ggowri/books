        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as she hesitated, Lawrence suddenly added, "By the way, if you have any electronic devices on you, they will malfunction once you enter here. This is to prevent anyone from stealing data from the lab."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was taken aback and asked, "Are you worried that I will record our conversation?" Lawrence just smiled and said nothing. Jasper suddenly realized why Lawrence insisted on having this conversation in the lab, and she had a feeling of what he might ask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper pursed her lips and said, "I didn't record anything." Lawrence asked, "So what do you want to ask me?" Jasper asked, "What is your relationship with Daniel?" Lawrence replied, "We've met twice, but we're not close. As you know, we don't have a good impression of the Reed family, so when we meet, we naturally chat for a few words."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper then asked, "Do you know about Daniel's plan to retaliate against Mason and Veronica?" Lawrence smiled slightly and said, "Yes, I know. Doesn't your family know about it? He wants to retaliate against Mason and Veronica, and he has been thinking about it for a long time. After all, he thinks that his current miserable life is all because of the Reed family! Having money and power is great, you can easily manipulate other people's lives!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper denied it and said, "No! The Reed family has never done such a thing! It wasn't Mason who made Daniel's father embezzle, nor was it Mason who made Daniel's mother sick. All Mason did was give some money to make Daniel and Veronica break up!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lawrence sarcastically asked, "Doesn't that count as manipulating other people's lives?" Jasper replied, "But that was Daniel's own choice!" Lawrence hinted, "Yes, it was his own choice, so this time, he will retaliate against Mason and Veronica, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper stared at Lawrence and suddenly asked directly, "Does Daniel's actions this time have anything to do with you? Did you instruct or suggest anything to him?" She didn't want to beat around the bush anymore and asked directly what she wanted to know.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And what about you? What kind of answer do you want to hear?" Lawrence asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just want to hear the truth," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I did say a few things to Daniel, but whether or not he took them seriously and acted </span><span>on them was his own choice," Lawrence said, admitting to his involvement while also distancing himself from it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But this statement also made Jasper understand that Daniel's confession, although partly motivated by a desire to clear his own name, was also partly true - Lawrence really was involved in this matter.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although all Lawrence did was talk and say a few things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But sometimes, words can be the most persuasive and can lead to the worst outcomes!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why? Why would you do this? Even if you hate me, hate that my parents didn't help your family back then, Mason and Veronica have nothing to do with it! They have no grudges against you!" Jasper stared at Lawrence and asked loudly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But they can hurt you, can't they?" Lawrence said coldly, "You can only blame Mason for being your brother and Veronica for being the person your brother loves."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper felt like she was in an ice cave. "Just because of that, you want to kill two innocent people?"</span></p></div>
