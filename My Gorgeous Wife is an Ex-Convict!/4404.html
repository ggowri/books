        <h1>Chapter 4402: She is His Hero</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could she be here? Calvert was taken aback, and then he remembered what had happened before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Oh right, he was tricked by his agent into having dinner with Miss Maldonado. They drugged him, and just when he was in despair, thinking something terrible was about to happen, Harley showed up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was like a hero fallen from the sky, saving him from his predicament.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he was a child, he always hoped that a hero would come and pull him out of his messy life. He wanted to be like other children, to have a warm home, to be loved, and to live a life where he could eat well, dress warmly, and not be beaten every day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he grew older, he gradually understood that heroes only exist in fairy tales. So, he stopped harboring such unrealistic expectations.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But then she came into his life, changing his destiny and leading him to live a life he never dared to dream of before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, she had even saved him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he possibly not be moved by someone like this!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He lifted his hand, unable to resist the urge to touch that peacefully sleeping face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as his hand was about to touch her face, her eyelashes fluttered, and a pair of beautiful eyes opened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert quickly pulled back his hand, instantly snapping back to reality.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What on earth is he doing?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He has no right to do such a thing, it's like he's desecrating her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're awake, how are you feeling?" Harley asked Calvert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's... there's nothing else, really. Thank you so much this time," Calvert said, his face flushing slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What you've been through, your agent can't just get away with it, it's outrageous!" Harley said, "I'll deal with this kind of agent for you, and later find you a suitable one."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He watched her, filled with righteous indignation, and felt a warm feeling in his heart, "Mm-hmm."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're feeling okay, you can be discharged this morning. I'll sort out your discharge paperwork in a bit," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can handle the discharge procedures </span><span>myself,</span><span> I've already troubled you enough!" he said hastily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't talk about whether it's a hassle or not, aren't we friends?" Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Friend..." Calvert's eyes dimmed a bit. Yes, they were just friends. Even being able to be her friend was already a great fortune. How could he dare to fantasize about anything more?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley handled the discharge procedures for Calvert and accompanied him back to his residence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, these past few days, the doctor has been advising you to drink more water to speed up your metabolism and flush out the residual medication in your body. Also... um, they said your body might react more easily, but don't panic, it's all normal. Once all the residual medication in your body is metabolized, you'll be fine."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After hearing this, Calvert's face suddenly turned beet red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, my body tensed up. What was once a normal body, had suddenly become somewhat sensitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You..." Harley looked at Calvert's rosy cheeks, finding them incredibly beautiful, and suddenly had the urge to tease him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What's the matter? We're all adults here, there's nothing to be shy about!" she said, "You can't possibly tell me you don't even know how to relieve stress on your own."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as these words were spoken, Calvert's face turned even redder, "I... I just... just..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just "only" pondered for half a day, but couldn't come up with what to say next.</span></p></div>
