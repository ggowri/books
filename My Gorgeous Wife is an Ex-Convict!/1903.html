        <h1>Chapter 1901</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence quickly stated, "No, I wouldn't dare! I just hope you can understand the truth and not misunderstand Young Madam. Her feelings for you are true, and she probably did it on the spur of the moment."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If her feelings for me were true and she was willing to give up her life for me, then why would she betray me for someone else? Is my mother, who abandoned her husband and son, more important than her life?" Jason asked with a sneer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence immediately shut up, knowing that Young master Reed would get mad again if he continued!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Jason almost finished the work at hand, there was finally a knock on the study&rsquo;s door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Terrence let out a sigh of relief, thinking it must be Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Sure enough, when the door was pushed open, Grace walked in and sat down on the couch. She was quiet and did not disturb them, just like the previous days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason glanced at Grace out of the corners of his eyes. His restless heart seemed to have suddenly calmed down because of her appearance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">After telling Terrence some more things, Jason said, "That's all for today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Then I'm going home," said Terrence as he quickly left the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace got up and approached Jason. "Are you done with work?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"How long are you going to stay here?" Jason asked out of the blue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace said, "I'll stay here as long as you&rsquo;re here. Jay, the kids miss us. They want us to go home. Don't you miss them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace's nose felt a little sore at the mention of the kids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You're still the same. It's all about the kids. You only married me because you wanted to give the children a complete family, and now you want me to go home with you for the kids. What's the matter? Do you want to create a happy and blissful illusion for the kids that much?" Jason asked with his eyebrows raised slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace looked at Jason somewhat blankly. Suddenly, she took a deep breath, got up, and grabbed Jason's collar. "Is it true that you don't believe what I say anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He glanced at her, and though he said nothing, the expression on his face was one of acquiescence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It&rsquo;s true that part of the reason I married you was indeed to give our kids a complete family, but... the vows I made when we received our marriage license were sincere and contained no lies! What I told you about falling off the cliff and me loving you are true! They're true!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She blurted out a long string of words as if the emotions she had been repressing for days finally burst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Surprise flashed across Jason's eyes. He did not expect the person in front of him to speak so loudly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her wet eyes and that sonorous, powerful voice seemed to be expressing her grievances. "Jason, believe it or not, you'll never meet another woman who will love you more than I do!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, she suddenly released her grip, turned, and ran out of the study, leaving him alone. He sat in his chair and brushed his hand lightly against the collar of his shirt, which she had just grabbed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"So, are you trying to say you're the woman who loves me the most?" he muttered to himself.</p></div>
