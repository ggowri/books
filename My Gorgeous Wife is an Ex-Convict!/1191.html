        <h1>Chapter 1190</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was tired of watching Stella put on a show. What she said was enough to let her know that Chase Harper had been set up by her cousin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Why was her cousin setting Chase Harper up like this? They had nothing in common!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, one of the policemen said to Grace, "You must be the lawyer representing Chase Harper. You can go in and talk to Chase Harper now, but only for half an hour."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Grace answered quickly, but as she was about to walk forward, a hand suddenly grasped her wrist from behind her. "You're Chase Harper's lawyer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately turned her head and saw Brian's face. Surprise flashed across her face. She did not expect Brian... to have left the hospital and come to the police station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you leave the hospital? Did the doctor allow you to come here?" she asked. The gauze had been removed from his head and body yesterday, but he was supposed to stay in the hospital for at least a few more days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to represent Chase Harper?" he asked instead of replying to her question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He's my friend, and I believe he's innocent," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella, who was nearby, interrupted immediately, "Do you think I've wronged Chase Harper? He's an animal! If the passerby had come a little later, he would&rsquo;ve gotten away with it! Grace, even if he's your friend, couldn't he have done such a despicable thing? Why do you trust him so much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because I know sometimes the evidence doesn't tell the whole truth!" Grace answered unhesitatingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her affirmation made Brian frown. Just then, the police officer urged Grace. "Hurry up, don't waste our time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay! Right away!" answered Grace. She pulled her hand out of Brian's and sped into the interrogation room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at Grace until the door of the interrogation room was closed. He looked down at the hand he had just held her with as if thinking of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella's voice rang in his ears. "I didn't expect that Grace would rather believe in Chase Harper than me. Why would I start a rumor about a man raping me? Don't I have any shame? How could Grace do this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella sobbed repeatedly. She grabbed Brian's arm. &ldquo;Brian, you'll believe me and get me justice, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian turned his head and looked at Stella who was weeping in front of him. His voice deepened, and he said, "I'll help you get justice if you've really been wronged or hurt." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella sniffled. "I... I knew it. You're still the Bryn from our childhood, and you'll protect me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian pursed his thin lips, and his eyes seemed to darken. "I told you not to call me 'Bryn' anymore. It's just a childhood nickname." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body seemed to be instinctively repulsed to hear the woman in front of him call him &lsquo;Bryn&rsquo;. It was as if it would shatter something he held dear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A flash of embarrassment came across Stella's face, and she tried hard to suppress it. "Okay... Brian, I'm just going to call you Brian from now on. Thank you, Brian. Thank you for protecting me as you promised when you were a child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She deliberately mentioned &lsquo;their childhood&rsquo; many times to get him to take her side in this matter no matter what!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p></div>
