        <h1>Chapter 1407</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Grace...' Kyla Corbyn remembered that Grace had saved her by breaking into Paisley Daniels's ward at the height of her humiliation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Without Grace, she would have suffered more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, how did Grace rush in so coincidentally?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Kyla Corbyn expressed her doubts, Mrs. Corbyn said, "Nelson called Grace. Nelson had been crying after Martin Weiss's subordinate brought him home this morning. He asked me for my phone, saying he wanted to call Aunt Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn looked at her worried-looking son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">A four-year-old child showing such a worried expression made Kyla Corbyn's heart go into a fit of agony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Nelson, Mommy's okay. Look, I'm okay now, aren't I?" said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'm sorry. I didn't protect you properly!" The little one lowered his head gloomily. 'If I were an adult, I would&rsquo;ve been able to protect Mommy and she wouldn't be taken away like that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'I hope I can grow up quickly so I can protect Mommy from being bullied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why would Daddy bully Mommy? Why won't Daddy believe Mommy is a kind person?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You've protected me today. You called Aunt Grace and told her to find me. You did great," said Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Kyla Corbyn's praise did not make Nelson happy. The little one's young and tender face still had a solemn expression. "Mommy, I don't want Daddy anymore. All I want is you! I won't miss Daddy, ask for Daddy, and see Daddy anymore. I want to grow up quickly. I can protect you once I&rsquo;m all grown up!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn's eyes reddened. She would like to see him grow up if she could, but... "Okay. I'll wait for you to grow up and protect me, Nelson."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not long before Nelson started rubbing his eyes. He was obviously sleepy, but the little one refused to sleep in the escort bed next to her. He insisted on sleeping in the hospital bed with Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His little body was close to Kyla Corbyn, and his two little hands tugged at the hem of Kyla Corbyn's hospital clothes as he fell asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Corbyn asked, "Why on earth did Martin Weiss bring you away today? I asked Grace earlier and she didn't say anything."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn figured that Grace did not know how to tell the elderly and the child about what she had experienced at that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, telling them about it would only upset them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Kyla Corbyn smiled faintly and said, "It's all over. But Mom... I may not be able to entrust Nelson to Martin Weiss anymore. I thought he would have some fatherly affections for Nelson, but now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What Martin Weiss had said in front of Nelson only frightened her. She was afraid that Martin Weiss would not protect his son at all when Paisley Daniels wanted to get rid of Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Then we'll take Nelson away and hide from Martin Weiss. An old woman like me will bring Nelson up even if I have to beg for food!" said Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Her daughter was now lying on the hospital bed like this after she was taken away by Martin Weiss. It made Mrs. Corbyn hate Martin Weiss even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even though her husband had done the Weiss family wrong, Kyla had not done anything wrong!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I'll see what I can do about Nelson." Kyla Corbyn sighed. "Mom, I'm really sorry. You have to worry about me and can&rsquo;t enjoy life in your remaining years."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mrs. Corbyn wept. "There's nothing to apologize for. I just want you to be happy as long as you live. Let's live our lives happily. We have nothing to do with that b*stard Martin Weiss anymore."</p></div>
