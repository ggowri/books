        <h1>Chapter 3524</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice trailed off as he slowly turned his head, his gaze settling on her face. "But later on, I understood why."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In that instant, Veronica felt as though all the blood in her body was slowly freezing under his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In my ear, I could only hear his voice continuing to speak word by word, "Because I loved too much, I regarded the other person as more important than my own life. If that existence disappears, then my own life becomes irrelevant."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She struggled to swallow the sudden secretion of saliva in her throat. "But...what does this have to do with the misunderstanding between us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because I don't want to love you too much anymore. I don't want to end up with no hope and only despair," he said. "So, Veronica, this is where we end."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She felt a sudden shock. Was he going to completely distance himself from her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From now on, he was no longer her brother or family, but only Mason of the Reed family!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, a feeling of fear surged up from the bottom of her heart! This fear and discomfort even surpassed the feeling she had when she broke up with Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No! She didn't want this! If he thought she only saw him as a younger brother, then she could even...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took two steps forward, wanting to grab his hand. "What if I don't want this?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But his hand suddenly pulled back, leaving her hand empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What makes you think you have the right to want or not want anything now?" he retorted. "Veronica, not every time do you hold the initiative!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason!" she shouted, "Can you really just stop here so easily? Can you abandon all of our years of love and affection?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Those little moments they shared were what sustained their bond throughout the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this moment, Veronica tried to use their past emotions to dissolve the distance between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But his next words shattered all of her hopes. "I can."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He said it so plainly, and her eyes dimmed with sadness as she trembled, "You...can?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I can, because that long-standing affection you mentioned no longer exists for me now," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stared at him blankly, feeling like he was a stranger to her. "What do you mean by that?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know about hypnosis?" he asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her eyebrows furrowed, and she felt increasingly uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Once, my mother and father were separated. My father thought my mother was dead and he almost went crazy. At that time, Secretary Wylie, who took me away, had someone hypnotize my father to forget about my mother's existence. That way, my father didn't really go insane."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica doesn't understand why Mason suddenly brought this up. After all, he hasn't forgotten about her! He knows who she is and remembers what happened between them!</p></div>
