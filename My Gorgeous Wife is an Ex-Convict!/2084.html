        <h1>Chapter 2082</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's face looked paler and paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, the strange boy suddenly stretched out his hand and pressed his small palm on Lina's belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla and Lina were startled. Kyla raised her hand to remove the little boy's hand from Lina's belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, the middle-aged man standing behind the little boy suddenly said, "Don't touch him. You can't afford the consequences of touching Little Young Master."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla froze. The man spoke so confidently. It was as if something bad... would happen if she removed the little boy's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just as she hesitated, Lina gasped and said, "Kyla... It... It's alright..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She could feel the strong and rapid kicking of the baby slowing down and becoming normal after the boy put his hand on her belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla did not touch the little boy when she saw that Lina was seemingly getting better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy withdrew his hand after a while. He looked up and stared at Lina. "What would it take for you to give her to me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina froze. She was still in a trance. When she saw the boy's fingers pointing to her belly, she realized the child was talking about the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although the little boy and the middle-aged man behind him looked rather peculiar, Lina thought they did not mean any harm. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Especially since her baby&rsquo;s kicking calmed down a lot after the child touched her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"This baby is my treasure, so I can't give them to you," Lina said with a slight smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can't?" The boy frowned. "But I want to be with her. I can give you anything you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at the little one's seriousness, Lina could not help laughing. "The baby's still in my belly, and I don't even know if they're a boy or a girl. Yet you want to be with the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It&rsquo;s a girl!" the boy said with great certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked surprised. She did not even know the gender of the baby, but the child was so sure that she was pregnant with a girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The child was too serious at making things up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was also visibly surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina then quipped, "If you want to be with my daughter, you can marry her after she's born!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The little boy blinked his beautiful eyes. Then, he turned to the middle-aged man and asked, "If I marry her, can I be with her all the time?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The &lsquo;her&rsquo; referred to the baby in Lina's belly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The man replied respectfully, "If a man and a woman reach the legal age and become husband and wife, they can stay together all the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright!" The little boy looked up at Lina again. "I&rsquo;ll marry her when she&rsquo;s of legal age."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Huh?" Lina was instantly dumbfounded, unable to keep up with the little boy's eccentric thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The man standing next to the little boy looked as if everything his little young master said was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Grace had already driven over and said to Lina and Kyla, "Get in the car. We&rsquo;ll go to the hospital."</p></div>
