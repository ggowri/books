        <h1>Chapter 3467</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, if Daniel really transfers, you won't be able to see him anymore. I heard that his whole family is moving away from Emerald City!" said a classmate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica pursed her lips and suddenly turned around, walking towards the teaching building for the third year students.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The second and third year students were not in the same teaching building, and there was a tree-lined path in between.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As Veronica passed through the tree-lined path, she unexpectedly saw Mason and Daniel standing in a corner not far away, seeming to be talking about something, and Daniel's emotions seemed quite agitated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What were Mason and Daniel talking about? Why did Daniel's expression seem to have a kind of... sadness and anger?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She instinctively lightened her footsteps, slowly approaching, wanting to hear what they were saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, do you really think that everything will go as you wish if I leave? Does Veronica know your true face? Does she know how you destroyed her feelings, how you schemed step by step, and caused her to break up with me?" Daniel said angrily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She won't know, and you wouldn't want her to know, would you?" Mason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel laughed at himself, "Yes, I won't let her know. I won't let her know. The reason why I broke up with her was just because I made a deal with you. You used a business deal to end my relationship with her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We both shouldn't let her know, so naturally, she will never know," said Mason. "At least, if you fall in love with someone else, the pain she will endure will be much lighter than if you break up with her for money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His words seemed to have provoked Daniel, who glared fiercely at Mason. "And what about you? Do you think you're so great? Just because you're guarding her, do you think she'll fall in love with you? She's always seen you as a little brother, and that won't change in the future!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It was like that before, but in the future, it will definitely not be like that!" said Mason with absolute certainty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is that so? Mason, you're just deceiving yourself!" Daniel laughed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason was about to speak, but the faint sound of footsteps behind him caused him to purse his lips and instinctively look towards the direction of the sound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But with just one glance, Mason's face suddenly changed color.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I see Veronica standing not far away, looking stunned with a shocked expression on her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her breakup with Daniel was indeed due to some hidden reasons, but she never expected it to be related to money and business.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of a business deal, Daniel chose to break up, and this condition was proposed by someone she considered her closest "little brother".</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them were exchanging her emotions like goods.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even hoped that she had misheard just now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, when did you get here?" asked Daniel with an unpleasant expression, a hint of guilt flashing in his eyes. He hoped that Veronica had just arrived and hadn't heard too much of his conversation with Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Veronica's next words shattered his illusions with a blunt force.</p></div>
