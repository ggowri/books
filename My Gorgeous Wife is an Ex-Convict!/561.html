        <h1>Chapter 560</h1>
        <div><p>Suddenly, she shuddered. Drinking?</p><p>While rubbing her head, Lina opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling of the room. Little by little, the memory of last night came back to her mind.</p><p>Right, she remembered drinking a lot of red wine when she had a midnight snack with Hadwin yesterday. Then... She got drunk... After that…</p><p>Little by little, the relevant memories continued to float through her mind. She seemed to have gotten in the car with Hadwin. Then in the car, she kept touching him all the time!</p><p>She vaguely remembered saying something, but she could not think of anything!</p><p>In the end, Lina had to give up and stop thinking about it.</p><p>She could only pray that the words she could not remember were not curses against Hadwin. Otherwise, with the way he held grudges, he would think of a way to take revenge on her.</p><p>Lina got up and changed her clothes. As soon as she went out of the room, she bumped into her parents.</p><p>“Why were you drinking last night? If you hadn&#x27;t been with Hadwin and if he hadn’t sent you back last night, what if you were so drunk that you met someone bad?&quot; As soon as Mrs. Sweeney saw her daughter, she could not help criticizing her.</p><p>&quot;Hadwin told you to drink less, but you drank more. It&#x27;s inappropriate for a girl to drink so much alcohol!&quot; Mr. Sweeney also joined the criticizing army.</p><p>Lina could only keep nodding like a chicken pecking rice. She looked humbly apologetic but was complaining in her heart that it was the Hadwin they were talking about who made her drink!</p><p>It was a pity that her parents adored Hadwin. They believed him very much. Every time Hadwin came to her home, her parents were so passionate that it made her question who was their child.</p><p>Lina was a little afraid to imagine what would happen if she broke up with Hadwin in the future. Would it be too big of a blow to her parents?</p><p>After escaping to the bathroom, Lina looked at herself in the mirror. Her hair was a mess, her skin was pretty good and was considered fair, but her features were ordinary. She belonged to the type of person who was comely but not exactly beautiful.</p><p>She had never dated anyone. Although her relationship with Hadwin was a little baffling, it was also considered... Her first time.</p><p>Come to think of it, if she really dated again, she would probably never meet such a good-looking man like Hadwin. If only her relationship with Hadwin was true and not false...</p><p>Immediately, she burst out laughing and secretly scolded herself. What was she thinking? She and Hadwin were destined to break up!</p><p>They got into this relationship not because they were in love with each other!</p><p>Lina sighed, brushed her teeth, and washed her face. For her, their relationship was nothing more than an ‘atonement’.</p><p>However, she did not know that last night in the car, there was a man gently caressing her face while she was in a drunken stupor. With the most gentle voice, he had whispered, &quot;Then, you should like me well. You must like me very much, Lina.&quot;</p><p>It was joyful anticipation!</p><p>…</p><p>&quot;What? Brian won&#x27;t see me?” Evelyn&#x27;s voice sounded out of tune.</p><p>&quot;Yes. Mr. Hart says he doesn’t want to see Miss Cummins today, so please return, Miss Cummins,&quot; said the secretary.</p><p>Evelyn gritted her teeth. How many times has it been? All this time, she had been trying to see him, but she was always turned down.</p><p>From his private mansion to his office...</p></div>
