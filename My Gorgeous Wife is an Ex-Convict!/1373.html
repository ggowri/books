        <h1>Chapter 1372</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so? Then she was lucky," Hadwin Stephenson said casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, she was lucky enough to be found immediately and taken to the hospital. However, perhaps her luck had run out. According to the doctor, she was declared to be in a critical condition several times. She had only recently regained her senses. But yesterday, her doctor suddenly said she&rsquo;s in critical condition again. She&rsquo;ll probably be in a vegetative state forever even if she survives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason spoke slowly. His tone seemed like he was just talking about regular news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Hadwin Stephenson's expression changed suddenly. He got up immediately. "How can it be?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it surprise you?" Jason smiled. "After all, the news that the Stephenson family and the Jackson family will be merging through marriage has spread all over the internet. Everyone must have seen the news by now, and Lina is no exception. But you still seem to care about Lina, President Stephenson?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson seemed to realize that he had gotten too agitated just now. He glared at Jason and did not say anything for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Katherine Jackson frowned and gently parted her red lips with some displeasure, asking, "Hadwin, what's come over you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson pressed his lips together and sat down again. "Nothing."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason continued saying, "Of course, President Stephenson, you can go to the hospital and see Lina if you're interested. Maybe you can see her for the last time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His words made Hadwin Stephenson's face even gloomier!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace naturally knew that Jason was trying to provoke Hadwin Stephenson to see whether he still cared about Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that Hadwin Stephenson still cared about Lina. At least... he cared about Lina's life and death!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Then why was Hadwin Stephenson acting so indifferent just a moment ago?' Grace was full of confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Katherine Jackson said, "I don't think that will be necessary. I know Lina was Hadwin's ex-girlfriend, but now that Hadwin is dating me, I think it's better to avoid any misunderstanding."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, Katherine Jackson even turned to Hadwin Stephenson and said, "Hadwin, am I right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson pursed his thin lips tightly. Those deep eyes seemed to be covered with a layer of black gauze. No one could tell what he was thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Grace's phone rang suddenly. Grace answered it, and Mrs. Sweeney's crying voice sounded from the other end of the line. "Grace, Lina... Lina found out about... the news that the Stephenson family is about to merge with the Jackson family through marriage. She's... She's been agitated since then. What do we do? I'm afraid her agitation might affect her condition!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned before instantly getting flustered. Jay had only wanted to force Hadwin Stephenson to reveal his true emotions, but things turned out exactly as what Jay said earlier. Lina now knew about the news. 'How did that happen?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aunt, don't panic. How is Lina now?" Grace asked immediately even though she was worried sick herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she said that, Hadwin Stephenson's expression immediately changed. His eyes were staring intently at Grace. Anyone could see that he was nervous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Lina..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom... Let me... talk to Grace..." Lina's labored voice came from her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Due to the gradual improvement of her condition these days, Lina was transferred from the ICU to the regular ward. Then, this happened before she could fully recover.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed that because of Lina's insistence, Mrs. Sweeney could only hand the phone to her daughter.</p></div>
