        <h1>Chapter 3440</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel sat down at the table and casually picked up a magazine to flip through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Not long after, someone suddenly walked up to him. He looked up and saw that it was Mason. "How did you come over? Aren't you also here to choose books?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've already chosen." Mason said, shaking the book in his hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel saw that it was an original English book, and from the title alone, he could tell that it was a finance-related book.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This guy, who is only in his teens, reads books on finance? And in full English version too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, when I thought about how Mason is two years younger than Veronica and skipped a grade, I felt relieved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason pulled out the chair next to Daniel and sat down, but he didn't speak. He just looked at Daniel, sizing him up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This gaze made Daniel feel a bit uncomfortable, so he decided to start a topic and said, "You and Veronica have a really good relationship. People who don't know might think you're siblings!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Siblings?" Mason lazily stared at Daniel. "Do you really think that she and I are siblings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A sense of unease surged through Daniel's body as if the other person's words were hinting at something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"He's overthinking it," Daniel thought to himself and smiled as he said, "Of course, I think you and she are like siblings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Mason said, "There is no blood relation between her and me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There's no blood relation, so this kind of emotion won't be more precious," said Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What kind of feelings? What kind of feelings do you think I have for her?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel was taken aback, and the expression on Mason's face at that moment only increased his sense of unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"For me, she is the most important person and the one I want to be with for the rest of my life. If human emotions could be measured by instruments, then my feelings for her are probably much deeper than those for my parents, siblings, or anyone else," Mason said, looking directly at Daniel. "What do you think this kind of emotion is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel felt a dryness in his throat. Is it a sibling relationship?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kind of relationship cannot be called a sibling relationship, no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Or should it be called... Daniel suddenly didn't want to think about it anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Silence spread between them. After a long time, Mason spoke first, "Is this question difficult to answer? Or is it that Mr. Cross can't answer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel struggled to move his lips, "Sometimes, when you're young, you feel that something is better than anything else. But when you get a little older, you may not think so. Just like something I used to like very much, I found out that I didn't like it that much after I passed that age."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, do you think that my feelings for Veronica will also change in the future?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just want to say that some things will change with time," Daniel said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But some things will never change no matter how time changes," Mason said, the determination in his eyes made Daniel's heart sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Veronica walked over and looked at the two of them, "What are you guys talking about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nothing," Mason turned around and said, "Have you picked out the book?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm," Veronica responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason naturally took the book from Veronica's hand and said, "I'll go pay for it, wait for me a moment." He then walked towards the cash register.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel watched Mason's departing figure and then turned to Veronica, seeming hesitant to speak.</p></div>
