        <h1>Chapter 1607</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes," answered Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was in the hospital ward when she woke up, and Jason was by her side. "Why am I here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You fainted. I brought you to the hospital to have a doctor check on you just in case. Fortunately, there's nothing serious," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The memory of what had happened rushed into Grace's head. She instantly froze, and with a cry, she began to sob.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, what do we do? The child is gone... Gone..." She instantly threw her arms around him, sobbing and almost gasping for breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason put his arms around Grace and felt her body twitching violently with every sob. "What Secretary Wang said may not be true. If the child is really gone, why didn&rsquo;t he tell us where they were buried? Why would he rather get detained by the police instead of telling us the child&rsquo;s whereabouts?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">That was what confused him. He had a gut feeling that the child was still alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, if the child was still alive, what on earth was Secretary Wang up to by not telling them their whereabouts?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's... not true?" muttered Grace as she finally stopped crying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It can&rsquo;t be true. I'll continue to investigate the whereabouts of the child," said Jason as he raised his hand to gently wipe Grace's tears. "You told me not to cry, but you&rsquo;re the one crying instead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace only felt weak due to the emotional ups and downs. It seemed to drain her of her strength.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, is our child still alive?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alive?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She asked repeatedly and he would answer her each time. Finally, Grace stopped asking. She just wrapped her arms around Jason and held him tight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Jay, we must find our child, alive... or dead." The last two words were almost forced from the back of her throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She did not want to end up not knowing where their child was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">No matter how long it was going to take, she must find their child and tell him or her that they were their parents and apologize to them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She would apologize for failing to protect and take good care of them, for forgetting about them for a period of time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Okay," replied Jason. He would find their child, but at the same time, he would never let her disappear from his sight again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Jason and Grace returned to Reed Residence at night, the two children were still awake. They had been waiting for them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Especially Jasper Reed, who kept running to the residence&rsquo;s gate from time to time no matter how Uncle Kwan persuaded her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The two little ones would not go to sleep until their parents got back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Watching the two children's sleeping faces, Grace's eyes could not help turning red again. How happy would they be if their other child was here too!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Somehow, the image of the little boy named Ci, who was in the amusement park during the day, popped up in her mind.</p></div>
