        <h1>Chapter 2748</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She almost instinctively rejected love for fear of being hurt again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian had inadvertently barged into her heart, which also encouraged her to try again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps she could be happy too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Camille Strickland's eyes almost popped when she found out that her best friend and Brian were dating for real now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you and Brian dating on the premise of marriage now?" Camille Strickland asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah." Valda Theller nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's going on? Has Brian fallen for you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, no." Valda Theller shook his head. "He probably wants to move on, so... he wants to date me for real."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland frowned. "Why does that sound so strange?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller smiled drily. "It's a little strange, but he also said he&rsquo;ll try to fall for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But sometimes, relationships don't necessarily work out just because you work hard," Camille Strickland said with worry, afraid her best friend would get hurt again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "I know relationships don't necessarily work out just because you work hard, but you'll get nothing if you don't. Camille, haven&rsquo;t you always wanted me to find someone? You wanted me to keep an open heart, and now I want to do something for myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Camille Strickland sighed. She knew that her best friend might sometimes look naive and have no mind of her own, but she would stick to everything she had decided until the end. "I hope to hear good news from you soon."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could only give her her blessing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you!" Valda Theller smiled slightly, but she frowned again afterward. "Tell me. How do you make a man fall in love with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By showing off your feminine charms, of course," said Camille Strickland.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Charms?' Valda Theller blinked. "But the problem is what kind of feminine charm has Brian not experienced in the entertainment industry?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland agreed with the statement, so she asked, "Why don't you just do what normal couples do? Bond with each other first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What normal couples do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"For example, going to the movies, eating, shopping, traveling, or spending your day at home together. You've drawn so many romance comics, don't you? It's all there."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller was speechless. It was one thing to draw comics, but it was a different story in reality.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Anyway, they should try their best to bond with each other first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian came to visit Grace in the hospital, Grace was already awake and lying on the hospital bed. Jason sat at the head of the bed, peeling an apple for Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How are you? Are you okay?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I'm fine, but I might have to stay in bed until I give birth. I heard from Jay that you came to the hospital to see me yesterday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, I heard from Valda that you were hospitalized, so I came over," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "Speaking of yesterday, I need to thank Valda. If she hadn&rsquo;t helped me block those people away, I would&rsquo;ve been in more danger. I haven't thanked her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll thank her for you," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Jason had peeled an apple and cut them into small pieces. He brought a piece to Grace's lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace opened her mouth and ate the small piece of apple he fed her. It was obvious that they understood each other very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian watched quietly. Grace must be happy with her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He once hoped he could give her such happiness. However, he realized in the end that he was not the one destined to give her happiness!</p></div>
