        <h1>Chapter 3159</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Brian looked at the face that was so close to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her cheeks were slightly flushed, and in her round eyes, there was a hint of confusion, as if there were some twinkling stars, which fascinated him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She made him unable to resist agreeing to all her requests, even if some of them made him feel embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," he hoarsely agreed, "if you want to see it, then I'll dance for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His dance, he only performs for her, and only she can watch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Her eyes suddenly became brighter. "You're really willing to dance for me to see?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I am willing to dance for you to see," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She stumbled towards the sofa and sat down, wanting to watch him dance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled helplessly and gestured for her to sit down. Then he loosened his tie and unbuttoned the top few buttons of his shirt, undoing the cufflinks on his sleeves before starting to dance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps only he can make a woman dance like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All he's doing now is trying to please the woman he's fallen in love with!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pleasing her, that's all he wants to do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian is jumping around, while Valda holds her chin in her hands, watching him in fascination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her lips curl up into a smile, feeling surrounded by happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She truly feels happy now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Kyla and Martin returned to their residence, Kyla's mother had already gone to sleep with their daughter Trista, and Nelson had fallen asleep in the car when he returned. So Martin carried their son directly into his bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Martin put Nelson on the bed, and Kyla carefully covered him with a blanket before leaving the room with Martin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, we're tired tonight. You should wash up and go to bed early," Martin said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about you?" Kyla asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm going to the study. There are some work-related matters I need to attend to," he said, and then walked towards the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla watched Martin's back and unconsciously bit her lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the study, Martin wasn't dealing with any official business. Instead, he was staring absentmindedly at a blank sheet of paper in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Several times, he picked up a pen, wanting to write down his thoughts, but he couldn't seem to put the pen to paper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Should I write it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Should I tell her the code to release him from hypnosis?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Once, when he was deciding between hypnosis and his relationship with her, he thought that maybe for the rest of his life, he wouldn't have any connection with her except for their child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But who would have known that after going round and round, the two ended up being together in this way, reluctantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now they are only together because of some negative news that caused fluctuations in the group's stock price and affected the group's image, so they temporarily live together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, this "temporary" does not currently have a specific time limit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He and Kyla both tacitly avoided bringing up the topic of when they would part ways, as if they had formed an unspoken agreement.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If we could stay here like this forever, it wouldn't be so bad.</p></div>
