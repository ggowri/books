        <h1>Chapter 2492</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said indifferently, "It's a pity I&rsquo;ve never really believed in oaths. Oaths are the easiest to break. You said you would sacrifice everything for me. Does that also... include your life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Huh?' Whitney Cooper froze slightly before immediately saying, "Yes, that includes my life. Brian, it doesn't matter if I lose my life for you. I would've lived a life worse than death if you hadn&rsquo;t saved me!&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" He looked at her, but his eyes were still indifferent as if her speech did not affect him at all. "Then pay me back with your life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper was shocked. "What do you mean?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're no longer my private secretary from now on. I'm also withdrawing all the help I've ever given you. You have nothing to do with me from this moment onward.&rdquo; In his opinion, he could take back whatever he had given her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper immediately turned pale. If he took it all back, she would have nothing left!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he had paid off her family debt, that was all there was to it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could she willingly return to her old life now that she had a taste of luxury and knew what she really wanted? "Brian, you can't do this to me. I went to look for Grace because I... I was only looking out for you. I know I look a little like her, and I don't mind being a substitute. I can even... undergo plastic surgery to look more like her. I can talk like her, dress like her&ndash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Brian interrupted her before she finished speaking, "But you're not her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the beginning, he kept her by his side partly because he did not want someone who looked like Grace to end up being a prostitute. It was also because he wanted to use her as a substitute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he realized that he was only fooling himself when he saw Grace again in Deer City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having this so-called substitute was just him fooling himself and trying to escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian got up and walked to the entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper rushed forward and hugged Brian. "Brian, don't go! I was wrong. I won't go look for Grace again. Please forgive me! I'm content as long as I stay by your side!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if I have nothing?" he asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How could you have nothing? You're the crown prince of the entertainment industry and the heir of Hart Group!" Whitney Cooper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked coldly at the person in front of him and pulled her away from his side. "The woman I want to love will never be someone like you. It's my fault for making you my private secretary back then, so I won't take back what I've given you. But I won&rsquo;t give you anything more!&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that said, he left the house without hesitation. He left Whitney Cooper standing blankly alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having stayed by his side and listened to people whisper things about him made her clear how ruthless he was about feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His previous girlfriends had all begged him hard, but he still broke up with them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not even his girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What would she do in the future if she could not stay by Brian's side? What could someone with an average education and no professional skills like her do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Whitney Cooper was filled with fear and... hatred.</p></div>
