        <h1>Chapter 970</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian immediately walked up to Elise Dean and snapped. "Where's Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I don't know. I have nothing to do with this," Elise Dean said with a quaking voice, wondering why the crown prince would ask about Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace is just a paralegal. Why is the crown prince so panicked?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not only Elise Dean but others around them, including some who had never seen Grace before, were wondering what the missing woman had to do with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, maybe Grace just left because something came up. Grace's an adult. What could happen?" said Stella as she walked over to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After shooting a few scenes, she decided to invite Brian to the set.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She heard that the director was preparing for the next film, so she decided to use Brian to see if she could land a good role.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Who knew that the first thing I heard is a man shouting about Grace, and in the next moment, Brian's expression changed!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella regretted it. 'I should never have brought Brian to the set.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why is Grace everywhere?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'One way or another, I must expel Grace from Brian's heart!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, maybe later..." Stella's hand tried to reach for Brian's arm. She wanted to say that Grace might show up soon, so there was nothing to worry about.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had barely spoken when her hand only managed to grab a fistful of air. Brian raised his hand and choked Elise Dean's neck in front of everyone's eyes. "I'm in no mood to hear you say that. I&rsquo;m asking you, where is Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That handsome face seemed to be covered with a layer of ice, and the cold glint in his phoenix eyes sent a chill down Elise Dean's spine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this... the crown prince? He looks so different from the paparazzi photos I've seen online. He's not distant and indifferent but seemingly murderous!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It&rsquo;s as if... I'm facing death right now!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I really don't know," "Elise Dean said with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?' Brian's fingers tightened suddenly, causing Elise Dean's face to turn red. She could barely breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As if waking up from a dream, the people around them quickly surrounded Elise Dean and Brian, trying to pull them apart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Young&hellip; Young Master Gu, maybe Elise Dean really doesn't know?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah. Why don't you let her go first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't we... send someone to look for Grace around the film studio?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The crowd around them started discussing it noisily. However, Brian's fingers did not let go of Elise Dean. His phoenix eyes were filled with endless coldness. "I'll ask you one last time. Where the hell is Grace? If you still won't tell me, then... I won't spare you. It doesn't even matter if I have to kill you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone who heard this was shocked. 'Kill... Kill her? He could go to jail for murder! It doesn&rsquo;t matter to Young Master Hart if he kills someone for Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now many people just wanted to know who Grace was.</p></div>
