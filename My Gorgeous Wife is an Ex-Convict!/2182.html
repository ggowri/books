        <h1>Chapter 2180</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper looked shocked and was at a loss for words for a long time. Grace hugged her daughter, feeling sorry for her. Then, she looked at Philip Barlow and said, "Why don't you let me talk to William, Mr. Barlow? Maybe he'll be willing to meet us afterward."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I don't think that's necessary. William might be a child, but he's sensitive. He might need some time to recover from this injustice. I don't want him to suffer any emotional damage if you were to bother him too much. He's my son, and I should protect him, right?" said Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But we mean no harm, Mr. Barlow! We just want to tell him the truth and apologize to him," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll tell him the truth and send him your apologies. I suppose that should be enough," said Philip Barlow before getting up. "I&rsquo;ve ordered some specialties of Deer City. You should try them since you don't come here often. I have other things to attend to, so I won&rsquo;t be joining you. You can talk to the restaurant manager if you want to explore Deer City. He'll arrange a tour guide and transport for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Philip Barlow walked out of the restaurant once he finished talking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace did not expect the trip to Deer City to end like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper looked up pitifully. "Daddy, Mommy, boo-hoo... William doesn't want to see us. Is he still mad at me? Are you sure we won't get to see him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was just about to say something when Jason spoke first, "Maybe next time. We'll ask William if he would like to see you after Uncle Barlow conveys your apology and William's anger has subsided. Won&rsquo;t that be better?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"When you misunderstood William and were angry with him earlier, you didn't want to talk to him either, did you? Didn't you always turn your head and ignore him? He won't want to talk to you now that he's angry," added Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper wanted to retort, but she was at a loss for words. At that moment, she did not know what to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, why don't we eat first?" asked Jason. Grace looked at her husband in doubt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">They came here to see William, but what Jay said made her think he would rather not have them see William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper was absent-minded during the meal. When Jason arranged for their flight back home, Jasper refused to leave Deer City and insisted on spending the night here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Even if you stay in Deer City for the night, you still won't be able to see William if he doesn't want to see you," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I want to stay here anyway!" The little one hugged Jason's waist and said affectionately, "What if William wants to see me after he finishes his class? He won't be able to find me if we leave. Daddy, why don't we stay for one night and go back tomorrow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His daughter looked up with her face that was similar to Grace's. Those almond-shaped eyes of hers were especially similar. Her aggrieved and pitiful eyes seemed to cause Jason's words of protest to be stuck in his throat. He was unable to say them out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if was looking at a mini Grace begging him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If it were his two sons, Jason might have refused without hesitation and insisted on going back to Emerald City.</p></div>
