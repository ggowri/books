        <h1>Chapter 4029</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, that's not it, I-"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She denied it and wanted to explain, but he interrupted her, "Nancy, you...never really cared about me. To you, jumping off the cliff has already repaid me, so I'm no longer important to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her chest tightened, feeling his sadness in his expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wanted to soothe all his pain, but before she could say anything, Mick had already turned and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night, Nancy slept uneasily, dreaming of Mick and his sad expression. She even dreamed of him standing on the cliff by the sea, ready to jump...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" She woke up in a cold sweat, wondering why she had such a dream.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She actually dreamed of Mick jumping off a cliff, was it because of what Mick said during the day?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If something unexpected really happened to her, Mick would still be fine, not like in her dream!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The next day, she didn't see Mick, but she saw Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did something happen between you and my brother again? Yesterday when he came home, he was in a bad mood and locked himself in his room and didn't come out," Jasper asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We had some conflicts over the baby's safety," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper was stunned, "What kind of conflicts?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The doctor suggested taking the baby out at 32 weeks, but I want to keep it until 35 weeks. Your brother doesn't want to wait until 35 weeks, he's probably afraid that something might happen to me. I didn't explain it well to him at the time," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, maybe you really aren't afraid of death and are willing to sacrifice everything for the baby, but...my brother is too afraid that something might happen to you," Jasper said. "Although I know I'm not qualified to say anything, I hope you can also understand my brother. If something really happens to you, my brother won't be able to live!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's expression stiffened, "You...don't make jokes like that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Jasper was serious, "Do you really think I'm joking? Do you know what the only thing my brother said to me when you had a nosebleed and were unconscious for those 16 hours?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy felt her heart suddenly beating fiercely, as if what Jasper was about to say would scare her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At that time, my brother said that if you couldn't wake up, he would accompany you for the rest of his life. If you died, he would let me bury your ashes with his," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When my brother said this, she knew that he was prepared to die!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, Nancy's life is not only about herself and the baby in her belly, but also about her brother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hey, Nancy, don't cry! I'm not saying these things to make you cry, I just want you to know that you are really important to my brother!" Jasper suddenly shouted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned, she...was crying?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She wiped her tears with her hand, and her hand was covered in tears!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These were...her tears!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why...why did she only realize this now? Why did she only understand how deep Mick's feelings for her were now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did she used to think that even if something really happened to her, he would still live well?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was too self-righteous!</p></div>
