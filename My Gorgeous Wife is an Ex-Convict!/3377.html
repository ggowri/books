        <h1>Chapter 3375</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley arrived at the amusement park and took off her shoes before entering the premises. The security guard, due to being an adult, stayed outside and kept watch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley is naturally likable, lively, and outgoing. She takes the initiative to greet other children and believes that it's better to have fun with others than alone. As a result, in no time, a group of children followed Harley and started playing with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley was having a great time when suddenly his gaze caught sight of a 7 or 8-year-old boy standing in a corner of the amusement park, not playing, just boredly watching.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This big brother... looks familiar!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Immediately, Harley recognized him. He was one of the guys who had fought with them at her birthday party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, this older brother is a good person because he made the other few people apologize.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, she just couldn't ask for the name of that brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this point, Harley stepped forward and asked the other person, "Do you want to play with me? I can take you to play on the slide!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell recognized the familiar face of Harley and knew who he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Speaking of it, he usually doesn't leave a deep impression on people or things, but for her, it seems to be an exception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe she was the only girl who was so young and brave enough to come at him with teeth bared and fists flying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she was so small and everyone else was bigger than her at the time, she still charged forward with a face full of anger, even though she couldn't beat anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Does he not know whether to commend the other person's courage or to actually call her a fool?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I thought they wouldn't see each other again after that time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, we unexpectedly meet again in a place like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, he came to this amusement park just because he was bored. During lunchtime, he was dining in a private room on the second floor. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, he saw many children playing in the amusement area below. They seemed to be having a lot of fun, so he suddenly wanted to come down and play too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But when he actually went inside, he found it extremely boring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as he was thinking about leaving, the little one ran straight up to him and asked if he wanted to play and go down the slide together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Only someone like you would enjoy playing on a slide," said Lornell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley widened her eyes and looked surprised. "Don't you like playing on the slide?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I don't," he replied bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But playing on the slide is so much fun!" she exclaimed, as if she couldn't believe that there were kids who didn't like it. "Trista, Jasmine, and Tina all love playing on it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She even gave examples.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just because they like it doesn't mean I have to," he said disdainfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Have you ever played on it before? I'll play with you, and you'll definitely like it!" Harley said, reaching out to grab Lornell's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell's face stiffened as he looked at the small hand that had grabbed his. He furrowed his brow in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why would someone grab his hand like that? He had always been very cautious since he was young and wouldn't let unrelated people touch him because it could be dangerous.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And danger, sometimes, could be deadly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he had been grabbed by a child like this.</p></div>
