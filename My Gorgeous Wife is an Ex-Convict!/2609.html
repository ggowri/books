        <h1>Chapter 2607</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked intently at the woman in front of her. No one could tell which one of them was right.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, if Kyla meant what she said, it was just another three months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I hope you&rsquo;ll keep your word," Mrs. Weiss said in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's eyes darkened slightly. Mrs. Weiss was hoping she would sign the divorce papers in three months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes. In her opinion, she was only a woman who kept hurting her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I will," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she saw Martin Weiss standing at the entrance of the living room as soon as she turned around. She had no idea how much of her and Mrs. Weiss&rsquo;s conversation Martin Weiss heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mother, I told you to stay out of things between her and me!" Martin Weiss said coldly. Then, he walked up to Kyla and grabbed Kyla's wrist to lead her away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he felt Kyla stumble. She nearly fell after he had just taken a few steps.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He frowned and noticed that something was wrong with her foot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened to your foot?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I slipped down the stairs and twisted my ankle," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned before suddenly leaning over. He lifted Kyla's pant leg to check her ankle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm sorry. I'll walk a little slower..." Her words were barely out of her mouth when he suddenly picked her up in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla lay almost motionless against Martin Weiss's chest, unable to believe that he would pick her up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss did not wait for her reaction. He carried her toward the mansion gate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss stared at the scene until the two figures were out of sight before muttering, "Ill fate! Three months later... What then?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss stared blankly at the scene until the two figures were out of sight. She mumbled, "How unlucky! Three months later... What will happen... in three months?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Will my son still be willing to divorce Kyla by then?' Mrs. Weiss was unconfident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla finally gained her senses when Martin Weiss carried her into the car. "Is your wound okay? Is it okay to carry me like this? Will it burst open?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said as her hands reached for his clothes as if to take them off to take a closer look at his wound.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he grabbed her hands before she could touch the buttons of his clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you doing?" A cold voice rang in the car.</p></div>
