        <h1>Chapter 3950</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the expressions on the secretary and the high-level executives behind her didn't change much, their gazes all focused on Nancy's delicate hand held by Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy's face turned red when she saw so many people coming in, and she wanted to pull her hand back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But Mick didn't let go, instead he tightened his grip on her hand, "Don't move!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...you guys have business to discuss, right? No need to massage me, I can do it myself," Nancy said awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know the acupoints on your hand?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." She was speechless, she really didn't know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It'll just take a little while longer, won't delay much time," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, under the gaze of the high-level executives, Nancy received a hand massage from Mick. In order to avoid moaning out loud, she had to desperately suppress the urge to shout, making her face even redder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Finally, Mick stopped his hand movements, and Nancy felt like she had just gone through a disaster.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While Mick was discussing business with the executives, Nancy left Mick's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The soreness in her hands from being massaged seemed to have turned into a warm sensation, and her finger joints felt more comfortable as she moved them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It seemed that the massage earlier had been quite effective.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy went to the restroom, and as she was about to open the door to leave the stall, she heard someone outside say:</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Reed has been keeping that woman in his office a lot lately. She doesn't seem to be a socialite or anything. I wonder who she is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could she be some kind of minor celebrity? But she doesn't even look that good!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Women like her won't last long by Mr. Reed's side."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In a little while, she'll realize that it's not easy to enter the Reed family. A man like Mr. Reed can have any woman he wants! This woman is just daydreaming."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The voices outside gradually faded away until there were no other sounds in the restroom, and Nancy finally came out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the words she had just heard were hurtful, she was mentally prepared for them. In the eyes of outsiders, this was probably how she appeared.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she had never daydreamed, because she was always clear about her goals.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she achieved her goals in the future, she would eventually leave Mick's side. This experience was just a memory in her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After leaving the restroom, Nancy walked to a VIP waiting area on this floor. There were many Reed Group internal publications on a nearby display rack, and Nancy casually picked up one to read.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When she turned to a page in the publication, she was surprised to see a photo of Mick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a photo from an e-sports competition. Based on the text and accompanying images, it seemed to be a competition that the group had held, and the winner had played a one-on-one match with Mick as a post-competition activity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In this individual final, Mick directly defeated the champion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Seeing this, Nancy remembered that it was indeed the case. At that time, she was still in college and heard about it from her dormitory mates.</p></div>
