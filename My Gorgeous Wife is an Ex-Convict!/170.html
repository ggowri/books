        <h1>Chapter 169</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A proud man like him would never allow such a thing to happen.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"So, you're only willing to see me just to prove to me that you&rsquo;ll never agree no matter how much I beg, right?" She said those words with much difficulty.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His lips curved into a thin smile. He lifted one hand and lightly swept away some stray strands of hair along her forehead, tucking them behind her ear using his long fingers. "Back then, you said that you didn&rsquo;t want to stay by my side and that you didn&rsquo;t need me to help you change your destiny. You said you would not regret it..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His actions exuded elegance while his voice was so gentle.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He bent his waist and positioned his lips by her earlobes, breathing effortlessly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She could feel his breath blowing at her earlobes and neck region.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That made her stiffen her whole body as if a huge boulder was on her chest, leaving her out of breath.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm only seeing you because I want to let you understand what a joke it was when you said you would not regret it." He was staring right at her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At that moment, it was as if she had fallen into a lake of icy cold water.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">-</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">'Indeed, what a joke.'</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace could not remember how she left Jason's place.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">From the very beginning, he had not planned on giving in to her request. As for her, she did not have any right to request anything from him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That meeting was just her seeking shame.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The next day at work, Grace could not bring herself to focus. Her mother's relatives called to inform that her maternal grandmother's condition had worsened. The old lady had awakened, but she was not of sound mind and kept requesting to see her sons. There were also some things that she could not remember well.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The doctor informed that Grace's grandmother was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and it was progressing very fast. Usually, it took a person years to reach such a severe stage, but she had progressed so rapidly and might continue to worsen.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's heart felt heavy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was as if there were only bad situations in her life, and it felt like things would turn out worse.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, the doctor also said to let your grandmother see your uncles as soon as possible to help with her condition. How much longer do you want to lock them up?!" Her relatives were just short of accusing her of being heartless.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace bitterly smiled. The situation now was not under her control!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At the end of the day, Grace dragged her exhausted self out and was prepared to head home when Chase blocked her path. "Grace, I'll... I'll send you home. I have a car. It's no trouble to drive you back."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Chase blushed slightly when he said that.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace looked at the man in front of her, wondering how she should handle the situation to avoid hurting such an honest man. She knew that Chase had some feelings for her. She needed to reject him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She was not suitable for this man. If she accepted his kind gesture, that may do more harm to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It's okay, I don't live far from here. It's just a short walk," Grace replied to him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But you don't look too good right now," he anxiously said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm fine. Really," Grace said before walking past him and headed out of the Sanitation Service Center.</p></div>
