        <h1>Chapter 1851</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was also surprised. "Mrs. Watts, what are you doing? Get up and we'll talk it out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace tried to walk toward Mrs. Watts as she spoke, but Jason held her hand without letting go, thus preventing her from going over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay?" She looked quizzically at the person next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let her kneel as she ought to," Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace froze. She thought he was being as cold and ruthless as the Jay she remembered from long ago. There was even a surliness about him that no one could ignore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jason, I... I owe it to you... I owe your father so much. I haven't lived a good day in all these years. I've been thinking about how I could be heartless enough to leave you and let things come to this irreversible state!" Mrs. Watts burst out into tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was shocked, staring in disbelief at Mrs. Watts, who was on her knees. 'Could Mrs. Watts... be Jay's long-lost mother?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'How is that possible? How could such a thing happen?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Then, she heard Jason's icy voice in her ears. "You indeed owe us a lot, so now it's time for you to pay for your actions. Right, Mother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Watts turned extremely stiff. Her son had called out the word &lsquo;Mother&rsquo;, but he said it in an extremely cold voice that made her heart sink.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She knew her son hated her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That hatred had only grown deeper over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I think we should leave first," said Old Lawyer Watts as he helped Mrs. Watts, who was still in tears, get up. "This is not the place to talk. Let's go somewhere else to talk."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, when Old Lawyer Watts tried to leave with Mrs. Watts, Jason suddenly sneered and said, "Old Lawyer Watts, you can leave whenever you want, but she... has to stay!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What do you mean?" Old Lawyer Watts instantly had a bad feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What I mean is that she can't leave without my permission." As soon as Jason finished speaking, a line of men in black suits walked over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace immediately recognized the men as the Reed family's bodyguards.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The bodyguards surrounded Old Lawyer Watts and his wife.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Old Lawyer Watts could not help shouting, "What... What's the meaning of this?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The bodyguards easily separated Old Lawyer Watts from Mrs. Watts. Grace quickly turned to Jason and said, "Jay, what are you trying to do? Even if Mrs. Watts is really your mother&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Grace, don't forget what you said yesterday in the mourning hall. You&rsquo;ll respect my decision and let me settle the issues with my mother myself!" reminded Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But..." Grace saw two bodyguards pressing on Mrs. Watts's shoulders. "Mrs. Watts just got out of the hospital, and her leg hasn't recovered. What are you trying to do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What am I going to do? Since she came to pay her respects to my father, of course, I want her to kneel before him and pay her respects!" said Jason as he hinted at his men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two bodyguards immediately pressed Mrs. Watts down and forced her to kneel in front of the tombstone.</p></div>
