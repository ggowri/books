        <h1>Chapter 1414</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Shane Currey's voice was getting farther and farther away. Martin Weiss could not stop himself from trembling. 'Is she... only an ordinary woman?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'No! Kyla Corbyn has never been any ordinary woman. She's... the woman I love deeply!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The pain in his chest was getting stronger and more painful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The pain almost overwhelmed him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Perhaps only now was he finally willing to admit that he still loved Kyla Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Rather, he had thought that he could not love her and that he could eliminate her from his heart after sending her to prison and taking his revenge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it turned out it was all self-deception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If he did not love her, he would not care about her so much. He would not get jealous when he saw her with another man and even be so furious that he flew into a rage out of humiliation after mistakenly thinking she had made a fool of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He defended Paisley Daniels and was ruthless to Kyla Corbyn just to avoid his feelings. He dared not admit he loved the daughter of his enemy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The hands hanging by Martin Weiss's sides were so tightly clenched into fists that his fingernails pricked his palms. Blood trickled down his fingers, but he seemed to feel no pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Step by step, he walked to Kyla Corbyn's ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Of course, he knew which ward she was in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He wanted to see her. He wanted to tell her that he had been wrong, that he should have believed her and not humiliated her like that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He should not have laid his hatred for her father upon her and taken revenge on her in such a vile way!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He also wanted to tell her that he would treat her and Nelson well to make up for what she had suffered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, he began to grow timider as he approached her ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was afraid that she would look at him with hatred and she would not forgive him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was even... so afraid that he did not know how to face her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was so afraid that every step he took was hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Martin Weiss finally reached Kyla Corbyn's ward, he saw two men sitting on a bench in front of the ward. They got up and stopped him immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Mr. Weiss, please hold on," one of them said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You're..." Martin Weiss looked at him and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Master Reed asked us to stay here and look after Ms. Kyla Corbyn, saying not to let irrelevant people disturb her," he answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss was stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Irrelevant people... So I'm irrelevant too?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His heart suddenly felt a pang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss thought, 'How am I irrelevant? I'm the one Kyla once loved as well as Nelson's father!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who is Jason to prevent me from seeing Kyla? Even if he owns the hospital, he doesn't have the right!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He tried to force his way in as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, the two men did not give in. "Mr. Weiss, please leave. We're in a hospital, and it's late."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What if I insist on going in?" Martin Weiss asked grimly.</p></div>
