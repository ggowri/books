        <h1>Chapter 2294</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, Martin Weiss. I hope you'll walk the talk this time," Kyla said in a deadpan tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss smiled bitterly. His eyes seemed to have lost all their sparkle, and what was left was lifelessness. "Okay, I promise you. I won't show up in front of you again. We'll never... see each other again. I'll give you peace and we won&rsquo;t have anything to do with each other, just like what you want.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, she put away the food containers she brought over. Then, she turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she reached the doorway, she said, "You don't have to go to the hospital to get your blood drawn and stored for me anymore. Grace and Lina will help me. Even if my blood type is rare, they'll find a way to prepare enough blood for me. I won't need yours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss quietly gazed at her back. He felt like he was useless when she said she would not need... his blood.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps he was a useless person to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The ward's door opened and closed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stood alone in the ward, feeling his body getting colder and colder. The world in front of him seemed to have turned black and white.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I love you. I love you!" he whispered hoarsely. The tears that never fell in front of her rushed out at this moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His tall body trembled. He bent over, curled himself up, and wept like a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loved a woman so much but suffered so much because o fit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Which one of them had suffered the most?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who was whose inexorable doom?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla went downstairs from the inpatient department and saw Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With her slightly reddened eyes, Kyla said to Mrs. Weiss, "Aunt, I've made it clear to Martin Weiss that I&rsquo;ll have nothing more to do with him, except for matters that involve our children, from now on. I'm sure he won't stay in Emerald City any longer."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss sighed and said, "I know you're a woman of your word, Miss Corbyn. And I know you're considerate of my feelings as a mother. But your children also belong to the Weiss family. Here's a check for 30 million dollars. It&rsquo;s a token of my gratitude."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss said as she stepped forward and handed Kyla a check.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla gently pushed it away. "No thanks. Since I've chosen to give birth to my children, I&rsquo;ll do my best to raise them. You're their grandmother, and you&rsquo;ll always be their grandmother. That won't change with or without a check. If you ever miss them, you can pick them up to stay with you for a few days or visit them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss looked at Kyla in surprise, not expecting her to say such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even thought the woman would resent her.</p></div>
