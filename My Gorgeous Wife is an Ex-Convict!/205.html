        <h1>Chapter 204</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, when he met that person back then, it was right in this small town.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Except when he asked her about it, it seemed that he had overthought this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not her,&rdquo; he said casually. She was not that person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What? Doubt flashed through Grace&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this time, the boss of the restaurant served up the dishes. Brian said, &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s eat. Want to have some wine?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace recalled her experience of being drunk in front of Jason and swiftly shook her head. &ldquo;No need. I&rsquo;ll just have a regular drink.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thus, Brian got the boss to bring two bottles of beverage over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not drinking wine either?&rdquo; She raised her eyebrows.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be driving later, so I won&rsquo;t drink,&rdquo; he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her expression darkened suddenly as she thought of that car crash that got her to be sentenced. The charge was for drunk driving, but she had not drunk anything that day at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You had a car crash back then because you drove drunk, right?&rdquo; His voice suddenly sounded. &ldquo;Is that why you found a job sweeping at the Sanitation Service Center?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;At least I still have a job to do,&rdquo; Grace said self-deprecatingly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Do you want me to go say hi over at the Sanitation Service Center and get them to arrange a more easygoing position for you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No need.&rdquo; Grace refused. After all, a favor from this Master Hart was not that good to take.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian furrowed his eyebrows slightly. It was the first time he had been rejected like this. If it was not because she looked like the girl from his memories, he would not have opened his mouth and offered to help her change her job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace lowered her head to eat the rice in her bowl. Even when her head was down, she could still sense his gaze occasionally falling on her as if he was checking something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After some difficulty, they were done with their meal. Brian said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you back.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No need. I&rsquo;ll take the bus,&rdquo; she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;If you rush to the bus stop now, can you still catch a bus back to Emerald City?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she glanced at the time, it was already 8.30 pm. Even if she rushed there now, she would not be able to catch the last bus today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As for the train, she would have to wait until tomorrow morning before there would be one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you,&rdquo; said Brian casually. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want me to, then you can think of a way yourself.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bit her lip slightly. If she was asked to think of a way herself at this moment, she really could not think of one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then&hellip; thank you,&rdquo; she said a little awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She got into Brian&rsquo;s car once again. Grace sat on the passenger side, watching the night view outside the window. The song playing in the car was one of Teresa Teng&rsquo;s old songs&mdash;&lsquo;Man Bu Ren Sheng Lu&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt surprised yet again. She did not think that Brian would actually like to listen to old songs like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moreover, this song had even been set to play on loop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hence, only this song played endlessly in the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace unconsciously remembered that she had once really like listening to this song and even knew how to sing it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because this song was in Cantonese, in order to sing this song well, she had made sure every Cantonese word was being enunciated properly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">During that period of time, she had been at her grandmother&rsquo;s. Was it perhaps her happiest years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While the song continued to play, Grace&rsquo;s eyelids unconsciously drooped. Sleepiness slowly engulfed her.</p></div>
