        <h1>Chapter 957</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you have no further questions, then I'm going to leave," said Grace as she walked toward the conference room's door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before her hand touched the door handle, Brian grabbed her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, do you have to shut me out like this?" There was a note of impatience in his voice that was usually calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian felt a rare sense of anxiety, one that he could not even articulate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at the handsome face in front of her. His delicate features reminded her of another miniature face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back in the woods, the little boy with that face had once held her when she was exhausted from carrying him. "I'll be very nice to you. I'll buy you a lot of dresses. I'll take you to eat lots of delicious food. I'll protect you better than anyone else!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not take it very seriously at the time. After all, many children forgot what they said the next day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She then forgot about him and their shared memories after catching a fever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not aware that he had been looking for her for so many years! His obsession was deeper than she had ever imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only now, his obsession was with Stella.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'As for me... I've chosen not to say anything.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was not the one she loved. If he shifted his obsession to her, then there would only be more confusion. It might not be a good thing for him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not say anything, but the way she looked at him made Brian feel a pang in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a trance, it was as if he was seeing the little girl from his childhood staring at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those eyes... had appeared in his dreams again and again. He had wondered countless times what those eyes would look like when she grew up&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian could not help but raise his hand to caress Grace's eyes...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His cool fingers touched her warm skin, making him want to capture more of her warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened as her almond-shaped eyes closed slowly. She could feel his fingers moving over her lids.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's Bryn. The Bryn that went through thick and thin with me. It was all a strange combination of circumstances.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It felt like a dream to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If I hadn't lost my memories of him because of that high fever and if I had met him before falling in love with Jason, then I would've remembered everything&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Then maybe we would&rsquo;ve recognized each other!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'However, now&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace opened her eyes and pulled Brian's hand away from hers. "Mr. Hart, you should remember what you said on the hill. We're strangers to each other now since we&rsquo;ve gotten off the hill!&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian shuddered immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought he could do it, but now he found it so difficult to treat her as a stranger.</p></div>
