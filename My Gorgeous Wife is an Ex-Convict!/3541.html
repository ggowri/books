        <h1>Chapter 3539</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Come on, eat quickly. If you don't, the food will get cold." Jasper urged.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay." William responded and lowered his head to start eating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, in the corner of the cafeteria, a figure hid in the shadows and walked towards the side door of the cafeteria. Just before leaving, he glanced at Jasper and William who were dining with the corner of his eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wouldn't be long before he appeared in front of them for real!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted Jasper to taste the pain of being abandoned that he had experienced years ago!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wanted to make the princess of the Reed family fall from her high pedestal and let her taste the bitter fruit that she had brewed herself!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper has adapted well to college life and gets along well with the girls in her dormitory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is especially because she doesn't have any princess-like attitude, so others are willing to communicate with her. Of course, there are also many people who deliberately flatter her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The courses at school are not difficult for Jasper, and sometimes she even extrapolates more thinking points after learning new knowledge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What makes her even more satisfied is that the school has a dedicated piano room, where she can rent and practice the piano by the hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although her future focus is on music therapy, she has always loved the piano. After so many years, she gets itchy hands if she doesn't play for a day. Therefore, as long as time permits, Jasper will rent a room in the school piano room and practice for a few hours.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On this day, Jasper came to the piano room as usual to practice playing the piano.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While she was registering at the front desk, she overheard some girls discussing, "Oh my god, I never expected that person to play the piano so well, even better than many piano majors!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That piece of music is extremely difficult, and the technique is simply superb!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And that guy is so handsome! I've never heard of such a talented person in the piano major before!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Could he be from another major?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's also related to the music department, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper didn't think much of the girls' discussion. After all, on campus, girls often talk about guys who are good-looking and have certain talents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she finished filling out the registration form and was about to head to one of the piano rooms, she suddenly heard those girls say, "By the way, what's the name of that super difficult piece he played?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, that's the one!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper suddenly stopped in her tracks. Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige... The name was etched into her soul so vividly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because it was the piece Lawrence played when they first met.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was hearing him play this piece that led her to ask her father to find Lawrence, which ultimately resulted in the worst possible outcome.</p></div>
