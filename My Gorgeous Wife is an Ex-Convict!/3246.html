        <h1>Chapter 3244</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in her heart, she kept guessing whether he had seen what she was looking at just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If he had seen it, would he be able to guess what she was planning to do?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he had previously mentioned that if she wanted to say the code to release the hypnosis, it would be best to do it without him knowing, because if he was prepared, it might not work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Do you have something on your mind?" Kyla changed the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have a last-minute meeting to attend. I might be working late tonight. If you want to go back first, I can have the driver take you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need. I'll wait for you here. I'll call my mom later and tell her we'll be home late," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His eyes flickered slightly. "Then I'll go to the meeting first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Martin left, Kyla looked around the spacious office and walked to Martin's desk, where she saw her own photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was a photo taken in the first year of their relationship, when she was smiling and carefree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But her carefree days ended so soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla lifted her hand and gently touched the photo frame. She didn't expect Martin to put this photo on his desk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did he put this photo in a place where he can see it every time he looks up?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I just don't know if, after he's out of hypnosis, he'll still want to put her photo back in this spot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla let out a soft sigh. But no matter what, even if he didn't want to maintain their marriage at that time, she would still pursue him and be with him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because she believes that she is the only woman he has ever loved in his entire life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Martin returned to the office, he only saw Kyla lying on the couch, as if she had already fallen asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He furrowed his brows slightly, walked up to her, and took off his coat to cover her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I wonder if she will catch a cold sleeping like this. Doesn't she ask her secretary to bring her a blanket?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as he was about to straighten up, he hesitated for a moment when she murmured "Martin" under her breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't wake up and was still sleeping. The utterance of "Martin" was just a murmured sound in her unconscious state of sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Martin..." she murmured again, the words spilling from her lips, "You can't... leave me..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He stared at her fixedly, wondering what kind of dream she had just had to make her say such words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However... "Kyla, don't worry, I won't leave you," he said, lowering his head and placing a kiss on her forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">No matter what happens in the future, he thinks he will never leave her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Kyla woke up, she realized that she was in a car and Martin was driving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...am I not in your office? How could..." she said, looking a bit confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You fell asleep on my office sofa, and you looked so soundly asleep that I didn't want to wake you up," said Martin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So...how do I get to the car?" Kyla asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I carried you into the car," he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She looked embarrassed and said, "Did you carry me all the way from your office to your car?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She immediately looked embarrassed and asked, "So... how many people saw it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not far, the elevator goes directly to the underground parking lot. However, some people from other companies saw us over there," said Martin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kyla said, "Actually, you can wake me up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We are a married couple, so it's not wrong for me to hold you like this and get on the car, right?" he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hmm... that seems to be correct.</p></div>
