        <h1>Chapter 2565</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell continued to speak calmly, "No, I won't steal your daddy. I won't be with your daddy. I'm saving you because I want to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Confusion flickered in the little one's eyes. "Why do you want to save me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because..." She hesitated and said, "Others helped me when I was in trouble, so I want to help others when they're in trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But Mommy says you're a bad person. Why would a bad person want to help people?" The little one's childish voice was heard saying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You have to come to a decision whether a person is bad or not yourself, not just because someone says so. You must already be in primary school. You must learn to think and distinguish things yourself. You&rsquo;ll see whether I'm a bad person or not in time," Amber Mitchell said as she straightened up and raised her hand to caress the little one's head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the little one turned his head sideways and avoided Amber Mitchell's hand, making her miss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell looked at her hand that missed before looking at Simon's distant eyes. She tasted bitterness in her mouth. 'Yeah, I'm just a bad person to the kid.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was already a blessing to her as long as the child was alive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After everything she had been through, she knew better than anyone how precious life was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, have a good rest. We'll meet again the day after tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll save you whether you like it or not. If you refuse to accept that, get better. Save me when I need help in the future, and you won't owe me anything. You can also be very arrogant in front of me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell said to the little one with a smile. Her speech made the little one dizzy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was very resistant to the idea of the bad woman saving him! However, he thought it was nice to smugly save the bad woman after he recovered!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell walked out of the ward. George Gregory stood where he was with a bitter look on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What was I expecting? Was I expecting her to give our son a different answer?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had already said to his face that she would not get back together with him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he could not help but have some expectations.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Daddy, is she really a bad woman?" Simon's childish voice rang.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory looked at his son and said hoarsely, "She's not. She's the person who loves you the most in this world." Even when the doctor mentioned that the transfusion would affect her body and even put her life in danger, she said yes without even frowning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Aren't Grandpa, Grandma, Daddy, and Mommy the ones who love me the most?" Simon asked in confusion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory caressed his son's head. "You have to learn to distinguish right from wrong by yourself. Don't be like me. I thought I knew everything, but it turns out I was only a fool kept in the dark."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he had not thought of himself as always right, things would not have come to this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one blinked with a hazy notion, but he still said, "Daddy is no fool." His daddy had always been someone he idolized.</p></div>
