        <h1>Chapter 3633</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Suddenly, Jasper hugged William tightly around the waist and rested his head on his chest.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This took him by surprise, but having a beautiful person in his arms was not a bad thing, so he reached out and gently embraced him. "What's wrong?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just suddenly wanted to hold you!" Jasper said. "Our future will definitely be without regrets, and there will be no pain!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I misspoke earlier. Our future will be really good!" He would overcome all obstacles and make her the happiest person!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hasn't all his efforts been for this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"William, I want to kiss you, what should I do?" Jasper muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body stiffened instantly. She must know that when a woman says that to a man, it's a kind of temptation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it okay?" She lifted her head, her clear and beautiful eyes not hiding her desire for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, it's okay." William said. To be the person she wants to kiss was a fortunate thing for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper immediately wrapped her hands around William's neck and tiptoed, bringing her lips closer to his...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And he slightly bent down, responding to her kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She kissed with abandon and passion!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was as if she was clearly telling him how much she liked him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Naturally, William was happy to accept this, going along with her actions and matching her rhythm.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was willing to submit everything to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After this hard-earned kiss finally ended, Jasper's cheeks were flushed, and she licked her lips as if wanting more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, you see, some things are fine when they're not started, but once they are, they can become addictive.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Especially the feeling of kissing him, it's really nice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um...can we kiss again?" Jasper blinked her bright almond eyes and asked William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled faintly and said, "Sure, but aren't you afraid of being seen by the servants here later?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Even if they see us, it doesn't matter, right? After all, we're boyfriend and girlfriend, not doing anything wrong," she replied casually.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, we're boyfriend and girlfriend," he whispered, and this time, he took the initiative to press his lips against hers, initiating this new kiss.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He hoped that her liking for him would grow more and more, to the point where she couldn't be without him anymore!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>...Mason returned to the room, took off his jacket, and his gaze fell on a family photo placed on the cabinet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The photo depicted their family of six.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Raising his hand, he opened the picture frame. Inside the frame, there wasn't just this one photo. Underneath the Reed family photo of six, there was another photo.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was of two children, one five years old and the other seven years old, him and Veronica in the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the photo, the five-year-old him tightly held the hand of the seven-year-old her. At that time, she was his whole world!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His life revolved around her. The time he could spend with her every day was the happiest for him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the photo, she is smiling sweetly at the camera, while the blank and boring expression on his face creates a sharp contrast!</span></p></div>
