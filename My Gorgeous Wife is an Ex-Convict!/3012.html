        <h1>Chapter 3010</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she had accompanied him to parties before, the scale of those parties was not as large as they are now. Furthermore, at those parties, not many people knew about her relationship with Brian, and most of them just assumed that she was a temporary companion brought by Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now things are different. After Brian's live broadcast on TV, many people came to know about the fact that she is his girlfriend.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the evening, after returning to the villa, Brian had not yet arrived. Valda went to check her wardrobe to see if there were any suitable dresses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered that Brian had also bought her some dresses before, some of which she had never even worn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The dresses were not kept in her regular wardrobe, but in a separate dressing room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda walked into the room and opened the closet door, she indeed saw many dresses displayed inside, with various colors. However, there was no purple dress among them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Purple... Valda's expression suddenly dimmed. In fact, not only these dresses, but even the clothes he bought for her never had purple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No matter if it's dark purple, light purple, or any other shade of purple, there won't be any color in the purple family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered that Phoebe Cross had once told her that Brian wouldn't let any other woman wear purple clothes because that was Grace's color.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even... Phoebe also mentioned that there is a closet in Brian's villa, filled with purple dresses that Brian had bought for Grace year after year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That is... Brian's obsession.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this thought, Valda suddenly had an urge to go and see if there really was a wardrobe in this villa filled with nothing but purple clothes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as this idea came to mind, it was like opening Pandora's box. She knew she shouldn't, but she couldn't help but search for it anyway...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other side, Brian rubbed his forehead, looking a bit tired.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These days, his sleep at night has been very light, and he occasionally wakes up in the middle of the night, only to feel at ease after confirming that she is lying next to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What's wrong with him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Is he afraid that she will leave him again?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But even though he didn't say he loved her as Valda had hoped that one time, she still understood and didn't blame him at all. In fact, they continued to interact as usual these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But why does he still have such a feeling of unease?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even - impossible to shake off!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He furrowed his brows slightly as he thought about it, then dialed Valda's phone number, but no one answered the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He hesitated for a moment, then dialed again, but still no one answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Is she busy right now and doesn't have her phone with her? Earlier, he had asked the driver to pick her up from work and bring her back to the villa, so she should have already returned to the villa by now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, Brian made another phone call to the villa and the butler answered, informing him that "Miss Theller had returned two hours ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" Brian didn't say anything else and ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car drove back to the villa, Brian didn't see Valda in the living room. He also didn't see her in the bedroom or even in the study.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned and dialed Valda's phone number again, but heard the sound of her phone ringing in her bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her phone was placed on the nightstand next to her bed in her bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But she is not here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Where did she go exactly?</p></div>
