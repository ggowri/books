        <h1>Chapter 2611</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can I believe you? Don't forget. You told me countless times that you didn&rsquo;t love me," said Martin Weiss. He wanted to push her away as he did not want to see her eyes that were full of tears. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if one more glance would add to his heartache.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his hand had only touched her shoulder when she lowered her head and kissed his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her kiss was quick and hard as if she was trying to convince him of all the unexplainable emotions with one kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How can I convince him that I love him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'And how can I grow old with him? He used to be so in love with me that he could give up his life and health for me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But even convincing him that I love him has become a challenge.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla kissed him with all her heart as she slowly closed her eyes. Tears poured out of her eyes before trickling down his cheeks and merging with the kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stiffened. All his blood seemed to rush up to his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He gradually became confused, and his hands that rested on her shoulders became weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could push her away with a little bit of effort, but he did not do that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was he reluctant?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not help getting lost in her kiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her fingers caressed his cheek before going down the back of his neck, his collarbone...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the kiss was over, he heard heavy panting and could not tell whether it came from her or him. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His blood seemed to move with her fingers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even without those feelings, his body was so honest. She could easily seduce him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, I love you," she murmured as she sprinkled kisses on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Absentminded, he exhausted his last perseverance to gain some clarity. "You love me, but what can you do for me? What will you sacrifice for me? Children? Family? Friends? Or your life?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stopped her actions instantly, not knowing how to answer him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her silence cooled the heat in his body. "Kyla, how can I believe you love me if you won&rsquo;t sacrifice anything for me? Are you just saying the words? That's just the cheapest lie."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand pushed her body away as he got up. He said as he had his back against her, "Don't use this trick on me next time. Perhaps it used to work on me, but I now have no interest in you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was instantly alone in the room again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked down as she wrapped her arms around herself. It turned out it was so difficult to make another person believe in her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What could she sacrifice for Martin Weiss?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even if she used to love him so much that she could sacrifice her life for him, she now wanted to cherish this life because it had not been easy for him to snatch her life from the hands of death!</p></div>
