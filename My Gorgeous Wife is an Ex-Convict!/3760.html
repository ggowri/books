        <h1>Chapter 3758</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's just...I feel like you look different now, like you've really grown up," she stuttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think I'll always be a child?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, that's not what I meant. I just think you have more masculine beauty now." But after saying this, her face suddenly turned red.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was she even saying!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Masculine beauty?" He stared at her. "So you think I didn't look like a man before?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, no!" She denied it repeatedly. "You looked good before too, just...um, more androgynous. Now you're more masculine..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's true. You used to always want to see me in women's clothing," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's because you were cute and pretty like a doll before. I thought you would look good in women's clothing..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice grew smaller and smaller. Oh my god, what was she even saying? Veronica </span><span>lamented in her heart, feeling like she was making things worse.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No boyfriend would want his girlfriend to say that he looks good in women's clothing," he said. "Also, do you really think I look like a doll?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment, then nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the next moment, his lips met hers. She was stunned and completely frozen, as the kiss was too sudden and unexpected.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After a moment, the kiss ended and his cold whisper sounded in her ear, "Do you think a doll would kiss you like this?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She was sweating profusely. Did he kiss her just because she said he looked like a doll?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"And also..." His fingertips lightly touched her rosy lips. "Do you still think of me as your 'little brother'? Did you let me kiss you because you wanted a family member like a little brother? Or is it because you really have feelings for me as a man and a woman?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica stared at the person in front of her in a daze. Little brother?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Come to think of it, how long had it been since she last thought of the word "little brother" in her mind?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back when they were young, when he first kissed her, the shame in her heart almost overwhelmed her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she was only thinking over and over again, how could her little brother kiss his sister?!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, she just wanted to escape, to hide, and didn't want to break the facade of brother and sister. Looking back now, she had become accustomed to that kind of life and didn't want to change it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it possible that she was also moved at that time?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she found out the truth about her breakup with Daniel, she was more angry with him than with Daniel, because his place in her heart was much more important than Daniel's.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even after breaking up with Daniel, her sadness only lasted for a short time, and she rarely thought of him afterwards.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But she would always think of him, even in her dreams, she would constantly dream of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At that time, if his kiss was shameful, then besides shame, what else did this "shame" represent?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, I don't see you as a little brother!" She stared at him firmly, and their "attempt at a relationship" was a bold step they took together. So now, let her take the second step boldly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, I think I really like you, and this liking is not for a little brother." She said, this was the first time she didn't use the title she had been calling him since childhood.</span></p></div>
