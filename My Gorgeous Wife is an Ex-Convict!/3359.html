        <h1>Chapter 3357</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Harley and Jasmine are like two puffed-up little beasts. It seems that if one of them refuses to apologize, they will pounce on each other and start fighting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda's eyes became moist as she saw the two children fiercely defending themselves and protecting each other, while looking angry. She then looked at the other children who were injured from fighting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She walked step by step towards the two children, crouched down, and hugged them in her arms. "Thank you both. However, in this world, there are many people with different opinions. We cannot expect everyone to speak well of us. But we can make ourselves strong and not easily hurt by these things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda spoke while looking at the two children in front of her, "In the future, even if someone speaks ill of me, I don't want you to easily get into fights with them. Because more than being spoken ill of, I don't want to see you get hurt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Harley was a bit confused and didn't fully understand, but Jasmine was able to understand some of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But they..." Harley seemed unwilling to accept it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's just ignore it. In this world, some people will speak well of you, while others will speak ill of you. No one can be liked by everyone, but we can make ourselves better and make those who speak ill of us become fewer," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Upon hearing this, Harley reluctantly closed his mouth, but still glared at the girl who had spoken earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That girl was the only girl among that group of people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the Crypt families, she is also considered a precious little thing. But in today's fight, she ended up looking disheveled and her hand was scratched by Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was originally very angry, but when Harley gave her a fierce look, she immediately spoke up in anger, "Hmph, I won't pay attention to it. My mommy said that this is just the behavior of the weak. I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Enough." At this moment, a voice with a hint of childishness yet icy coldness sounded, spoken by a boy who appeared to be around 6 or 7 years old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And this girl, who is actually two or three years older than the boy, suddenly fell silent because of his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler frowned slightly and looked at the boy who had just spoken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That's Lornell Quentin, the future heir of the Quentin family. The Quentin family has been passing down their name for several generations, and if nothing unexpected happens, Lornell is the only one who will truly inherit the Quentin family bloodline in this generation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the Crypt families, the Quentin family is definitely considered a powerful force.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the Quentin family has only one heir, the depth of their heritage is unknown even to their own elders.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Chandler only knew that his father had once told him to avoid getting into conflict with Lornell unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even Hunter doesn't want to easily offend the Quentin family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So even though Lornell is 6 years younger than Chandler, Chandler has never underestimated him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now, Lornell suddenly spoke up, causing Chandler to feel a chill in his heart, afraid that Lornell might say something that would further escalate the conflict between the two sides.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, it will only get worse and harder to control.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But to his surprise, what Lornell said was, "Apologize."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, everyone looked at Lornell in surprise, especially the children from the Crypt families.</p></div>
