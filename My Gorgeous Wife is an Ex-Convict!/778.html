        <h1>Chapter 777</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if their previous quarrel and doubts had never existed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this what he means by calling it a day?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared blankly at the half-done cake in front of her. Just earlier, she thought she would be full of joy when she saw the cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now she found her nose somewhat sore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Call it a day... If we're just going to call it a day, there&rsquo;ll always be a misunderstanding between him and me.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I must make it clear no matter what!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, Brian and I really&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before she had finished speaking, his lips pressed hard against hers and silenced all her voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He sucked on her lips, ravishing all the sweetness in her mouth until he bit her upper lip with a punitive bite in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haven't I told you not to speak of the thing between you and him? I don't care what happened between you two. I just want you to stay by my side from now on."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found her lips burning but felt somewhat cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'So... he doesn&rsquo;t care for my explanations and doesn't believe me. Does he only want me to stay with him?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you care even if I tell you I've restored my memory and that I remember what happened to me and Brian when we were children?" The words escaped her mouth just like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, the surrounding air seemed to have frozen all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His pupils constricted instantly. The expression on his face changed. "You... remember?" There was a faint trill in his voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I remember," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face suddenly turned pale, and her face was reflected in his dark pupils.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out she had already remembered everything between her and Brian. It was ridiculous that everything he had done was just a futile effort.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Haha... Haha... Hahaha... You remember!" Jason burst out laughing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His laugh made her uneasy. Such laughter seemed to suppress something or to vent something, giving people mixed feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, stop laughing," shouted Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His laugh stopped abruptly as his sexy thin lips curled up. It was not like when he laughed earlier, but the smile seemed to be able to attract everyone. "Now that you know you're the one, when are you going to tell him? Or... are you going to find him to relive your childhood memories?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not what you think. Yes, I fell off a cliff yesterday, and when he grabbed my hand, I restored my memory, but I..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that... when you restored your memory? Well, Grace, are you going to betray me for Brian?" His lips were smiling, but his eyes were staring at her gloomily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him in shock. "You think I'd betray you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know, so you'll have to tell me!" he said, his voice so cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only felt as if her heart was getting heavier and heavier... Then, it kept falling!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, have you ever believed me?" She tried to widen her almond-shaped eyes to see every expression on his face!</p></div>
