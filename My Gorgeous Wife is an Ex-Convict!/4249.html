        <h1>Chapter 4247 He Believed Every Word She Said</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was practically using all his rationality and self-control to suppress this jealousy!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Finally, after Tina finished speaking for a long time, she said, "I've said everything. It's just like that. It's just that I... even though he deceived me, he also helped me. Now that one of his hands is disabled, I just wanted to help him. There's really nothing between him and me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler stared at the person in front of him. If there really was nothing, then how could she risk her life to save Kit?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If it was truly nothing, at most she would have helped call the police, not face the danger of being beaten!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But her first reaction was not to call the police but to go straight to him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina cautiously looked at Chandler, observing his expression. "Do you believe what I said?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I believe you," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina never liked to lie, so she truly believed that there was nothing between her and Kit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But perhaps this was something that only a third person could see clearly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina finally breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the doctor who was treating Kit's injuries came out and said, "The patient seems to only have some minor external injuries and a slight concussion. We need to do further examinations to determine if there are any internal injuries. For now, he needs to be hospitalized for treatment."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whoever is the patient's family member, please come with me to complete the hospital admission procedures," said the nurse next to the doctor.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Family member?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina thought about Kit's father, but that man didn't deserve to be called a father!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she let that man come and handle the hospital admission procedures for Kit, who knows what might happen.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm his friend, I'll handle the admission procedures," Tina stepped forward and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, please follow me," the nurse said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Tina was about to follow the nurse to handle the admission procedures, Chandler suddenly spoke up, "I'll go, you stay here and rest."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before Tina could react, Chandler had already followed the nurse to handle the admission procedures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what Tina didn't expect was that Chandler had arranged for Kit to be in a VIP ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the cost of a VIP ward was nothing to him, he had never liked Kit, right?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at Kit lying in the hospital bed, Tina said to Chandler, "Thank you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler replied, "Tina, stop thanking me for Kit. I've said it before, if anyone should say thank you, it should be him, not me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, he looked at her and asked, "What about you? Are you going to leave the hospital with me now, or..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Tina bit her lip. Kit's current condition made her feel uneasy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like he understood what she was thinking, and he said, "Then I'll go back first. I've already arranged for a caregiver to take care of Kit 24/7."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, Chandler hurriedly left.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he stayed any longer, he was afraid that his jealousy would erupt and he would do something he would regret!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the hospital room, Tina suddenly felt a heavy weight on her chest, as if something was pressing down on her, making it hard for her to breathe.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's departing figure made her feel so uncomfortable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Should she not have stayed here?</span></p></div>
