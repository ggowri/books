        <h1>Chapter 2121</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although she had thought of getting an abortion, it was so upsetting to hear it from someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had made up her mind and was ready to have this baby no matter how difficult it was. Was this the end of it?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I don't want to terminate my pregnancy," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss turned paler as soon as she said that. When he heard that the mother would also be in danger, his first reaction was to terminate the pregnancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As much as he cared for the little human life, he cared more about her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He almost lost her when she was suffering from liver cancer. How could he bear the possibility of losing her again when he had managed to save her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Kyla, why don't you take the doctor's advice? If you continue carrying the baby, who knows what will happen later? Besides, you still have Nelson. What should Nelson do if something happens to you?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'And what about me...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he swallowed the last few words and did not speak them out loud.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla felt a wrenching pain in her heart. 'Yes, I still have Nelson and Mom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If something happens to me, what should they do? Nelson's too young while Mom's too old.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'But... I can't give up the little life I'm carrying!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When she saw the tiny embryo in the ultrasound, the fetal heart rate, and the fetal pole on the ultrasound report, she had already accepted the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She was Nelson's mother and also this baby's mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Dr. He, you're the leading expert on this. Please think of something. I want to have this baby. I... I've been in good health these years. I&rsquo;ve not had any serious illness besides the occasional aches caused by the after-effects of my liver transplant. Besides, you only said that it&rsquo;s a possibility. It&rsquo;s not certain that I&rsquo;ll be in danger, right?" Kyla said earnestly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Dr. He sighed and said, "In this case, we need to conduct further examination and see the results. We'll also invite liver experts from other hospitals. Why don't you go through some preliminary tests first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said, "Wait. Excuse me. I would like to talk to my wife first." He looked at Kyla sternly as he asked, "Do you really want to give birth to this baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes," she answered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Don't you know how risky it is?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Unless it&rsquo;s 100% confirmed that it&rsquo;s dangerous for me to give birth to this baby, I want to give this child a chance," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss seemed particularly solemn. After a long while, he said, "What if I don't want you to have the baby?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She suddenly smiled. "Weren't you eager for me to have the baby? You were firmly against me getting an abortion at the time!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"It was different then!" Of course, he wanted the baby if she would be safe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, that did not mean he was willing to trade her life for the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was unmoved. She turned to the specialist and said, "Dr. He, do you mind arranging the test that I need to undergo and schedule a consultation? I want to keep this baby."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Dr. He looked at Kyla, then looked Martin Weiss, who had been silent. Finally, she nodded and wrote down the tests.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla finished undergoing the tests with the nurse's help and got into the car with Martin Weiss.</p></div>
