        <h1>Chapter 225</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick jokingly said as he was used to seeing his best friend change girlfriends all the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be strange not to see him change a new girlfriend every once in a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just that if the current starlet had really gotten replaced, she probably broke the record for being with him the shortest amount of time. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I do," Brian said casually, but he was still looking at Jason in the eye.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick had not felt anything yet, but Jason's face was already sinking. Even the air around him seemed heavy with seriousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hey, Jason, what's wrong with you? Why are you so serious?" Patrick asked. He was wondering why there was something oddly eerie about the atmosphere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason ignored Patrick and stared at Brian with his dark eyes. He suddenly smirked. "Is the extra your girlfriend's sister?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes. What a coincidence, isn't it?" Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason smirked even more, but his eyes were cold. "Yes, what a coincidence."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As he finished, he turned and walked toward the exit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick looked at Brian who stood next to him in disbelief. "Is Jason&hellip; leaving? He hasn&rsquo;t even been here for long."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at Jason's back with the same serious look.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you guys say something that I didn't catch?" Patrick asked. He thought that he had understood everything the two friends said, but now it seemed otherwise. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How else could they react in such a way that he could not understand?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Never mind. It's just that some things are too coincidental," Brian said, averting his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He also heard Patrick mentioned that Jason seemed to care about a woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He just did not expect that the woman Jason cared about would be Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace turned on her phone and was now casually going through videos while eating her takeaway food.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the moment, the video she was watching was an influencer's live stream show. The influencer was standing in front of a venue, live streaming Emerald City's elites' party tonight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The influencer said that by now, all the elites would already be inside. Although she could not to go in, she was outside guarding. She was hoping that by doing this, she could bump into a celebrity when they came out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Let's see how our luck will be today. Why don't you guys wait with me?" the influencer said while striking a variety of cute poses in front of the camera to attract the audience.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace, though not particularly fond of celebrities, did not really expect to see the influencer bump into a celebrity. She was only watching this for entertainment during dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The influencer started to interact with her live stream viewers, asking them to guess which celebrity she would bump into today. She even set up a poll session and so on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, the person in charge of the shoot reminded the influencer, "Someone's out."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With a turn of the phone camera, sure enough, there was a figure striding out of the venue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The influencer immediately got excited and hurriedly said, "I wonder who it is! I think it's only been a while since the party started. Are they out for something urgent? Why don't we zoom in and see who it is? I hope it's the celebrity we're looking forward to!"</p></div>
