        <h1>Chapter 1584</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, you could only win battles by having a deep knowledge of your enemy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Simona Menzie was followed by some of Emerald City's socialites. Many of them had their eyes on Jason as well and were gathered to watch the show. After all, with Simona Menzie sticking her neck out, they were happy to see how things would unfold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Seeing that Grace was quiet, Simona Menzie got even more aggressive. "Back then, you 'faked your death' to leave Emerald City and Mr. Reed. Did something happen? Someone said you left for some other man. Mrs. Reed, if you don't explain, there&rsquo;ll be a misunderstanding and your reputation will be affected."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Simona Menzie said maliciously, implying that Grace had cheated on Jason with another man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The socialites beside Simona Menzie were smiling with traces of curiosity in their eyes. After all, no one here knew what Grace had done in the past five years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace looked at Simona Menzie coldly and suddenly sneered, "Someone said? Miss Menzie, why don't you tell me who that someone is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Simona Menzie's expression froze. She had not introduced herself but Grace called her &lsquo;Miss Menzie&rsquo; right away. In other words, she knew who she was?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Of course, it's somebody else. I'm not at liberty to say who it is," said Simona Menzie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Not at liberty? Miss Menzie, if you won't say who it is, can I assume that this someone doesn't exist and all this slander is coming from you?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Simona Menzie's expression changed as she said hastily, "I never said anything like that. Don't you slander me like that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said calmly and coldly, "Miss Menzie, aren't you the one slandering me? Me leaving for another man? You said that yourself, didn't you? You said someone else said it but you won't say who it was. Legally speaking, you were the one who said it! You'll lose if I decide to sue you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Simona Menzie's face instantly turned grim. She wanted to embarrass Grace at first. She thought Grace would have nothing on her, but who knew things would become so serious?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I... I don't remember who said it. Mrs. Reed, there's no need for you to be so aggressive!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Excuse me, do I have to be gentle and nice when someone slanders me?" Grace looked as if she had heard a joke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Simona Menzie's face was red. None of the people who followed her over stood up for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Everyone could see that Mrs. Reed was not someone who let others ride roughshod over her. She even caught Simona Menzie&rsquo;s weakness in an instant, putting Simona Menzie at a disadvantage.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You... Why are you so hesitant to explain it if you haven't done anything shameful? You even mentioned something about suing? Isn&rsquo;t it because of your guilty conscience?" Simona Menzie blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, her face turned from red to pale as soon as she said it. By saying this, she had declared her stance and opinion. Besides, could one say the word &lsquo;shameful&rsquo; so casually?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If anyone here spread her words just now, the consequences she would have to face tomorrow... Simona Menzie shuddered at the thought of this. She was about to say something else to make up for it but another voice rang out...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Since when do you have the right to question my wife?"</p></div>
