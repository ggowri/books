        <h1>Chapter 4365 Can I Be Your Friend?</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That was Calvert. He had seen him before when he was looking for Harley near the school.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, after breaking off his engagement with Harley, he heard the name Calvert mentioned </span><span>again. So, he specifically went online to look up information related to Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was a newly debuted model, still in college, but his photos had received quite a bit of praise in the industry. The clothes he modeled had seen a significant increase in sales, making him quite popular in the modeling circle in a short period.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, quite a few voices said that Calvert, the model, was just riding on the coattails of Harley. If it hadn't been for Harley, Calvert would have been nothing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, in the entertainment industry, there was no shortage of these glamorous models.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, had Harley taken a liking to Calvert?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he thought that Calvert was just an average guy apart from his good looks, for girls like Harley, being handsome was probably the most important thing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley seemed to sense Lornell's gaze on something behind her. She turned around and spotted Calvert standing not far away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did you get here?" Harley asked, surprised.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just got here and wanted to say hi, but I saw you chatting with Mr. Quentin, so I didn't come over," Calvert said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, Calvert knew Lornell!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he originally didn't know who Lornell was, the news about the Hart family calling off their engagement was all over the internet, so naturally, he would know who Lornell was!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've pretty much finished chatting with Mr. Quentin, and it just so happens I have something to discuss with you too!" Harley said, heading towards Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Harley!" Suddenly, a hand fiercely grabbed hers.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley paused, turning to look at Lornell. "Is there something else?" he asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you really going with him?" Lornell asked, feeling that if he let go at this moment, some things might never be able to change again.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's my friend, I don't see any problem with having a chat with him." Harley gave a light laugh, then gently pulled away from Lornell's grasp, "Goodbye."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>With just a soft "goodbye" from Harley, Lornell shuddered, feeling as if a piece of his heart had suddenly been hollowed out.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley approached Calvert: "Let's go."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Calvert responded, following alongside Harley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them walked away side by side. Lornell stared blankly at Harley's retreating figure, his hand hanging by his side slowly clenched into a fist. "Harley," he muttered, "one day, you'll regret this!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley and Calvert moved to another quiet corner before she finally stopped, turned her head to look at him, and said, "Long time no see."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it's been a while."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're doing pretty well, aren't you? I've heard a lot about you lately. You've even managed to land a steady job. Things are only going to get better from here. Who knows, in a few years, you might become the top model!" Harley said with a smile.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can I be your friend when that time comes?" Calvert asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley looked at the other person in surprise.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert explained, "I know, when you told Mr. Quentin that I was your friend, you were just trying to save me from embarrassment. I'm not oblivious!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Harley was a princess held in high esteem. The more he worked in the entertainment industry, the more he understood her noble status!</span></p></div>
