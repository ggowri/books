        <h1>Chapter 1353</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Jason smiled as he held Grace and sat her on his lap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She cried out in surprise and subconsciously put her arms around his neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How much do you care about me?" His face was close to hers, and his beautiful, alluring eyes gazed at her lovingly and gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were like the mountain lake on a spring day, and she could not help drowning in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blushed slightly and said, "I'll&hellip; make really good preparations for your birthday. Besides, I already have your birthday present in mind. You can't dislike it when I give it to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyelashes fluttered a little. "No matter what you give me, I won't dislike it. But my birthday..." He hesitated a little. "I don't want anyone else there. Can it just be the two of us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was slightly stunned. "Just the two of us?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I don't need anyone else for my birthday," he muttered with a glint of gloom in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why is that?" she could not help asking, not missing the gloom in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pressed his thin lips together and buried his head deep into her neck. She could feel his breathing become heavy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if there was something heavy hiding in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, we're married now. You can tell me anything. Even though I can't help you, at least I can hear you out," Grace said gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He held her a little tighter. To him, she was the only person in the world he could rely on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could only show his vulnerability in front of her. "That woman left my father and me the day after my birthday."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned. After a moment, she realized that by &lsquo;that woman&rsquo;, he meant his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought everything was so wonderful at the time. It was like a sweet dream. On my birthday, she stopped arguing with my father and bought me a small cake, but the next day, the sweet dream shattered..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His voice hung in the air, and he spoke in a calm, unconcerned tone as if he was just talking about a common topic. However, each word he said made Grace feel depressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No matter how my father and I begged, she never looked back and just left. My father wouldn't have died if she hadn't left... Tell me, why did she give me a sweet dream only to shatter it so ruthlessly?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He muttered. He finally heaved as he said the last sentence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gently wrapped her arms around his back, hugging the man in front of her. How long had he kept these words in his heart?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had always known that his mother was a wound in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a good thing he was willing to talk about it now. At least, he was no longer burying this pain at the bottom of his heart but was willing to share it with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jay, from now on, your birthdays won't be fragile sweet dreams anymore. Every birthday from now on will be a beautiful memory of us," she said.</p></div>
