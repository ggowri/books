        <h1>Chapter 2291</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such an unequal relationship would only increase each other's burden in the end!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They might as well cut it off now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Time passed day by day, and Kyla went to the hospital frequently. Every time she visited him, she cherished their time together as it might become good memories for her to recall in the future. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had too few good memories together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, the doctor said I can be discharged tomorrow." Martin Weiss told her the news as soon as she stepped into the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze. 'Tomorrow? How... How soon!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">By tomorrow, they would end things once and for all... The thought of it stung her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened? Why do you look so pale?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"N-Nothing." She forced a smile. "Time flies. You'll be out of the hospital tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does it? I think it passes slowly," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss, who was in the ward, looked at them and said, "Why don't you two have a good chat? I'll go out for a minute."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss got up as she spoke. She looked at Kyla, hinting at her before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla knew it was time for her to end everything! She would remember their brief time together for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, Kyla placed the food containers on the table of his hospital bed as usual. Then, she opened them one by one to let him eat what she had cooked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss ate the food. When he finally had the osmanthus rice porridge that Kyla made, he said, "Your osmanthus rice porridge is really good. Whenever I want to have it again, can you make it for me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "What's the matter? Is it too much trouble to do this? If it is, then there's no need to&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin Weiss, didn't you say you're waiting for my answer?" Kyla asked suddenly as she looked him straight in the eye. "I think I should be able to give you an answer now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss froze. Then, his face lit up. "You want to answer me now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes!" she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was tension and expectation in his eyes. Eventually, it became intense affection. "Kyla... will you start over with me and be a real married couple with me? I promise I&rsquo;ll never let you down. I&rsquo;ll spend the rest of my life loving you and treating you well!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt a soreness spreading in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The man really loved her, but... she was destined not to give him the answer he wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I won't." She heard her voice say, and the soreness in her heart turned to pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's expression changed instantly. The anticipation and love in his eyes turned to disbelief. It was as if he did not expect her to say no.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been&hellip; so gentle toward him, cooking for him every day. She was willing to hold his hand and accompany him to sleep... All these made him think she was willing to open her heart to him and that he had a place in her heart!</p></div>
