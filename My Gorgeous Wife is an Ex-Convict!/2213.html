        <h1>Chapter 2211</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stabilized himself, but his eyes were still closed and his hand was on his forehead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla only saw Martin Weiss's ghastly pale face in the moonlight. Even his lips seemed grayish. She was supporting him, so her hand touched his. She found it dreadfully cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, Martin Weiss finally opened his eyes slowly and stood up straight. "I'm going home."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened to you?" Kyla could not help asking. He seemed weak. Even though he was standing on his feet, he seemed shaky. It was as if he would fall any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Me?" Martin Weiss froze slightly before smiling nonchalantly. "I'm fine. I'm alright." However, only he knew that his body was so tired that every gesture seemed to weigh a thousand pounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He should have gone back to have a good rest after having his blood drawn, but he longed to see her. Therefore, he came here again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though the store was closed, just seeing the lights inside made him feel closer to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you sure you're alright?" she asked doubtfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm really fine... I'm sorry... to have bothered you. I... I'll let you go. I really will," he said. However, the words came out in a stammer. His hand tried to open the door to the driver's seat, but it did not open the first time. It was not until the second attempt that he managed to open it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was feeling a little lightheaded again. He shook his head violently and was about to get into the driver's seat when a hand grabbed his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss froze and looked blankly at Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're not in the right state to drive!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... fine. I'm just a little... tired today, but I can still drive," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his face seemed paler in the moonlight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Follow me inside to drink some warm water. You might get into an accident if you drive in this state."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was slightly dumbfounded. He only came back to his senses after following Kyla inside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He went in with her. He never thought he would be allowed inside again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"My mother and Nelson are already asleep. Keep your voice down so you don't wake them," said Kyla as she poured a glass of warm water and handed it to Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss took the water and drank it. The warm water made the chill in his body fade away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you for letting me in. I thought you wouldn't care if I lived or died," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "I don't. I wouldn&rsquo;t care whether you lived or died if we didn&rsquo;t have children. But you're still the children&rsquo;s father. My father died when I was in school. I don't want my children to be fatherless too."</p></div>
