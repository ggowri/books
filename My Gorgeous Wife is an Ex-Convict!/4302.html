        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His body stiffened </span><span>suddenly,</span><span> his gaze fixed on her. After a while, he finally spoke. "You're drunk."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm not drunk, I'm very clear-headed!" Tina said. "I drank because I was afraid that if I didn't, there are some things I wouldn't be able to say smoothly!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She reached out and hugged him. "Chandler, I don't want us to end like this. Since I once deeply loved you, I will still fall in love with you, right? I knew all your kindness before had a purpose, and I was angry, so I decided to divorce you, but now I regret it a little."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted being so impulsive in asking for a divorce.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She regretted not thinking more at that time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although he had a purpose, he never harmed her, always just cared for her, protected her, and even loved her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gradually intensifying love for her can be seen in those preserved video recordings!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That kind of love cannot be pretended!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at that time, she was blinded by anger and never thought about whether his love for her </span><span>was real or fake.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Chandler, let's get back together, okay?" Tina mustered up the courage to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He pursed his thin lips tightly, his deep black eyes fixed on her for a long time before he said, "Why are you suddenly saying these things to me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" She paused for a moment, "Because I realized that I like you, maybe even love you. Even if I forgot our past memories, it's only natural for me to fall in love with you again, just like how I loved you so much before."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Because you love me, you want to have a second child with me, right?" Chandler said softly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina blinked, "If that's what you're saying, then yes, I do want to have another child with you." It's only natural that it would be best for the child if they loved each other.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to help him lift the curse sooner. Seeing him in excruciating pain during the curse attacks shocked and pained her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were even times when she dreamt of him in that state.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to approach him, to make him feel less pain, but she couldn't even get close to him, she could only watch him suffer helplessly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That feeling of powerlessness, even after waking up from the dream, still deeply imprinted itself in her body, causing her extreme discomfort.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at Tina in front of him and suddenly smiled faintly, "Tina, you're truly kind."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Tina's eyes flickered with confusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it because you want to save me? You don't want me to use dangerous methods like summoning the curse, so you're willing to have another child in this way? Do you think that if you say you love me, I will agree to have this child? But Tina..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler slowly pulled Tina's hand away from his body, "I don't want your sympathy or pity, and I don't need you to say you love me like this, so I won't be with you. I reject your proposal."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying this, the car arranged by the restaurant had already arrived in front of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler opened the car door, let Tina get in, and then sat beside her before giving the driver the address of the Stephenson family mansion.</span></p></div>
