        <h1>Chapter 1970</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She asked tentatively, "Well... Do you still love me? But you're just too embarrassed to forgive me so easily, so... you hope I&rsquo;ll continue pestering you a month later?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson glared at Lina. 'Does she have to talk about these things so frankly?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although... he was doing exactly what she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is it true?" She demanded to know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He turned his back, only thinking that he would lose his restraint if she continued looking at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Is it true or not?" She quickly walked around and continued to stare at his face, her hands pulling restlessly at one of his arms. "I didn't misunderstand, did I?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He glared at her. The woman had always been able to drive him into a corner!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"... Yes!" He said gruffly and went straight back to his desk to look at the documents piled on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's face was full of joy. 'He admitted it! It's really as I thought. He still has feelings for me, but I just hurt him too deeply before.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina then approached Hadwin Stephenson's desk. "Hadwin, when are you going to forgive me? Two months? Three months? Or six months? Isn't six months a little long? The baby will be born by then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hadwin, at least give me a time frame so I can prepare myself mentally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why don't we have a forgiveness dinner on the day you forgive me? It'll serve as a day of commemoration to also remind us not to have any more misunderstandings."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She chattered as if she had come out of her shell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson was speechless. 'Forgiveness dinner... How did she come up with that? And she&rsquo;s even trying to bargain with me on when I'm going to forgive her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"By the way, Hadwin, I love you. I love you so much!" Lina widened her round eyes and looked intently at Hadwin Stephenson as she confessed her feelings to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson instantly blushed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hey, Hadwin, your face looks a little red..." Lina blinked and put her hands on Hadwin Stephenson's cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He should take her hands off him. She was distracting him from his work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hey, your ears are turning red too!" As if discovering something new, her hands began to creep up his ears again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">At that instant, Hadwin Stephenson felt blood rushing to his face. Even his ears turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You..." He glared at her. "Quit it," he said with a doting tone that even he could not describe. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said with a smile, "I'm not messing around. I'm just happy. Hadwin, thank you for forgiving me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson pressed his lips together and said grudgingly, "I haven't forgiven you yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But you'll forgive me sooner or later, won't you? Hadwin, I want to spend every day with you from now on!" Lina cupped her cheeks as she began to dream of a better future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson momentarily froze before saying, "Ask your parents if they&rsquo;re free tonight. I haven't even invited them to dinner ever since they came."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was delighted. She hurriedly answered on her parent's behalf, "They're free. They're free. I'll call my parents and tell them!" With that said, she began to call her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at Lina's reaction, Hadwin Stephenson could not help smiling. He found that the previous pressure in his chest was fading away.</p></div>
