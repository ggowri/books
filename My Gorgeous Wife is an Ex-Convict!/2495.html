        <h1>Chapter 2493</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Grace must have told on me. Otherwise, how would Brian have known?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's all Grace's fault! I&rsquo;ll make Grace pay one day!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The fact that the three members of the Mitchell family were detained by the police as suspects had gone viral.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was waiting for her in-laws to bring their grandson back to Deer City. As soon as her in-laws returned, George Gregory would be forced to do something even if he did not want to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not expect to find a divorce lawyer in the detention center. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He... wants to divorce me?" Louise Mitchell asked in disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, this is the divorce agreement. Mr. Gregory has already signed it. It&rsquo;ll come into effect once you sign it and go through the standard procedures. You two have a prenuptial agreement, so there's nothing to argue about. We'll follow the agreement. Mr. Gregory wants custody of the child. Miss Mitchell, it&rsquo;ll be difficult for you to obtain custody even if you go to court due to your current situation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lawyer spoke about the details of the divorce formally.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell did not want to listen to him and was boiling in anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory had chosen to divorce her. How could he do that? She even willingly handed over most of Mitchell Group's profits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he tossed her these divorce papers and kicked her aside as soon as the Mitchell family was in trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want to see George Gregory. Tell him to see me, or I'll never sign the divorce papers!" Louise Mitchell said bitterly. With that said, Louise Mitchell left the meeting room with the staff nearby without waiting for an answer from the lawyer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the lawyer told George Gregory what Louise Mitchell had said, George Gregory spoke as if he had predicted it, "What else did she say?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That&rsquo;s all. She only said she wants to see you, and she won&rsquo;t sign the agreement if she doesn&rsquo;t," the lawyer replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, got it. You can go out first," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The lawyer left the study. Old Madam Gregory came in and asked worriedly, "Do you really want to divorce Louise Mitchell?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," George Gregory said without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Although what happened to her is embarrassing, she&rsquo;s still Simon's mother. If you two divorce, Simon&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, the elderly like her wanted the family to be complete.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want a divorce all the more just because she's Simon's mother. That way, I'll get Simon's custody. If I let her continue living with Simon, her evilness will affect Simon sooner or later," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Madam Gregory sighed. When they came back, their son talked about getting a divorce and said that Louise Mitchell had cut off Amber Mitchell's finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Old Madam Gregory was shocked to hear this. She did not expect her daughter-in-law to seem modest and sensible but was actually such a ruthless person. She could even do such a thing to her own sister. How scheming.</p></div>
