        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's true," Roger said. "In fact, using chemical knowledge to kill someone can be very simple sometimes, like with explosives, poisons, or..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His voice trailed off, and his dark eyes gazed at her intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Jasper felt her heart racing, a sense of inexplicable danger rising within her. It was like her body's instinct was urging her to escape from this boy in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But why would she feel this way?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, these chemicals need to be handled with caution to avoid any misuse by malicious individuals," Jasper quickly interjected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, we should definitely pay attention to safety," Roger agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about you? Did you choose to study chemistry because you like it?" she asked, changing the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just have some interest in it. Different chemicals, when combined, can create different reactions that can either save lives or take them. Don't you think that's fascinating?" he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um..." She had never heard anyone describe chemistry that way before. "I just find it dangerous."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So what do you like? Piano?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, I do like piano," he admitted. "I even thought that piano was something I would strive for all my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then why didn't you choose music as your major?" she asked curiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because it's not very useful," he chuckled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not useful?" She frowned, not agreeing with him. "How can it be useless? Music can cultivate sentiment, make people feel happy, and even like me, I'm studying music therapy. In the future, I can use music to treat patients."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But what's the use of it?" he asked with a smile. "If you throw a musician into a deserted place, you'll find that music, apart from self-satisfaction, has no use for your survival."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She hesitated, "Anyway, music can be a spiritual food, it can relieve stress, even in times of war, music can boost morale!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Usually, people who say such things are those who are materially rich. In times of famine, no one will think of music, and as for war, the premise of music's inspiring effect is that you still have enough soldiers, otherwise, it has no effect at all."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper bit his lip, even though the person in front of him played the piano so well, he still said that music was useless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Since it's useless, why do you always go to the piano room to practice?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's to remind myself not to forget certain things," he said. Only through repeated piano practice could he constantly tell himself to be ruthless and not to be soft-hearted. The reason he came back was to settle the unresolved hatred of the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What things should not be forgotten?" she couldn't help but ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you want to know?" he stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only then did she realize that her words just now seemed like she was prying into his private affairs.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um, I...I was just asking casually. Sorry, I shouldn't have pried into your personal life," she quickly apologized.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm also not interested in sharing my personal life with unrelated people," he replied, turning his head to continue his experiment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, she quietly watched on the side, only realizing that it was already dark outside when the two of them left the laboratory.</p></div>
