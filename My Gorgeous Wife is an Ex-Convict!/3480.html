        <h1>Chapter 3478</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, a woman's coquettish voice came from Lionel's phone, "Hey, young man, come have a few more drinks. Later, do you want to try our new product here? It's guaranteed to be great!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sis...I...I want to go and try it out. Come on, hurry up and join me. I'm a good brother, right? I always think of you when I'm lucky..." Lionel finished speaking and didn't wait for Veronica to say anything else before ending the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica stared at her phone, feeling uneasy and unsure about what the "new product" she had just heard about on the phone really was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, this kid Lionel, it's too easy for him to learn bad things!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sorry, I need to go out for a bit," Veronica said to Jasper. "It seems like my younger brother has some trouble, and I need to go check on him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is something wrong? Do you need my help?" Mason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I'm just going to the nightclub to bring him back," even though it was afternoon, the nightclub was already open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me drive you there, my car is downstairs," Jasper offered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica thought for a moment and said, "Thank you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them drove to the nightclub, while on the other end of the phone, Lionel was sober and not as drunk as he sounded earlier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as the call ended, Lionel even had a smug smile on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mr. Barlow, is your sister really coming?" a young man next to him asked, clearly trying to please Lionel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, I deliberately let my sister hear those sounds on the phone. She must be worried. When she comes, we just need to pretend to kidnap her and then have Mason come to rescue her. By then, my sister and Mason will definitely make up," Lionel said proudly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had thought about this plan for several nights.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A fake kidnapping, let Mason be the hero to save the beauty. As long as they make up, even if they find out the kidnapping was fake, it doesn't matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Lionel, who was feeling proud, didn't notice the other young gangsters in the box exchanging glances and plotting against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica and Jasper arrived at the entrance of the nightclub. Veronica hurriedly walked towards the inside, and Jasper followed her into the nightclub.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the two of them entered Lionel's private room, they found that Lionel was the only one there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica asked in a curious tone, "Why are you the only one here?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Sis, I... I just called you to help you relax and take your mind off things. That's why I intentionally made this call, hoping you would come out! But, why is Jasper... um, also here?" Lionel was more surprised than Veronica, despite her strange behavior.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, with the sudden addition of a person, it's likely that the original plan will have to be changed somewhat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica will take you back, okay? Come back with us now," said Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Go back? How can we go back now? If we really go back, then his plan will be wasted, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um...hey sis, Jasper, did you come to find me? Are you thirsty?" Lionel said. "How about drinking a couple of glasses of water first?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, we didn't come here just to drink water. Come back with me!" Veronica said, reaching out to grab Lionel's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I spent a lot of money on this private room. There will also be singing and dancing performances later. How about we wait until after the performance before leaving? Sister, you haven't been in a good mood these days and I've been worried about you. I just hope you can be happier," Lionel said, trying to please her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica said, "Even if you want to make me happy, you shouldn't have lied to me and brought me to a nightclub!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lionel smiled apologetically and said, "I won't do it again next time. How about we go to a theme park or something for our next outing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper's eyes lit up at the suggestion, "That's a great idea. I'll bring my friend Mason along when the time comes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, yes, yes, call Mason!" said Lionel.</p></div>
