        <h1>Chapter 3383</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, suddenly, there was a noise coming from outside the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell's expression changed. It's so late, who could be coming here?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At least, he knew they wouldn't be his own parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the two of them want to come see him, they will probably inform him in advance as a matter of routine, and then choose a time that is visible to others to come here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For them, he is just the heir of the Quentin family, and that is essential!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But apart from this, there is nothing else, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One of the subordinates walked in and reported, "Young master, Mr. Hunter wishes to see you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">" Mr. Hunter?" Lornell furrowed,"Chandler?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let him come in," said Lornell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He doesn't have a particularly close relationship with Chandler, but they're not on bad terms either. Plus, Chandler is getting close with Tina, so maybe he knows something about Harley's situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although, if he really wants to know about Harley's situation, it's simple for him to just give orders to his subordinates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But he didn't want anyone to know that he cared about little Harley!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a moment, Chandler walked into the hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why are you here?" Lornell asked. Although he was only 7 years old, the Quentin family's education and environment had made his way of thinking, acting, and speaking more mature than ordinary children his age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Just checking on how you're doing," Chandler said. "You don't seem to have any major issues."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't," Lornell replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, I was wondering if you could help me save someone," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Save someone?" Lornell looked at him in confusion. It was rare for Chandler to ask for help, so it must be related to Tina, the person Chandler was destined to be with, as many people in the Crypt families knew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Not Tina, it's Harley," Chandler said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The Quentin family's medical skills were one of the reasons why they had a high status in the Crypt families.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">To Lornell, Chandler asking for his help must be related to Tina, but it turned out to be about Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell's expression changed suddenly. He had been looking extremely bored, but now he looked shocked. "Harley? What happened to her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She hasn't woken up yet," Chandler said. "The doctor said that if she doesn't wake up within 72 hours, it's very likely that she'll become a vegetable. It's already been 48 hours."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Harley doesn't wake up, Tina will feel guilty for the rest of her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he, unwilling to let this happen, so he came to find Lornell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Lornell is young, he is the heir of the Quentin family. Therefore, if Lornell is willing, he should be able to command the old monsters of the Quentin family to save Harley.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lornell never imagined that Harley's situation would be so severe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why is it that even though both of them were together at the time, one can wake up after being unconscious for a day, but Harley may become a vegetable?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How is that possible?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you think I would joke about something like this with you?" Chandler asked in response.</p></div>
