        <h1>Chapter 4395: The Talk of Others</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And as time goes by, the rumors about him are becoming more and more apparent.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even when he attended some social events, the way some directors, producers, and investors looked at him became increasingly blatant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And of course, Calvert knew exactly what such a blatant stare meant.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He's no longer a newbie in this circle. He understands the unspoken rules that operate behind the scenes.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He just never wanted to play by those rules.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Once upon a time, these people didn't dare to do anything because of his relationship with the eldest princess of the Hart family.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now, many people are spreading rumors that he's been dumped by the eldest princess of the Hart family. Naturally, these people wouldn't have any reservations anymore.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There's a social event tonight. It's about the lead role for the next drama. The investors and director will be there. You need to put on a good show. This is a big-budget movie. If you can land the lead role, it will be a huge boost for your future career!" the agent said to Calvert.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand," Calvert responded, his eyes slightly lowered.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But if... there's no chance for him to stand by Harley's side, then his career wouldn't seem so important to him anymore!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His life now is something he could never have imagined before!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if he does nothing in the future, the savings he has now are enough to sustain a normal life for a lifetime!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley never thought he'd run into Lornell at the charity event.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though she knew Lornell had returned to the country, she had mentally prepared herself for the possibility of running into him at any moment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when it really happened, it felt so sudden and unexpected.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Long time no see," Lornell greeted Harley.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, long time no see," Harley chuckled.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She and Lornell, they're not exactly friends now, but they're not enemies either. Yet, their relationship isn't quite like those who just nod in passing.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was abroad and heard that you and Calvert have been getting along well these past few years. He's been using your name to make a good name for himself in the entertainment industry. Even overseas, he has quite a few fans," Lornell said.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley frowned, "He didn't ride on my coattails. His success now is all due to his own hard work!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell scoffed, "Effort? Do you really think it's all about his effort? In the entertainment industry, mere effort is far from enough. There are countless people who work hard, but only a handful truly make it big. </span><span>More often than not</span><span>, it's about luck, and you, my friend, are Calvert's luck. Are you really content with being used like this?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's frown </span><span>deepened,</span><span> she didn't like hearing Lornell say things like this.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since when did you start caring about this? Whether he's using me or not, it's my business. Weren't you always indifferent to my affairs before?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell's face shifted slightly, "What if I want to care about your matters now?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean?" she asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I..." Lornell had just started to speak when a voice came from not far away.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Did you hear? Calvert was dumped by Harley!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you talking about that Calvert who models and acts?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it just him?!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Harley heard his and Calvert's names, he immediately showed a look of displeasure. Then he quickly pulled Lornell aside into a nearby corner.</span></p></div>
