        <h1>Chapter 258</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, many people in Emerald City now knew that Lily and Sean were engaged and would soon get married. Andrea Schwartz, when mentioning Sean, mentioned &lsquo;ex-boyfriend&rsquo; as if it was a conscious reminder of something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at Andrea, suddenly understanding something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a flash of discomfort in Andrea's face as Grace stared at her. She was looking at Andrea as though she could see right through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she told herself, &lsquo;So what if she can see through me? Grace is no longer the rising star in the industry.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had joined the firm together with Grace back then, but the person everybody laid eyes on was Grace only.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The colleagues in the office all used to say that Grace was going to be a big lawyer soon because she was doing great in her career and love life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Andrea made mistakes at work, her mentor in the firm would ask her to be more like Grace. This made her indignant, but she was helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was like a mountain on her head. As long as Grace was in the firm, the others would always compare both of them who were in the same batch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She, in turn, would forever live in Grace's shadow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, when Grace had her accident, Andrea was happy about it. She even thought that God was helping her by causing something to happen to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, after Grace went to prison, everybody stopped comparing her with Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace, don't mind about it. I just care about you. It must be hard being a sanitation service worker," Andrea said with fake sympathy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. It's not that hard," Grace said. At least being a sanitation service worker was a lot better than being in prison.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can it not be hard? As a sanitation service worker, you have to sweep the floor and tidy up rubbish bins every day. People say that sanitation service workers smell bad after being one for too long," Andrea said, obviously thinking that Grace was lying. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Andrea spoke, there was an unmistakable sense of disdain in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can stay away from me if you think I smell," Grace said bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea's expression stiffened before smiling. "We're colleagues. How can I despise you? By the way, you can come back to the law firm whenever you're free! Everybody misses you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea sounded as though she was making a passionate invitation, but in reality, the words struck a sharp blow at Grace's heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was her dream to become a lawyer, and when she realized it, she dreamt of a day when she could become a real virtuous lawyer in the legal field. She wanted to strive for justice in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, that dream had shattered long ago.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Andrea saw the faint flash in Grace's eyes and felt more energized. "By the way, I have a boyfriend now. He's a doctor, and he's out waiting for me. Shall I introduce him to you later?"</p></div>
