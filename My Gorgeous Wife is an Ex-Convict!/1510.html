        <h1>Chapter 1508</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Patrick added, "But we&rsquo;ve been trying our best not to mention Grace in front of Jason. Even though Jason seems to not have too many feelings for Grace now, he still dislikes other people mentioning her name."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"How could he just forget about Grace?!" Brian had a face of disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Patrick shrugged his shoulders and said, "Why not? She&rsquo;s just a woman. People like Jason can get himself any woman he wants. Hmm&hellip; but there isn't any other woman who can give birth to such a son."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Thinking of the boy in the Reed family made Patrick's body tremble. He was just five years old, yet had such high intelligence. He recalled all those times he interacted with that brat, which only left him feeling aggrieved, and it made him mad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Thank God he&rsquo;s not my son. If he were my son, I'm afraid I, as his father, would be controlled by him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It&rsquo;s only Jason who can make that brat obey him.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian's expression slowly became dark. 'Just a woman? But it was this woman who made Jason nearly go crazy. How could he just forget such a relationship?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian drank the wine in the glass in his hand. Then, he walked straight toward Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Hey, Brian!" Patrick could not help but call out to him. 'Is Brian planning to head over to Jason to talk about Grace?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Could it be that for the past five years, Brian&hellip; has never forgotten about Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The thought of it made Patrick quickly go forth. He was afraid that the place would be thrown into chaos if Brian brought up Grace&rsquo;s name to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, these two men nearly got into a fight because of Grace that year!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, Brian had already arrived before Jason. The few rich businessmen of Emerald City, who were initially having a conversation with Jason, immediately made a pathway when they saw Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, Brian was a big shot in the entertainment industry! He was also a powerful character in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I didn't expect to see you here. When did you return?" Jason smiled as if he was just greeting an old friend of his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's not a coincidence. I knew you&rsquo;d be joining tonight's banquet. Hence, I purposely came here to see you," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Oh?" Jason raised his brows. "See me? Do you need anything?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You&hellip; Do you still have any feelings for Grace?" Brian asked without beating around the bush.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The smile on Jason's face slowly faded. His dark eyes were staring straight at Brian who was in front of him. ''I don't think this issue has anything related to you, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I just want to find out whether or not you still have her in your heart?" Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The atmosphere at the scene suddenly became tense. The guests in the surroundings immediately distanced themselves from that area as they were hoping not to overhear their conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, compared to gossiping, they prioritized their lives more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If they overheard things that they were not supposed to, perhaps they might not be able to continue surviving in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason squinted his eyes and suddenly let out a soft chuckle. "I think you used to have a crush on her in the past too, right? What's wrong? Don't tell me that woman still holds a place in your heart?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Brian's expression changed for the worse. 'That woman&hellip; How dare Jason use such words to describe Grace?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'What the hell is going on here? Besides, why did Jason use the words 'I think'? Isn't Jason aware that it&rsquo;s a fact I used to have a crush on Grace?'</p></div>
