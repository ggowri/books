        <h1>Chapter 643</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could almost imagine how frightened the little boy felt back then when he stayed in this house. He was all alone. Even though he had family, he did not receive any affection and had to worry that he would be replaced by someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only by getting stronger could he not have the possibility of being &lsquo;weak&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was because &lsquo;weak&rsquo; meant he was likely to be abandoned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Was it... Hard?" Grace asked in a mutter, feeling sorry for the man in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Previously when she heard people talking about him, she just felt that such a superior man could have anything he wanted and could easily manipulate funds. Basically, he was a winner in life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now she realized that there was no such thing as a winner in life. The more glorious he was now, the harder he had worked for it back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At an early age, he was burdened with far more than a child should bear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right," replied Jason, his long fingers gently brushing past her caring almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes were now full of him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all over now. At least now I don't have to worry about anyone replacing me at will," said Jason. He controlled his own fate now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, it's all over," said Grace, gently pressing his hand and rubbing her cheek against it. "As far as I'm concerned, you can never be replaced."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His Grace always seemed to make him want to cherish her more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then never forget what you said," he whispered and bent down, kissing her lips lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only when the kiss was over did Grace veer back to the earlier question. "Do we just ignore your grandfather? Why don't I&hellip; Go see him?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she said this, her body trembled a little. It was false to say that she did not fear the old man. After all, their last encounter was truly frightening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. I told you, I'll marry you whether he agrees to it or not. If you meet him and he still doesn't agree with our marriage, will you not marry me?" said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought about it seriously and said, "No. As long as you'll have me, I'll marry you!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Therefore you don't have to care about whether he agrees or not. I'll marry you and you'll marry me," he said, not wanting her to see the old man.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because he was not sure what the old man would say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would be better if she was left in the dark about some things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two days later, Grace and Lina went to the bridal shop to meet the designer Grace had appointed in person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was Chinese, so they did not have much problem communicating.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The designer picked out a few wedding dresses that would suit Grace and asked Grace to try them on to get a feel for things before talking about the design.</p></div>
