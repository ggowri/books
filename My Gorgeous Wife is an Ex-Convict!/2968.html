        <h1>Chapter 2966</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright, not too bitter," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian then placed the cake and spoon in front of her before preparing his own meal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla watched from the side and suddenly felt that maybe Valda could really succeed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At this moment, Brian's gentle and considerate behavior towards Valda is not an act, but a natural and genuine gesture. When a man is gentle and considerate towards a woman without any ulterior motives, it can only mean that he genuinely cares for her and has feelings for her in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked at Brian who didn't add anything to his coffee and drank it as it is. She couldn't help but ask, "Don't you find it bitter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Fortunately, I usually drink coffee and I'm used to not adding anything," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson looked at Valda and Brian and suddenly asked, "Auntie Valda, Uncle Brian, when are you getting married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this question, Valda almost spewed out the coffee in her mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at Nelson and asked, "Why do you ask?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you two not on a date today? When a man and a woman go on a date, don't they plan on getting married in the future?" Nelson asked strangely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda was surprised and asked curiously, "How did you know we were on a date?" She didn't seem to have mentioned the word "date" from beginning to end, did she?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you not on a date? On TV, a man and a woman at an amusement park seem to be on a date," said Nelson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda is sweating profusely. Well, she underestimated the children a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When are you two getting married? If possible, please let me know half a year in advance, because if I want to buy you a wedding gift, I need to save some money to buy it," said Nelson seriously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda hesitated and said, "Um...we haven't yet..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," Brian interrupted Valda and said to Nelson, "I will notify you six months in advance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay then." Nelson lowered his head and resumed eating his cake.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda didn't know what to say, so she awkwardly changed the subject and asked Kyla, "Um... how much allowance do you give Nelson each month?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"About 200, so he can buy some small things he likes. But he's pretty thrifty, so he usually has some left over at the end of the month," Kyla replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">200 a month seemed like an average amount for a fifth-grade student.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that the child of a chairman of such a large corporation like Martin would only get 200 as allowance?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After leaving the amusement park, the two groups said goodbye and got into their respective cars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda said, "I didn't expect to see Kyla and them today. Kyla and her husband seem to have a good relationship, but her husband doesn't seem to talk much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda wasn't familiar with Martin and had limited knowledge of him. The first time she heard of him was when there were rumors online about Martin and Kyla getting divorced and Martin having an affair with another nurse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, she thought Kyla's marriage was in trouble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now, it seems like everything is fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sometimes, others may not be able to tell whether emotions are good or bad," Brian said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Does this mean that their relationship isn't good now?" Valda asked in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's something only they know," said Brian. "But I'm not interested in their business. Valda, if you have some free time, why don't you think about us instead?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's between us?" Valda blinked her eyes, looking confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Now that we're back together, when do you plan on meeting my parents?" Brian asked. "Otherwise, they might keep trying to find someone for me to marry and have children with."</p></div>
