        <h1>Chapter 3675</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Roger entered the living room, everyone else stopped talking and looked straight at him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, everyone who came here today is a familiar face, and only Roger is a stranger to everyone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But even though he's a stranger, because of the years of searching, everyone is quite familiar with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Grace had already seen Roger's photo before, and when she saw him, she greeted him, "Lawrence, you're here!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hello, Mrs. Reed," Roger greeted politely, "But now I go by Roger, please don't call me by my old name anymore."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay, Roger," Grace replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Jason also walked over, "Today is Jasmine's birthday, feel free to mingle with everyone here, many of whom you've met before when you were with the Reed family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So Roger greeted everyone in the room. When he was with the Reed family before, he had indeed met many of them, but at that time he was more shy and always hid behind Jasper, rather than facing everyone alone like he is now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After greeting everyone one by one, Roger finally came to Jasper, William, and Jasmine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You're here," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I said I would come and bring Jasmine a gift," Roger said, taking out a box and handing it to Jasmine, "This is for you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasmine took the box, but instead of opening it immediately, she looked at Roger curiously, "Are you Lawrence's brother?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger smiled faintly, "I used to be, but now I go by Roger. You can call me Roger brother."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that your new name?" Jasmine asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, my new name."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you for the gift, Roger brother!" Jasmine politely said, with a smile on her little face, "You're still alive, it's really great. Sister has always had Mom and Dad look for you. She has always believed that you're still alive!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Upon hearing this, Roger responded calmly, "Is that so?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, I remember one time someone asked my sister to give up on finding you, but she argued with that person and even cried under the covers!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper was embarrassed by his sister's big mouth and said, "Jasmine, who told you to say that?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't lie," Jasmine confidently replied, "At that time, sister, you were crying so sadly and even holding a photo of brother Roger!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper became even more embarrassed!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger's gaze fell on Jasper's face. Did she cry for him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, isn't it your birthday today? We're about to cut the cake soon," Jasper quickly changed the subject.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..." Jasmine hesitated, "Veronica hasn't come yet. She said she would come when she last saw me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Veronica's name was mentioned by Jasmine, Mason, who was standing nearby, stiffened slightly. His hand hanging by his side also moved imperceptibly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as it was almost time to cut the cake, Veronica finally arrived. She was wearing simple clothes and looked apologetically at everyone in the living room, "I'm sorry...I'm late."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No worries, you're just in time. We're about to cut the cake," Grace greeted her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Veronica, come here!" Jasper said, pulling Veronica to her side. At this moment, Mason stood next to Jasper.</span></p></div>
