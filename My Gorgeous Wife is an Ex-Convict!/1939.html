        <h1>Chapter 1937</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Why does she influence my mood so easily?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson gasped deeply. Then, he closed his eyes and mumbled, "Does she really love me just because she said so? Perhaps all she wants is a legitimate identity for the child."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina got back to the hotel, where Mr. Sweeney and Mrs. Sweeney were waiting anxiously. When they saw that their daughter had returned, they hurriedly went over and asked, "How was it? Hadwin..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina said, "He still won't forgive me or accept me. But I won't give up. I'll go look for him again tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mr. Sweeney sighed, while Mrs. Sweeney looked at her daughter sadly. "But if he keeps refusing to accept you, then you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She comforted her mother, saying, "Mom, don't worry. I'm not going to go after him shamelessly, take things too hard, or do anything extreme. If Hadwin still won't accept me after I&rsquo;ve tried everything, then... Then I'll go back to Emerald City with you and be a single mother. I'll stay with you and the baby for the rest of my life."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nonsense. Do you really want to be a single mother all your life? You can get married if you find someone else. Many women with kids still get married these days!" said Mrs. Sweeney, not wanting her daughter to spend her life like that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina smiled bitterly. After falling in love with a man like Hadwin Stephenson and experiencing being loved by him, how could she love another man?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She would never experience something so unforgettable again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, Mom. We'll talk about it later." Not wanting to worry her mother too much, Lina changed the subject.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The next day, Lina went to Stephenson Group again after breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The security guard hurriedly stopped her when he saw her. After all, he was scolded for not stopping the woman in time yesterday. If he let the woman harass the president again, he would probably lose his job.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'm... here to see your president," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Just go. Even if you know the president, it&rsquo;s clear he doesn&rsquo;t want to see you. Or you can set an appointment with the president, then we can let you in," said the security guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina looked troubled. She had called Hadwin Stephenson, but she kept getting a busy signal. She wondered if Hadwin Stephenson had blocked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Glaring at the &lsquo;devoted&rsquo; security guard in front of her, Lina could not help frowning and thinking about countermeasures.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson saw Lina enjoying a drink and some snacks on the couch outside the president's office after the early morning company meeting was over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He immediately stopped walking, and surprise flashed across his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What is she doing here?" Hadwin Stephenson asked the secretary with an indifferent expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The secretary said in frustration, "Uh, President, your... ex-girlfriend said she left something in your possession when she broke up with you. She said she'll call the police if you don't return it, so... I just let her wait here."</p></div>
