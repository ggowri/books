        <h1>Chapter 588</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian looked at Evelyn coldly. Fair? Was there ever justice in the world? If success was proportional to effort, he should have already found the little girl he spent so many years looking for!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However... He had not!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if that person never existed in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However... That person existed!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you want it to be fair, your mother slapped Grace, so let's be fair and slap you too," Brian said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evelyn, Melinda Riley, and Tony Cummins immediately froze at this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Melinda Riley sprang from her chair, screaming, "Why should I slap my daughter? You can't do that even if you're rich and powerful!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You can't hit your daughter?" Brian laughed as if he had heard a joke. "But you can casually slap your stepdaughter who isn&rsquo;t related to you by blood, is that right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There was a flash of embarrassment on Melinda Riley's face. However, she then argued. "How&hellip; How is it casual... It was Grace who shamelessly sabotaged your relationship with Evelyn..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, before she finished, Brian's face darkened little by little. The next moment, Brian's bodyguard had slapped Melinda Riley in the mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Poor Melinda Riley had just had her tooth knocked out by Jason a few days ago. She had not replaced her tooth yet and was already slapped again. She immediately cried out in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I hear you say something about Grace again, then your mouth need say no more."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian finished talking. As if he was no longer interested in staying here, he stood up to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evelyn screamed, "You can't do this to me, Brian!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian glanced at her lightly. "You should be glad that your lips look like hers. Otherwise, I won&rsquo;t be so kind to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With that, he left and was followed by several of his men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There were only three of the Cummins family members left in the meeting room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Melinda Riley covered her mouth which was stinging from the slap. She ran to her daughter in a daze. "What shall we do, Evelyn? What... Shall we do in the future? Are you going to be... Blacklisted? Are we leaving Emerald City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tony Cummins seemed to have come to his senses. He immediately said, "What about the penalty if all your work is stopped? How much will they cost? Does that mean we won&rsquo;t gain anything?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Evelyn shivered. Was it only because of Grace that Brian was being so ruthless to her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was even more ridiculous was that Brian's &lsquo;kindness&rsquo; came from the fact that her lips look like Grace's! This was the ultimate irony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she was going to have a hard time, she would not let Grace do any better!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">All of Evelyn's jobs had been suspended, and it was reported that the entertainment industry blacklisted Evelyn for allegedly offending Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, the nosy netizens started to cite the blacklisted actresses among Brian's ex-girlfriends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then, someone commented that being Brian's girlfriend was also a high-risk job. It seemed to be glamorous with many benefits, but they had to face the possibility of being blacklisted too.</p></div>
