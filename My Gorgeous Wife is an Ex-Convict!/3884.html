        <h1>Chapter 3882</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Congratulations." Mick, who had been silent all along, said to Mason and Veronica, "Do you have any specific wedding gifts in mind? If not, I'll prepare something myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah, thank you," Veronica said, but the conversation seemed to be moving a bit too fast for her to think about wedding gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Big brother, it's up to you for the wedding gift," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Mick nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace cleared her throat and smiled at Veronica. "When did you find out you were pregnant?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A week ago, but at that time we weren't sure if the fetus was healthy, so I only told everyone today after receiving the report on the fetal sac and heartbeat," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, about 6 weeks pregnant?" Grace estimated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," Veronica confirmed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Although two months is a bit rushed to prepare for a wedding, it's not impossible. You can ask for whatever kind of wedding you want, and if you have any requirements for getting married, feel free to speak up," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Auntie Grace, I don't have any requirements. I just want to marry Mason and safely give birth to this baby. That's enough for me," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You...don't know how to fight for yourself?" Grace sighed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've already given me so much, I don't need to fight for anything," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace looked at Veronica. Over the years, she had treated Veronica as her own daughter, and she still remembered how young Veronica had protected Mason before he was officially recognized as part of the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Without that protection, Mason, who had not yet returned to the Reed family at the time, would have suffered even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, I'm glad you chose Mason and became my daughter-in-law. From now on, this place will be your true home," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica's nose felt sour, and she felt a warm sensation in her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing their meal, Grace and Jason went into the study. Grace asked, "Why didn't you say anything at the dinner table just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I already said it. They're getting married, and I have no objections. I'm also looking forward to the birth of their child," Jason replied. "What about you? Aren't you happy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace was taken aback. As a couple for many years, only he could see her true emotions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not unhappy. Veronica and Mason have been through so much, and now they're getting married and having a child. Of course, I'm happy. But I'm also worried. After all, they're still too young," Grace said. "Veronica is only 20 years old, and Mason is 18. Many people at this age are still children themselves, but now they have to be parents. I'm worried that they won't be able to adapt."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, many things, such as lifestyle, will change when a child is born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She has encountered many cases where people have experienced severe mental changes due to the unexpected arrival of a child, leading to various mental illnesses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If they really can't adapt, we can naturally help them adapt. Besides, it seems that they are both looking forward to marriage and this child," Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's easy to say, but..."</p></div>
