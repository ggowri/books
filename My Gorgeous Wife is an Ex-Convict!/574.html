        <h1>Chapter 573</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina let out a hollow laugh. "Hehe..." That was the reason why people could not lie. If one told a lie, he or she would be caught easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin once again turned his gaze to Grace. "Hello. Sorry if this girl has given you trouble today. Are you done? If you're done, why don't we have a meal together?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I have other things to do. Just eat with Lina," said Grace. She did not want to be the third wheel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take you home then," said Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. I can just take the subway in front of the cinema. There won&rsquo;t be any traffic jams," Grace said as she bid farewell to Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Grace left, Hadwin folded his arms in front of his chest and stared at Lina with a half-smile. "I think you should explain to me what happened today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said rather lamely, "Well, I was tired from working overtime, so I came here to relax with Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" He grunted, making it clear that he did not believe her explanation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, what brought you here?" She asked as she began to change the subject. Additionally, when the question escaped her mouth, she realized that she was really confused. When she saw him, he was walking with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you think?" He looked at her disgruntledly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it had not been because of this woman, he would not have thought about asking Brian for some posters and autographs of Howell Webb after seeing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, posters that showed the muscles of his upper body were excluded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian happened to be there for some business, and Howell Webb had a roadshow there that day. Thus, he merely came along.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Who would have thought that of all the people, he would see the little liar there?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, looking at the rolls of paper in her hand that were clearly posters, Hadwin only found it setting his teeth on edge.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It seemed like she could get what she wanted without his help after all. Besides, it was unknown whether there were any muscle-baring posters among the posters she had!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina blinked her eyes. "You're not here to get Howell Webb's autograph and posters for me, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Exactly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in the face of her blank stare, those words of admission somehow became stuck in his throat.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In her heart, she thought of him only as a man bent on revenge and did not believe that he would treat her well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course not," Hadwin's voice turned colder by a few degrees.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I knew it!' thought Lina. However, it was unknown why there was a faint feeling of disappointment in her heart. What was wrong with her? What was there for her to be disappointed over? Hadwin did not like her fangirling over celebrities. Did she expect Hadwin&rsquo;s help with that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina bit her lip and her stomach wailed untimely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin glanced at her. "Are you hungry?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes..." she said rather lamely. She had screamed her heart out in the movie roadshow earlier, of course, she had burned herself out rather quickly.</p></div>
