        <h1>Chapter 138</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sean knows that I'm with Grace but Zoe was the one who exposed my identity at the worst possible time.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"The Stevens family sure is..." He ordered Terrence, "Bring Zoe to the hospital."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Yes," Terrence said and he continued to speak on another issue. "I've looked into the reporter who sneaked into the hospital the last time. The news of Mr. Reed bringing Miss Cummins into the hospital was first published by a nurse onto her Facebook Moments and it was then uploaded onto the internet. Although all relevant content has been deleted, we are unable to determine how many people have already seen it."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Look into that nurse's legal liability and strengthen the security around the hospital. I don't want someone to barge into the ward," Jason ordered coldly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I understand. Nothing like that will happen," Terrence said assuredly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Meanwhile, at the Stevens family residence.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Ever since Zoe had inadvertently blurted out the secret in front of Lina, she had been in a state of extreme anxiety. "Had I known earlier, I wouldn't have bothered Lina. Now I'm the one who's scared.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"If Lina figures something out and tells Grace of the incident...</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"My leg was broken as punishment for the last incident and it still hasn't healed. I really don't know what punishment I'll get this time."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Zoe, what's wrong? Why are you so restless? Did you stir up trouble?" Sean could not help asking as he studied his younger sister who was pacing around the living room, with her leg bandaged and leaning against her cane.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Their parents had gone to pay a visit to their friends and he had wanted to go with them but Zoe had asked him to stay with her at home.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Big Brother." Zoe suddenly spoke up after seemingly making up her mind. "Please help me! The other day, I carelessly blurted out the fact that Jason and Grace were together."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"What?!" Sean jumped up from the sofa. "Who did you tell?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"It was Grace's friend. Her name was Lina or something! I don't even know if she told Grace. But if Grace told Jason, would he find and punish me?" Zoe asked uneasily.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Sean's face was already as pale as a sheet. Just then, a servant came to report that the personal secretary of the Reed family had requested a meeting between Zoe and Mr. Reed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The siblings exchanged a look and they could see the fear in each other's eyes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Who would dare to refuse Jason's request to meet?!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The Stevens siblings got into the car apprehensively. When they arrived at the hospital, Sean was stopped outside the ward and Terrence ushered only Zoe into the room.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Not even the rich can afford to stay in such a luxurious VIP room." Zoe stared at Grace, who was dressed in a hospital gown and was lying in the bed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I couldn't stay in such a VIP room when my leg was broken but Grace gets to stay here!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But... Grace is sick?! I wonder what illness she has.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I hope that her illness gets worse!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the next moment, however, Zoe froze because it was then that she noticed Jason sitting on the sofa by the bed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He wore a white jumper with a pair of beige trousers, making him seem languid yet sexy. "A man like Jason is the dream of every young lady of note in Emerald City. However, they are some who intentionally got close to Jason and came to no good end. Therefore, the ladies of note love and fear him."</p></div>
