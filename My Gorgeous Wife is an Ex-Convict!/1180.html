        <h1>Chapter 1179</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some passersby around them looked over curiously due to the commotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason did not even cast her a glance and only walked toward the waiting car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Out of the corner of her eyes, the woman suddenly caught sight of Grace and immediately rushed toward her. "Miss Cummins, please help me out. Didn't you want to help me last time? Please, ask Mr. Reed to let me go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Things were happening all too quickly. Before Grace knew it, the woman was already in front of her in the blink of an eye. Her fingers were all wrapped in white gauze, catching everyone&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman's forehead was red and swollen, oozing with blood. There was a look of frantic pleading on her face. It was as if she would desperately cling to anything that would save her from this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I shouldn't have tried to take advantage of your experience that day. I shouldn't have put on a show and pretended to have my nails pulled out to attract Mr. Reed's attention, but I've gotten my punishment! I've already had my nails pulled out, so I've been through that pain!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman grabbed Grace's wrist firmly, regardless of the wounds on her fingers. "Miss Cummins, please take pity on me and plead with Mr. Reed. Please ask him to let me go!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Little did she know that all that she had carefully planned did not do her any good but only brought her to complete ruin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not only did Mr. Lee, whom she had asked for help, wanted to get even with her, but even her relatives and friends had severed ties with her after knowing she had offended Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace then realized that the woman in front of her was the waitress whom Jason protected in Tianxiang Pavilion's private room that night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She remembered that a man named Mr. Lee was having a conflict with the waitress and wanted to pull her nails out, and now... the waitress was telling her that everything had... just been for show?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman wanted to approach Jason, so she ganged up with Mr. Lee to put on a show?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked up and stared blankly at Jason who was not far away. 'Did he know that they were putting on a show? Did I look like a fool when I rushed out like that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt the urge to laugh bitterly. "I can't help you plead with him. You've got the wrong person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How&rsquo;s that possible? Miss Cummins, weren't you with Mr. Reed? I heard you were going to get married. Mr. Reed even specially ordered a Frozen Heart diamond..." she said quickly. She had also heard this by chance from a big shot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, she would not have decided to use Grace's experience to attract Jason's attention!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately froze. 'Frozen Heart...' How long had it been since she had heard the name? She had only seen the diamond and never even saw it on the ring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had broken up with Jason before she could see it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman's voice was not soft when she said all this. Of course, Jason heard her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason's face immediately darkened, while Terrence felt a thump in his heart and had a bad feeling about it!</p></div>
