        <h1>Chapter 771</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I do," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart seemed to be instantly enveloped in something. Her nose suddenly felt sore, and even her eyes became misty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out there was somebody in this world who would feel hurt because of her injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would feel her pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Falling in love with him might have been the best choice she ever made.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wrapped the towel around her body, carried her out of the bathtub, and helped her change into clean leisurewear. Then, he carried her out of the bathroom and treated her bruises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just yell if it hurts," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He treated her bruises gently as if he was dealing with a treasure of great importance&mdash;one that was even more important than his own life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he finally finished treating the ring of bruises around her wrist, he did not let go. Instead, he kept staring at the unfaded bruise around her wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Tell me. What did Brian say when he put you down and grabbed your hand?" His voice whispered out of his mouth, and his deep eyes slowly looked up into her almond-shaped eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened, feeling as though his eyes were trying to see right through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason has always been insecure in this relationship. Even though I've explained it to him, does he still have doubts and mind it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian said luckily, I'm not," taking a deep breath, she answered him truthfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Luckily you're not?" His eyes narrowed slightly as if pondering the meaning of this remark.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because... Didn't Brian always think I might be the one he was looking for? However, he found her now. It's... Stella. Therefore, I think he meant to say that he won&rsquo;t misunderstand me anymore. I'm not the one he's looking for."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace spoke. Her heart was beating violently when she said these words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she said was true, but now that she had recovered her lost childhood memories, she felt guilty when she said it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes were still fixed on her, and he raised his hand to stroke her cheek. "What about you? Do you regret it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cold voice seemed to hammer every word into the depths of her soul.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Regret? Regret that Brian made a mistake? Regret that partners who went through a life or death incident together couldn't recognize each other in the end?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She probably regretted it, but she knew what was most important to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have no regrets," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is that so?" He lowered his eyes gently, his lashes concealing the gloom that flashed in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If there's no regret, why did... she hesitate for so long?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She and Brian&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He got up and put away the ointment. "You're probably hungry. I'll get the servant to prepare some food."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace just realized she was hungry. It was almost after eight o&rsquo;clock at night and she had not had anything to eat since lunch.</p></div>
