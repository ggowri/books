        <h1>Chapter 2354</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was the only one in the empty ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was still a little stunned, not expecting that things would take such a turn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss... agreed to let Jacqueline Bowman off on probation in exchange for... a period of real married life with her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss's goal must be to prove that... there was nothing special about being a real married couple with her. Kyla smiled bitterly. It would be nice. At least... she got to spend more time with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps their married life during this time would become her most precious memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Martin Weiss returned to the Weiss family&rsquo;s house, Mrs. Weiss was still awake. When she saw her son return, she immediately asked, "Why did you come home so late? I almost thought..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss paused and did not continue, but Martin Weiss said," What did you think? Did you think I'd go back to Emerald City with Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss smiled awkwardly as she tried hard to persuade him, saying, "Martin, Kyla has now returned to Emerald City, so leave her alone. I'll find you any woman you want. If you like Kyla's looks, I can find you someone who looks similar to her." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, Kyla didn't return to Emerald City today. She's now in the hospital. Her belly was hurting today, so I sent her to the hospital. She'll probably have to stay in the hospital for a few days before getting discharged," said Martin Weiss. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss was shocked to hear that. However, what her son said next shocked her even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When Kyla is discharged in a few days, I'll have someone send her back to Emerald City. I&rsquo;ll wrap up my affairs here and go to Emerald City too. I&rsquo;ve agreed to her request of letting Jacqueline Bowman off on probation but at the cost of... being a real married couple with me in the one year after the baby is born. We'll get a divorce when the time is up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss froze for quite some time before saying," Why... Why would you let yourself get entangled with her? A real married couple? It's only for a little over a year. Do you call that a real married couple?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom, I've made up my mind!" said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when he was about to walk upstairs, Mrs. Weiss suddenly grabbed her son's arm. "Martin, can't you get over her? Is that why you want to be with her in this way?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss turned to look at his mother. "Mom, I&rsquo;m doing this to get over her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pried his mother's hand away and walked upstairs after he was done talking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss stood still in a daze. After a long pause, she said with a sigh, "Are you doing it to get over her? I'm just scared it'll be harder for you to get over her when the time comes!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Three days later, Kyla was discharged from the hospital, and Martin Weiss sent Mallory Malcom to escort Kyla back to Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can take the high-speed train back alone. You don't have to drive me back," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mallory Malcom smiled. "It's Chairman Weiss's order. He cares about you, Mrs. Weiss. I'm just doing what I was told. Just get in the car, Mrs. Weiss."</p></div>
