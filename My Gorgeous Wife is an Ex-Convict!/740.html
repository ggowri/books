        <h1>Chapter 739</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hands were in his. Their small and large hands stood out in contrast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hands were beautiful, from the shape of the fingers, length, to the joints and nails&ndash;They all looked so beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the contrary, some joints of her hand looked a little unnatural, and two joints were particularly prominent. They looked just like hands that had done laborious work for many years. If one were to look closely, they could see some scars on the skin of her hands&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hands like that seemed very ugly when it was next to his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Holding my hand like that..." Grace bit her lip slightly and tried to pull her hand back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he stopped her. "From now on, anything you can't do with your hands, I'll do for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was shocked, and then after seeing the guilt on his face, she seemed to realize something. She smiled gently and said, "It has nothing to do with you that my hands are faulty. You don't need to feel guilty."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at the smile on her face with a mixed look in his eyes. Grace was probably smiling like that to make him feel less guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, her words &lsquo;it has nothing to do with you&rsquo; was like a knife that struck him hard in the heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How could the things that happened to her have nothing to do with me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'If it had not been for my acquiescence, perhaps her hands would still be intact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I&rsquo;ll probably carry this guilt with me my whole life!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;ll certainly seek the best doctor and cure your hand thoroughly," he said, promising her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right," replied Grace. She did not expect her hand to be completely cured. She just did not want him to feel guilty anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, after the treatments and medication during this time, her hand was much better than when she just got out of prison. At least now there was less pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lowered his head and kissed her fingers deeply. He kissed the deformed joints and the places where there were scars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The scattered kisses seemed to warm her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stared at the man in front of her. She thought it would be the greatest joy for her to be loved by him all her life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Lily stared at her agent in disbelief, almost feeling that she had just heard something wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her manager said with a reluctant face, "Well... Now they&rsquo;re demanding to drop several commercial deals that we've negotiated, even if they have to pay the damages for breach of contract. That TV show you starred in that was going to be on TV has also been canceled. It might not even be released online."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How can it be?" Lily's face took on a ghastly expression.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I asked the two films you were interested in working with today, and they told me that you won&rsquo;t be considered for the current cast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides that, all those TV dramas and commercials you starred in before are now gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s now impossible to find any film or television works related to you on the internet. All of them are deleted. Even the relevant videos of your variety show episodes are gone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Bad news after bad news from her manager made Lily's face grow paler and paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What the hell is going on? How did this happen?" barked Lily. There was nothing gentle and noble in her face, unlike how she usually looked when she was putting on a pretense. There was only ferociousness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Someone wants to blacklist you in the entertainment industry, which is why..." stammered the manager. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Blacklist?" Lily felt as if she had just heard a joke. She was the second daughter of the Atkinson family and also the Stevens family's future daughter-in-law. With the Atkinson family and Stevens family backing her up, who dared to blacklist her?</p></div>
