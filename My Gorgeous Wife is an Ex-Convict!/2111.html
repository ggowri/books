        <h1>Chapter 2109</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Really? Forgive..." muttered Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, women relent easily," the photographer said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss's eyes glimmered slightly, and he said nothing more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew the old Kyla would relent easily. If she was angry with him, he had only had to coax her a little for everything to be fine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, now she could relent to everyone but him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss walked out of tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau and looked down at the marriage license in his hand. No matter what, she was now his wife and he was her husband!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Kyla returned to the store, Mrs. Corbyn saw that her daughter was alone and Martin Weiss was not with her. She asked, "Where's Martin Weiss? Have you gotten your marriage license?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, we got it. We separated at tMason Swansonvil Affairs Bureau's entrance, and I took the bus back myself," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She did not tell anyone that she was getting the marriage license today. She only told her mother last night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn asked, "He didn't bring you home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Why should he? We agreed that everything would remain the same after we got married. We'll leave each other alone and live our own lives. But we'll cooperate when it comes to things related to the kids," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn could not say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she wanted her daughter to be with Martin Weiss. After all, they had two children together now. She had also seen what Martin Weiss had done over the years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla felt nauseous again as she spoke, so she rushed to the side and threw up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn could only feel sorry for her daughter when she saw that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the afternoon, the sound of firecrackers rang at the end of the alley. Then, a line of luxury cars drove straight up and stopped at Kyla's store.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The neighbors looked this way as they were attracted by the sound of the firecrackers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss got out of the car in a crisp suit. Many of his men got out too. They opened the car trunk and took out bags of wedding candies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla gaped at the scene in front of her. She rushed to Martin Weiss after some time and whispered, "What... What are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss said, "I'm here to tell people we're married, of course. Aren't you afraid that Nelson, your mother, and the baby in your belly will be judged in the future? Then this is a good time to tell the people around us that we're married so that they&rsquo;ll stop talking about it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was speechless. When he made such a grand gesture, they would probably talk about him instead of their bastard children!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With that said, Martin Weiss ordered his men to distribute those wedding candies to the neighbors.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The wedding candies Martin Weiss prepared were of high quality, of course. They cost hundreds of dollars a box.</p></div>
