        <h1>Chapter 1941</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He resisted almost instinctively, not even wanting to hear it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson ignored Lina, opened the file on his desk, and dealt with work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina sat on the couch and put the snacks on the coffee table. She also poured a glass of warm water for herself at the water dispenser. She looked through some infant care-related web pages on her phone while eating the snacks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if they were strangely comfortable with each other, and everything was so natural.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Out of the corners of her eyes, Lina secretly glanced at Hadwin Stephenson, who was working. This moment felt like they were back in the old days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Whenever she came to see him back then, she would be eating and drinking on the couch in his office while he was busy with work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His office was always full of snacks she liked to eat, so much so that she later complained, "Look, I've gained weight. You put so many snacks around the office to tempt me. I'm going to be fat sooner or later."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What does that matter? I love you even if you're fat," he said with a smile on his lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, five years later, she was not fat and there were no more snacks for her in his office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was looking through infant care websites on her phone at first, but her phone camera was now secretly aimed at Hadwin Stephenson as she could not help but take photo after photo of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even if she could not be with him in the future, these photos could be keepsakes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the secretary walked into the president's office after knocking on the door, they saw their boss standing beside the couch with a phone in his hand while Lina was lying on the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina's body was covered with a thin blanket.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"President, here's the report you asked for." The secretary respectfully handed the document to Hadwin Stephenson. Out of the corners of their eyes, they caught a glimpse of the phone screen. It was a photo of the president.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can go," Hadwin Stephenson said to the secretary. Just as the secretary turned to leave, he said, "Don&rsquo;t make a noise when you close the door.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, after saying that, a look of annoyance appeared on Hadwin Stephenson's face as if he should not have said that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The secretary cautiously walked out of the office and closed the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Hadwin Stephenson's gaze fell on the phone in his hand again. It was Lina's phone, but it contained a lot of his photos. Some were even photos she had secretly taken while he was working just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Many of the photos were from five years ago when they were madly in love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Looking at these photos, Hadwin Stephenson fell into a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When Lina woke up, Hadwin Stephenson was looking at the project report his secretary gave him earlier. Lina was freezing when she suddenly felt the thin blanket on her. Then, a happy expression came over her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Hadwin must have put it over me.' She had just wanted to lie down on the couch but fell asleep while looking at his photos.</p></div>
