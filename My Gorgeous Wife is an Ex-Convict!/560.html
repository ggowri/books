        <h1>Chapter 559</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, her cheeks were red while her eyes were half-squinted. Her head rested on his shoulder, and the car seemed to smell of alcohol.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was drunk, but he was still sober.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes he wished he could get drunk as easily as she could. Maybe he would not think so much when he was drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, his body froze because a hand began to touch his chest slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was still restless when she was drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you know what you're doing, Lina?" asked Hadwin. However, as soon as he said it, he laughed at himself again. Why was he asking questions to a drunk woman? She probably did not even know what he was asking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she replied, "Yes, I... I'm touching you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Great, she was aware. He sneered. "Aren't you afraid you'll wake up and regret it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he was only talking about it. He was a little reluctant to pull the hand away from his chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, she ignored him and went on, muttering something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a while, she lifted her head slightly, trying to straighten herself up. "Hadwin, I... I'll tell you a secret..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his eyebrows. Secret? What secret could she have when she was drunk?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Get... Get closer&hellip; Secrets are to be told in the ear..." she stammered as her two eyebrows knitted together as if she was dissatisfied with the distance between them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He pursed his lips as he looked at her deeply, then he leaned forward to bring his ears close to her lips. The combination of alcohol and her scent smelled good to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had always hated women who smelled of alcohol and thought it smelled bad, but she seemed to be an exception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was then and it still was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her lips accidentally touched his earlobe, causing him to tremble a little. He heard her mumbling, "Actually... I think you have a better figure&hellip; Than... Than Howell Webb... He&hellip; He's no match for you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heartbeat seemed to have suddenly become rapid and loud. Besides her voice in his ear, he could hear the beating of his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Besides...Hadwin ... I... I like you, I really do..." She went on, and at the end of her sentence, she gave him a silly smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He fell into a trance as he saw her silly smile. There were too many women with a more flirtatious and lovelier smile than hers, but he seemed to be mesmerized by her idiotic silly smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, his heart beat like a drum!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina woke up the next morning with nothing but pain in her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'God, it&rsquo;s so painful. I should have known better than to drink! I always get a headache the next day when I drink too much!'</p></div>
