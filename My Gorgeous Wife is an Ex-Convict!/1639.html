        <h1>Chapter 1637</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Isn't this just what you wanted? You bribed that verified account, those reporters, and hired an army of internet trolls. You probably spent a lot of money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson felt a thump in her heart. 'He knows!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Katherine Jackson, aren't you just trying to force me to make a choice? I&rsquo;ve made my choice now," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson gritted her teeth in hatred, knowing that the man before her had seen through all her actions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Yes, she wanted to use such a way to test the man. She deliberately devised a plan to put Lina in trouble. She wanted Lina to become the target of public criticism and let everyone condemn her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She wanted Hadwin Stephenson to disassociate himself from Lina in public. Only in this way could she marry him with peace of mind!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she did not expect him to choose Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you know the consequences of making such a choice? Are you going to turn against the Jackson family? Don't forget who made you who you are today!" threatened Katherine Jackson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson looked down at the cocktail in his hand. It was Lina's favorite drink. She always said it tasted faintly refreshing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had drunk this cocktail countless times over the years! He wanted to personally make one for Lina to see if he was <span>&#8203;&#8203;</span>any better than he was five years ago. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson said, "You want to turn the Jackson family against the Stephenson family, don't you? Why else would you have me make such a choice? I know better than anyone who made me who I am today. Similarly, I&rsquo;ve not forgotten what the Jackson family did five years ago."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson trembled as panic flashed through her eyes. She told herself, 'No, he doesn't know about it!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If he really knew, how could he have done nothing for five years?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But if he had really endured it for five years, then this man... is truly frightening!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson did not look up at her until he finished his glass of cocktail. "Didn't the Jackson family, my mother, and my two brothers join hands to push me to the edge five years ago?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Katherine Jackson roared, "What are you talking about? It was the Jackson family and me who rescued you five years ago! Without the Jackson family and me, Lina would have been dead and you would've gone into hiding somewhere!" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Didn't the Jackson family plan this all along? My two brothers are already married and have children. Even if one of them were to divorce and marry you, you probably would've been unwilling. I'm unmarried and childless, so I was naturally the best choice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hadwin Stephenson spoke slowly. The Jackson family thought only they knew about their scheme, but so did he.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"The Jackson family was only waiting to give me a hand when I was in trouble. I could only rely on the Jackson family if I wanted to turn the tables. Everything would work out then. What a good plan that would make me grateful to the Jackson family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It's all just your speculation." Katherine Jackson tried hard to suppress her panic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Speculation? Isn't the Jackson family planning to take over the Stephenson family through the wedding? Do I need to be more specific about the Jackson family's plot?" asked Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You..." Surprise flashed across Katherine Jackson's eyes. She did not expect Hadwin Stephenson to know so much. She was scared now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Yes, she was scared. For five years, she thought she had this man under her control. Although he had no feelings for her, she never doubted that she could conquer this man one day!</p></div>
