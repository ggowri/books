        <h1>Chapter 3175</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's face darkened, and a hint of anger appeared in his eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, you can try and see if you can ruin it, and then see what kind of ending you will have." Brian's face was as cold as ice, and even his voice was extremely cold.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian!" Valda quickly pulled Brian's sleeve. "It's okay, don't mind what he says. He can't ruin our relationship!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda then turned to Raymond and said, "Whether or not I have a limp leg, it's not an obstacle between Brian and me. I will be with Brian. Mr. Bowman, I hope you don't come to disturb me anymore. I'm living well now, and I don't want to mention the past grievances anymore. Let it go with the wind. I've said all I need to say, please leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Raymond looked at Brian, then turned to Valda. "Do you really think the future will be as you wish?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No one can know what the future holds, but I will work hard to make my life as I want it to be," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Raymond's hand, hanging at his side, tightened. This woman in front of him was no longer the weak person who used to just nod and endure when bullied by others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, even with a limp, she radiated a certain brightness from within.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly had a feeling that this woman, who used to only look up to him in secret, would eventually become someone he would need to look up to, but could never touch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He had really missed his chance!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps he would regret it for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aren't you leaving yet?" the cold voice rang out again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Raymond looked at Brian, but ultimately didn't say anything and turned to leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There seemed to be no need to say anything more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda turned to look at Brian, but saw that his face remained cold and expressionless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Are you angry?" She raised her hand and gently stroked his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He raised his hand and grabbed hers. "What's going on with Raymond coming to find you? What did he say to you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's nothing really, he just wanted to know that I'm alive and came to check on me," Valda said. "I don't know why he suddenly showed up at my studio, but I don't think he'll come again after today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian furrowed his brow, "Did he not say anything else after that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"There are some other things too," she said truthfully, not wanting to hide anything from Brian. "He said that if he hadn't taken advantage of me in the beginning, we might not be like this now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian's face turned pale suddenly and he grabbed Valda's waist tightly. "And what about you? Do you also think he's right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda felt like he was embracing her so tightly that she was almost completely embedded in his arms, with their bodies pressed together so tightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I didn't think what he said was right, even though I had a crush on him before, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she finished speaking, he lowered his head and passionately kissed her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This kiss was much more intense than usual, as if it had a strong desire and possessiveness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She passively endured his kiss, her legs weakened, and if it weren't for his hand supporting her waist, she would have fallen to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she was almost out of breath from the kiss, it finally ended. Valda gasped for air, but then her body stiffened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His lips trailed along her cheek and landed on her slender neck, planting kisses as if he wanted to leave a mark on her body.</p></div>
