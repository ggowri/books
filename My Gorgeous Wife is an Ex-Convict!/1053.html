        <h1>Chapter 1052</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, according to her research, Martin Weiss had always been proud and arrogant. She just hoped it would make a difference.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Otherwise, she could only ask Hadwin Stephenson to find a new job for Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Grace turned to leave. Martin Weiss turned his head to look at Paisley Daniels who was beside him. "Why did you do that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels paled, and she bit her red lip before saying, "I just... wanted to help you. You want to win custody so badly. If... If Kyla Corbyn doesn't have enough income, the court... wouldn't award her the custody."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pressed his thin lips together tightly, his deep black eyes staring darkly at Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels felt guilty. It was as if he was going to see through her. She did not send people to give Kyla Corbyn trouble because of Nelson&rsquo;s custody. She just wanted to vent her anger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, Martin suddenly left the party because of Kyla Corbyn and that b*stard child when they were about to announce their wedding date, making her tMason Swansonty's laughing stock!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't ever do that again. Stay out of the custody case!" Martin Weiss said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels gave a soft reply, and a look of regret came over her face. "Martin, I'm sorry. I was just trying to help you. I didn't expect you to hate it so much... I'll do what you ask and won't do it again. Don't be mad, alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Seeing Paisley Daniels's behavior, Martin Weiss sighed lightly. "I'm not mad."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? I... I thought you were mad at me because of Kyla Corbyn. I'm worried you still have feelings for her," said Paisley Daniels as she tugged at Martin Weiss's arm as if she was afraid of losing him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn's face once again flashed across Martin Weiss's mind. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought of her crying in front of him, saying that even in hell, they would never meet again! The way she jabbed the broken glass into her stomach, and... the way she anxiously begged him not to fight for Nelson's custody with a pale face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why do I feel a dull pain in my heart whenever I think of these?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Feelings? I&rsquo;ve never even fallen for that woman. How could I have feelings for her? I was only nice to her to get revenge.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person he was supposed to take revenge on was Kyla Corbyn's father, but her father had already died, so he took his revenge on her instead!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he would not have any feelings for Kyla Corbyn at all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're overthinking. Don't ever think like that again. You're the only one I love," Martin Weiss said quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A smile appeared on Paisley Daniels's face. She lowered her head gently to lean on Martin Weiss's shoulder and whispered, "Martin, I love you. I love you so much. I would do anything for you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, I'll do anything, including eliminating Kyla Corbyn from your heart!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The man I want must only think of me! There must be no other women!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had completed her mission to the gala today, so she planned to bid Lina goodbye before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she found her best friend, Lina was looking at a popular male celebrity in the entertainment industry with bright eyes. She seemed to be talking about something to him, while Hadwin Stephenson looked helpless and gloomy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could understand Hadwin Stephenson's mood, but... Lina was a fangirl. Since Hadwin Stephenson was the one who brought Lina here, he should have expected this.</p></div>
