        <h1>Chapter 2300</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out when one loved someone too deeply, one would be the only one in pain!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;I need to stop thinking about it. I'll lock up all my love for her from now on, leave her alone, and let her live her life as she wishes!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss slowly closed his eyes and emptied his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Secretary Wang gave a peculiar smile. "I never thought someone would want to change their memories. Some people want to remember a relationship forever, but some try their best to forget about it. Old Master, why do you think this man is so persistent on such useless feelings?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The air was silent, and no one answered him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace would come to the store to accompany Kyla whenever she was free recently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, did that Wu guy ever bother you again?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "He never came back. Grace, you don't have to accompany me all the time. I'm fine. You're missing work by coming here all the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright. I'm not missing much. Someone at the firm will take care of it," said Grace. After hesitating for a moment, she suddenly said, &ldquo;Kyla, Martin Weiss has left Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's hand quivered slightly. The teapot she was holding to pour tea for Grace shook, and the contents spilled, splashing onto the back of Kyla's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was startled. She hurriedly took the teapot from Kyla's hands and put it down. Then, she nervously looked at Kyla's hand that was scalded red by the hot water. "Kyla, you scalded your hand. Quick, rinse it with the cold water!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla stood still blankly and did not move.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace immediately gripped Kyla's wrist, dragged Kyla to the sink, and turned on the faucet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Swoosh!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Cold running water washed the back of Kyla's red and swollen hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Kyla seemed to feel nothing. She did not feel the burn on the back of her hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her mind was haunted by what her best friend had just said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Martin Weiss... has left Emerald City? He left tMason Swansonty without telling me about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It&rsquo;ll probably be difficult for us to see each other again in the future. Just like that... one of us will be in the north while the other is in the south. We'll only be strangers!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt fits of pain in her heart. It was so uncomfortable!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I made the decision! Doesn't it make sense for him to leave Emerald City? But why do I still feel so devastated by the news?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla, you're so melodramatic!' she scolded herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When did he leave?" she asked in a murmur.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"He took a flight last night at 8 p.m.," said Grace, who heard about it from Jay.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss had chosen to leave Emerald City, which meant he had accepted Kyla's choice to separate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said nothing more and looked down as if pondering something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said nothing. She could not intervene in such matters.</p></div>
