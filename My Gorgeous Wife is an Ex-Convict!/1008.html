        <h1>Chapter 1007</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her heart felt like it had skipped a beat, and his eyes almost seemed to see right through her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian." Grace took a deep breath. This time, instead of calling him Mr. Hart, she said his name. "Yes, I do hope you won't fall in love with me. I just want to live a peaceful life and not play any more games."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said earnestly, "I've never thought of my love for you as a game. If you think I'm not serious enough, then tell me what I have to do to make you think I'm serious."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip slightly. "I'm tired. I really have no strength to love anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then I'll love you. You can love me when you have the strength. I just hope you'll stop rejecting me," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at him in confusion. "Why must it be me? I have no family background and was even imprisoned for three years. Besides, I'm not the one you were looking for."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she spoke the latter part with some guilt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, why must it be you?" murmured Brian as he lifted his finger and stroked her cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She made a conscious attempt to avoid his fingers but was startled by his gaze. His dark phoenix eyes were full of self-mockery and longing that could not dissolve.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"As you said, you have no family background and were even imprisoned for three years. You're also not the one I've been looking for. If I could choose who to fall in love with, then I indeed have many better choices than you. However..." His voice paused, and his fingers brushed softly between her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Since I still love you anyway, that means I love you for you and nothing else. You asked me why must it be you. I can't give you the reason. I only know that it would pain me to see you hurt, frighten me to find you missing, and terrify me when I know you might be in danger. Isn't that proof that I love you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace felt as though something was stuck in her throat. She did not know how to respond to his words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you really don't love Jason, can you give me a chance?" he muttered cautiously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace only then seemed to have come back to her senses. She took a step back and avoided his fingers. "But Brian, I won't fall in love with you, so there's no need for such a chance."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand felt somewhat empty. He closed his hand and laughed at himself. "Only you would refuse me again and again. Even if you don't love me now, how do you know you won't someday? Just as I never thought that one day, I would fall for a woman like you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was stunned. 'Is it possible... to fall in love with this man someday? However, why does Jason's face come to mind?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had chosen to conceal the fact that she was the little girl he had been looking for for Jason's sake, then she was now continuing to conceal the fact in hopes that he would not cling to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's Bryn, the boy who went through thick and thin with me when we were little. He's Bryn, the boy who kept a promise and searched for me for so many years.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she could not give him the love he wanted, she might as well continue keeping the lid on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If possible, she hoped he could find a woman who was worthy of his heart, instead of wasting his time on someone who was already scarred and could no longer love like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella reached the floor where the president's office was to see Brian. However, she was stopped by his secretary. "Miss Lindsay, President Hart isn't in his office right now. Please wait outside if you want to see him."</p></div>
