        <h1>Chapter 976</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was shocked, but then she found that it was Jason who was holding her in his arms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What... What are you doing here?" As soon as Grace said it, she realized that she had asked a silly question. She came to the police station with the two bodyguards he had sent to watch over her. They must have reported what happened to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don't want to see me?" Jason raised his hand and immediately brushed it across the spot where Brian had touched her just now as if to cover Brian's trace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace stiffened, Jason raised his eyes and looked at Brian. "I told you, you can't touch her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned slightly and raised his phoenix eyes slowly. "I must have her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This simple sentence was a sign of his determination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Impossible!" Jason said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's thin lips parted slowly. "It may have been impossible before, but since you&rsquo;ve broken up with her, then why is it impossible?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Grace, Brian said, "You don't need to give me an answer right away. Also, nothing I said today was meant as a joke. I can give you whatever Jason has to offer and the things that he can't!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That always delicate but indifferent face was now serious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace suddenly felt like she was in a trance. It was as if she was looking at the same little boy saying to her in a childlike voice, "I'm not joking. I'll come looking for you. I'll bring you to have a lot of fun and eat a lot of delicious food. I'll be very nice to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's enough!" Jason's low cry interrupted Grace's trance. Jason's face was dreadfully dark while his voice was cold when he said to Brian, "Brian, you'll never get the answer you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really?" Brian smirked. "Well, why don't we just wait and see?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men confronted each other again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The air around them became extremely tense.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the two bodyguards who watched over Grace had already finished giving their statements and came out of the room. When they saw Jason, they quickly stepped forward and said, "Master Reed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason pursed his thin lips, lowered his head again, and said to Grace who was in his arms, "Let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I..." Grace wanted to refuse to leave with Jason. As if he had read through her mind, he glanced faintly at Chase Harper who was standing nearby. "Do you want to leave with your former colleague?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace stiffened. She did not want to involve Chase Harper in this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She bit her lip a little and said to Chase Harper, "I gotta go now. I'll talk to Lawyer Carter about Baldwin's case and apply for the trial to be postponed. There's a good chance we can turn the tables."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, good..." Chase Harper said blankly. He was still a little shaken up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, what was happening felt unreal to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'The crown prince of the entertainment industry confessed that he loves Grace and... The man who called her &lsquo;Sis&rsquo; is different from the man I saw last time.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had the same face, but he was dressed differently. Besides, Brian had called the man &lsquo;Jason&rsquo; while the two men who came out of the interview room called him &lsquo;Master Reed.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A name loomed large in Chase Harper's mind.</p></div>
