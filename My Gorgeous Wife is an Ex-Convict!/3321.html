        <h1>Chapter 3319</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Lawrence suddenly looked at the child's watch on his wrist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That was given to him by Mr. Barlow, and it cost over ten thousand! His mother said that the watch is waterproof, so even if he wears it while diving, the watch won't break!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He suddenly pressed the button on his watch, which had a phone function. Inside, there was Jasper's phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If they just call Jasper, he will save their family, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Maybe Daddy and Mommy were just injured and there might still be hope. Mommy said that the Reed family is the most capable in Emerald City. As long as the Reed family wants to, there's nothing they can't do!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence called Jasper's phone, but no one answered on the other end!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And his gaze gradually became dimmer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The pleasure boat docked and everyone was waiting for the police to take the child to the station. However, Lawrence unexpectedly dashed off the boat, surprising everyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Due to the fact that the disembarkation point happened to be a busy pier located in tMason Swansonty center, a 10-year-old child disappeared in the crowd after running into it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Lawrence only wants to go to the Reed family and find Jasper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She has become his only hope now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Jasper is willing to help, maybe there's still hope for my parents. Mom said the Reed family is very wealthy, so if they can help him find good doctors to save my parents...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And so, Lawrence kept running until he reached the subway station.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his pocket, he had 20 dollars, which his dad gave him yesterday to buy cigarettes. But then his mom came back before he could leave, and they got into a fight, so he never went out to buy tMason Swansongarettes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence used the 20 dollars to buy a subway ticket from the self-service machine.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When the subway arrived at the station closest to the Reed family, he almost ran out as soon as the doors opened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His wrist, which had been cut, hurt a lot. Even though it had been bandaged, every step he took caused him pain. By the end, he felt like his hand was numb from the pain and he couldn't feel anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as he was gasping for breath and almost there, a car drove up from the other side and stopped at the Reed House's door. He saw Jasper getting out of the car, holding a phone and talking happily to someone on the other end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In an instant, Lawrence's footsteps stopped as he stared at the figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was on the phone with someone, which meant... she had seen his call, right?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But she didn't answer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she had said before, she didn't want to see him again in the future, so she didn't answer his phone calls.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... does she know how much he hopes she would answer that phone call?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If she agrees to answer the phone, then... does that mean his dad and mom...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as the Reed family entered the mansion, someone suddenly grabbed him from behind. When he turned around, he saw two men wearing police uniforms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One person is speaking into a walkie-talkie, saying "The child has been found, but their wrist is still bleeding. We need to take them to the hospital first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence didn't struggle, he just went along like a puppet as the two police officers took him to the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His wrist was cut and bleeding profusely, requiring immediate surgery. However, he remained silent and did not cry or express any pain while the doctor examined him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After finishing the inspection, he asked the police officer who brought him there, "How are my dad and mom doing?"</p></div>
