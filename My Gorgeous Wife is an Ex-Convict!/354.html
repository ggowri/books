        <h1>Chapter 353</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked just like a greedy piglet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was not sure which restaurant was good in the area, but this did not stop Lina from taking him to a restaurant she liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This restaurant serves some special dishes, some of which you can't find in other restaurants, only here." Once they were in the restaurant, Lina took the menu and began to order enthusiastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She started to introduce the dishes as she ordered. When she was halfway through, she found Hadwin staring at her gloomily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh. Sorry, I'm talking too much," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. You can continue, I'll just listen," Hadwin said lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina touched her nose but did not know what to say all of a sudden. "Well... Why are you here today?" she asked as she did not know what to say. However, she wanted to bite her tongue as soon as she said it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not easy for her to get past the blind date issue, and now, she was mentioning it herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, he looked at her and said, "If I hadn't come, would you have had dinner with that man?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her face was red from choking. "How&hellip; can that be?" However, she was a little guilty of her answer. After all, she had meant to invite him to dinner as an apology.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fortunately, that plan fell through. Thinking of the rude things the man had said to her, Lina suddenly felt a little regretful for not punching him just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since your family wants to set you up on a blind date, do they have any requirements for the suitor?" He seemed to ask casually.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Just the general requirements&mdash;owns a house, has a stable job, no less than 170cm in height, and so on," she said. She did not care if he owned a house, because it was all right for her to live in a rented house. Besides, they could pool their money to buy one after they got married.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, according to her mother's theory, with her age, she could still demand a man with his own house. If it was a few years later, she would not even have the right to demand so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina was also a little speechless at her mother's theory. She never thought a woman's age was so much of a problem. Many so-called leftover women still managed to find the love they wanted in the end, did they not?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she said so, her mother retorted, "That's because they have the money, looks, and education. What do you have?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Fine, it seemed that she was indeed her mother's daughter. "Well, at least I have a college degree and am not uneducated." She could not help but redress the injustice for her education.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"College students are now running all over the place. A billboard will be able to hit several college students if it fell. What's the use of your college degree? You could have gone abroad to study for a master's degree, but if it hadn't been for Grace, you wouldn't be a mere designer now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina knew her mother would always mention Grace when it came to this, but she did not regret it. Grace had been alone back then. If she had not come back, there would be no one left to help Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unfortunately, she did not help Grace win the case and ended up sending her to prison for three years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the thought of this, Lina's heart once again felt heavy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What are you thinking?" An elegant male voice rang in her ear, and Lina suddenly found that she got a little distracted with thoughts of Grace&rsquo;s case.</p></div>
