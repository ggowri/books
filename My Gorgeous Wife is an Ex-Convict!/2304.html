        <h1>Chapter 2302</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was not all-forgiving. Jacqueline Bowman framed her and even maliciously tried to get rid of the baby in her belly. She would not forgive her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even when Neal Reid heard Kyla's words from outside the door, he did not leave. He just said two words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">These two words made Kyla tremble on the spot. Her pupils could not help constricting, and she suddenly opened the door to glare at Neal Reid. She said, "How do you know Amber Mitchell? Did Jacqueline Bowman tell you about her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid immediately said, "Yeah, she told me. She said you have to see her at the detention center if you want to know about Amber Mitchell. She knows where Amber Mitchell is!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid did not know who Amber Mitchell was, but the look on Kyla's face and Jacqueline Bowman's confidence...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go look for her again. Just tell her I know where Amber Mitchell is. She'll come to see me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who is this Amber Mitchell?" he had asked curiously at the time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jacqueline Bowman only sneered as she looked at him. " Neal Reid, I want to get out of this place. What about you? If you want the Hunter family to steer clear from this, let's work together. You don't have to ask any other questions. You're no longer the man I used to need to cling to!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid hit a snag with Jacqueline Bowman, so he stopped inquiring.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was just passing a message anyway!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's expression changed, and she was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Neal Reid asked carefully, "Miss Corbyn, you'll... go, won't you? Jacqueline Bowman said you'll regret it if you don't. I heard that Amber Mitchell is pretty miserable right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla took a deep breath and looked at the person in front of her coldly. "Don't ever come here again. I'll go to the detention center, but what happens between Jacqueline Bowman and me is none of your business."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes, as long as you're willing to go! I won't disturb you again if you go to see her!" Neal Reid said and left immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn looked anxiously at her daughter. "Are you going to the detention center to see Jacqueline Bowman? She wants you to see her so badly. She must be up to no good and has an agenda!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, she has an agenda. But Mom... I have no choice," Kyla closed the door as she said to her mother, "Mom, didn't I tell you that I have a friend in prison who took good care of me and was released earlier than I was? I wanted to hide from Martin Weiss at the time, so she helped me hide my whereabouts and changed my profile so that Martin Weiss would have a hard time finding me after I was released."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After a pause, she said, "That person is Amber Mitchell. She has been a major help. It's a pity we lost contact afterward. Since Jacqueline Bowman knows Amber Mitchell's whereabouts, I must see her to find out where Amber Mitchell is."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially since she found out from Mr. Wu that Amber Mitchell was pretty miserable right now according to Jacqueline Bowman. Kyla felt a deep feeling of unease rising in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was a radiant woman. After getting released from prison, she remembered Amber Mitchell saying that she was doing pretty well! How miserable could she be now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"So that person is Amber Mitchell," muttered Mrs. Corbyn. She knew that someone had helped her daughter, but Kyla never told her the name. She did not ask further about it either.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she found out that the person's name was Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, Kyla went to the detention center to see Jacqueline Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Resentment flashed across Jacqueline Bowman's eyes as soon as she saw Kyla. Then, she suddenly chuckled. "Would it have been better if I hadn't met you at the Municipal Women's Hospital?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That way, she would still be Neal Reid's mistress. She would be trying to conceive a child and thinking of a way to make Neal Reid divorce his wife so that she could take over that position after getting pregnant. </p></div>
