        <h1>Chapter 3391</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As time passed by second by second, finally, when Harley slowly opened her eyes in the ICU ward, the people waiting outside were overjoyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"She's awake, she's awake! That's great, she finally woke up!" someone exclaimed excitedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda couldn't stop her tears from falling, her daughter had finally woken up! God knows how afraid she was that her daughter would never wake up again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, even Brian's eyes were filled with tears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Harley had woken up, she had only just woken up and fell asleep again after a moment of awakening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After the attending physician examined Harley, he finally announced that the little one was out of danger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This finally lifted the heavy stone in everyone's hearts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people then left one after another, agreeing to visit the little one again when her condition improved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Outside the ICU ward, it also became quiet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda sat on a chair, leaning against her husband's shoulder, quietly watching her daughter through the glass wall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These days, she has looked at her daughter countless times through this glass wall, but her mood has already changed completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, Harley has finally woken up," murmured Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yeah, she'll recover and before long, she'll be just like she was before," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Will she blame me? I didn't protect her well, but I also let her have another engagement. She's so young that she probably doesn't even understand what an engagement means," murmured Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Marriage, in fact, also means being tied down, especially for the Quentin family of the Crypt families. If they really want to refuse the marriage in the future, it won't be that simple!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, in that situation, she was unable to say no at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, Lornell proposed the engagement to save Harley. If it weren't for this engagement, why would the Quentin family have intervened?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Contradiction...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't know," Brian said. "Harley won't blame you. She's always been cheerful and optimistic. Besides, I think Lornell is a good kid. At least he genuinely wants to save Harley. Maybe the future of these two kids will be bright."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hopefully..." murmured Valda, unable to resist closing her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">These days, she has been too tired, and at this moment, the big stone in her heart has finally fallen, allowing her to truly relax.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In just a moment, Valda had already fallen asleep leaning on Brian's shoulder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian turned his head slightly and looked down at his wife beside him. He said softly, "Valda, don't worry. No matter what happens to our child in the future, I will protect you and our child. Even if something unfortunate happens, I will do my best to turn things around."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He will do everything in his power to protect his family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Lornell came to see Harley again, he was still being observed in the ICU, but he had been awake for quite some time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because of the limit on the number of people allowed in the ICU ward, and also because Lornell, despite being engaged to Harley, is not considered a family member in legal terms.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So he could only watch from the outside.</p></div>
