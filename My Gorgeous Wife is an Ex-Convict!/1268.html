        <h1>Chapter 1267</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian walked out of the lavishly decorated ballroom and did not look back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He wanted Stella to pay for her actions with the rest of her life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would have to live with it for the rest of his life as well!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;Reaping what he had sown&rsquo; was probably the best description!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His happiness in this life was over!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What happened at Stella's birthday party was trending online that night, including the video that was broadcasted exposing how she had deliberately framed Chase Harper. There was also a video of Brian coming and ordering people to strip Stella of her clothes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The rest of the footage was not shown, but it was enough to show that the woman who had been made a star in the entertainment industry by the crown prince was done for. Prosperity and wealth were all but gone for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, it was discovered that there was something even worse. Hart Group sued Stella for obtaining a large amount of money through fraudulent means.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This news seemed to make the public explode.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Fraud? Stella defrauded Brian?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, many netizens speculated about what had happened and how she defrauded him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did not have many emotions after reading the news online. Maybe she was already mentally prepared since explaining everything to Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How could someone like Brian allow others to cheat him?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A photo of Brian at the birthday party was trending online. It was obviously taken by a guest at the party.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the photo, Brian was thin and wearing a black windbreaker. He seemed to be filled with loneliness, and his handsome face was expressionless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found Brian unfamiliar when she saw him like this. In her opinion, though he would give people a sense of indifference and estrangement, he had never carried such a biting chill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Have you fallen into a trance by looking at Brian?" Jason's voice suddenly rang in Grace's ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She turned her head but did not expect him to bend over with his face close to hers as he looked at her. Her lips unintentionally touched his lips when she turned her head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was just a passing touch, but Grace's heart skipped a beat. She blushed as she said, "I just happened to... come across the trending post about Stella and him..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes seemed to grow darker under the lights. "Will you regret it?" he asked abruptly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" She was momentarily baffled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Regret that if you had told him earlier you were the one he was looking for, you might be living a different life now," muttered Jason.</p></div>
