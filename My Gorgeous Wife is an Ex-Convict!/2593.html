        <h1>Chapter 2591</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though his daddy had hurt his mommy deeply and he previously hated him, his heart was now filled with gratitude.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If his daddy had not given his mommy his liver, he would have lost her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla smiled. "Yeah, he's... a brave man."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew Martin Weiss had already prepared himself to die for her and the baby the moment she became pregnant and decided to give birth to their daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he went through hypnosis to forget his feelings for her afterward, he still made the same choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two days after making arrangements, Kyla took the high-speed train to L City with her suitcase in hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not have Martin Weiss's new phone number and could only call the lawyer. "I want to see Martin Weiss and talk to him personally about the divorce."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm afraid that's going to be an issue. Mr. Weiss is too busy with work to come to Emerald City," the lawyer said, feeling troubled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's fine. I'll go to L City. I'm already on the high-speed train to L City," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" The lawyer was shocked. "You're on the high-speed train to L City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I should be in L City in three hours if nothing goes wrong. If possible, I hope you can give me his contact information so that I can contact him myself," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I'm afraid that's inconvenient. How about this? I'll ask Mr. Weiss if he's willing to talk to you," the lawyer said and hurriedly ended the phone call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a long time before Kyla received another call from the lawyer. However, the lawyer said that Martin Weiss did not want to see her. He only intended to sign the divorce papers with her through the lawyer. Even if she were in L City, he would not see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Corbyn, why don't you return to Emerald City? Mr. Weiss said you're free to suggest any terms for the divorce papers," the lawyer said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, got it." Kyla ended the call with a bitter smile. Sure enough, he was unwilling to see her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does he think donating his liver to me a second time means a clean break for his feelings for me?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But I don't want that. I don't want things to end like this between us!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla dialed Grace's phone number. "Grace, do you know the exact address of Martin's mansion where he's recuperating?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace gave Kyla an address along with detailed coordinates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After that, Grace asked, "Are you going to L City?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm already on my way. I'll be there in three hours," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well... I wish you a pleasant journey. If you run into any trouble after getting there, call me," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, thanks." Kyla did not refuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would remember her best friend's kindness. She might never be able to repay her fully, but she would remember it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ending the call, Kyla took out the medicine she carried with her. There were three types of pills, making up a total of eight pills. She swallowed them with water one by one.</p></div>
