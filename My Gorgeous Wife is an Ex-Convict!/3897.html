        <h1>Chapter 3895</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Who are you to make me apologize? You're just as lowly as your mother..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you keep talking, I will attend the wedding whether you apologize or not!" The girl lifted her eyes and stared coldly at the other person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The other person hesitated, and finally managed to say, "I'm...I'm sorry! Okay, I apologized. Nancy Fowler, you better not go to the wedding, or you'll regret it!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After speaking, the other person hurriedly left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The girl who was slapped finally looked towards Mick, who was standing in a hidden corner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick stepped out of the shadows and asked, "Why didn't you ask for help when you were being slapped just now? After all, he saw you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy retorted, "Ask for help? Ask for help from you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"At least you could have tried," Mick said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"They say the Reed family's young master only cares about what interests him, and ignores everything else. I don't think you would be interested in what just happened," Nancy said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Do you know who I am?" Mick squinted his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, who at the wedding doesn't know the Reed family triplets? Besides, you're the best man today and you were with the groom welcoming guests earlier," Nancy replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Mick didn't have much of an impression of Nancy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During the welcome, he had forgotten many of the guests, especially the female ones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The wedding is about to start soon, are you going to stay here?" Nancy asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick checked the time and realized he should go, but... the swelling on the girl's face was a bit jarring to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about you? Are you going straight home instead of attending the wedding?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Home? Nancy's eyes dimmed. Her true home was long gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I'll stay here for a while before leaving." If she left now and was discovered, it would be embarrassing for her mother and stepfather.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So it was best to wait until the wedding officially started and then leave quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick remained silent, staring at the swelling on Nancy's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Aren't you leaving?" His direct gaze made her uncomfortable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I can have the Reed family doctor take a look at your injury." The wedding also had medical staff on hand in case of any emergencies.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick rarely cared about strangers' injuries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But the swelling on the girl's face made him curious, perhaps because she had calmly pretended nothing had happened after being slapped and meeting his gaze, without asking for help.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need," Nancy sneered lightly. "It will be fine in a couple of days, and there won't even be a trace left."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He furrowed his brows slightly. Her words made it seem like she had a lot of experience with this kind of thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, he couldn't stay here any longer. Mick didn't say anything else and turned to leave through the courtyard's exit.</p></div>
