        <h1>Chapter 2445</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But..." Even Captain Wang was starting to think that Amber Mitchell was not mentally ill.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No buts. I'm my sister's guardian. My sister has been viciously kidnapped, and I want to rescue her! TMason Swansonty's expert confirmed my sister's mental illness. How could it be otherwise just because others said so? Who's going to take responsibility when something happens?" Louise Mitchell yelled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just as Captain Wang was about to rush into the room where the doctor was diagnosing Amber Mitchell, a voice suddenly rang out. "That's enough. Let the doctor finish diagnosing Amber Mitchell."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Louise Mitchell was surprised as she looked at the person next to her in disbelief. The speaker was her husband, George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The others froze as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"George, what are you saying? We must take Sis away and end this joke!" Louise Mitchell whispered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory only looked straight at the huge electronic screen and looked at Amber Mitchell's eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes seemed to be brimming with heavy suffering, but they also seemed to have a touch of hope and... the last shred of trust.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could see that she cried for help because she trusted Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was unlike the other day when he went to the hospital to see Amber Mitchell. What was left in her eyes was hatred apart from numbness to pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know what I'm saying. And I wonder what her mental state is right now," replied George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell felt a pang in her heart, and a chill suddenly began to spread all over her body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He... has never gotten over Amber Mitchell! Otherwise, he wouldn't have said such a thing!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Amber Mitchell was diagnosed with no mental illness, did he know what would happen to the Mitchell family and her? </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, in front of so many people and the media, she could only maintain a semblance of composure. With a dry chuckle, she said, "Doesn't Sis have a doctor in charge of her mental health? The attending doctor will show you her medical records over the years. George, I don't want this farce to go on!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's eyes finally fell on Louise Mitchell, but his gaze made Louise Mitchell's heart sink even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, maybe it's time this farce ends," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's hands and feet went cold. 'He... He seems to be alluding to something. Could he have figured something out?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell wanted to continue whispering to George Gregory, but he looked away from her and turned to speak to the nearby Captain Wang, "Captain Wang, wait here until the evaluation is over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, okay!" Captain Wang said. He wanted to do that too, of course. After all, both parties were in conflict, and this case was not easy to handle with so many media outlets present.</p></div>
