        <h1>Chapter 3576</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His facial features were already three-dimensional, and if we were to distinguish between the so-called "thick makeup style" and "light makeup style" nowadays, he would belong to the former.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">With his deep-set eyes, straight nose bridge, and sexy thin lips, he gave people a strong visual impact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William greeted Jason and Grace again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As for this child whom they had watched grow up, the two naturally trusted William to take Jasper around the banquet hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the daughter has a somewhat unconventional personality, William's character is unusually mature for a young person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although it was a charity banquet, there were inevitably many people who approached the Reed family to chat. Jasper was impatient with this, so he pulled William to a less crowded area.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Would you like something to eat or drink? There's still some time before the auction later," William said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go pick something myself," Jasper said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the food side of the charity banquet, the food was laid out in a buffet style for people to help themselves.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As they approached the area where the food was placed, they saw a woman with heavy makeup and a luxurious dress casually picking up a glass of champagne and splashing it on the face of another woman who was dressed plainly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Jasper only saw the back of the woman at that moment, he could guess how embarrassed the woman who was splashed with champagne must have felt.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper took a closer look at the woman who splashed the champagne and recognized her as a popular actress named Mabel Holt. However, her fame did not come from her acting, but rather from the powerful background behind her. She debuted as a leading actress, and rumors had it that her background was not small.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, Jasper was not interested in the backgrounds of celebrities in the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, another woman in a fancy dress walked up and chuckled, "Oh, Miss Holt, I wonder how my assistant offended you to make you so angry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Jasper also recognized the woman speaking, who was also a female star named Angelica Kinsman. She has acted in many movies and TV shows, and apparently, she is currently competing with Mabel for the lead role in a movie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, Jasper knew all of this because of Tina's connections. Tina likes to follow celebrities, so sometimes when they meet up, she talks a lot about stars.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Angelica appeared, Mabel became even angrier. "Angelica, you did it on purpose, didn't you! You deliberately had your assistant spill wine on my dress just to make me look bad!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Angelica smiled slightly. "Miss Holt, you've got it wrong. How could I have my assistant do such a thing? But I did see Miss Holt herself not paying attention to her surroundings and bumping into my assistant, causing her to spill the wine on Miss Holt's dress. If Miss Holt doesn't believe me, she can ask the cameramen who were filming around us. Maybe one of them captured the scene just now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You--" Mabel glared at the other woman, her face turning red. Of course, she knew she had bumped into the assistant herself, but she was a famous star. The assistant should have avoided her, shouldn't she?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"This dress is Valentino's high-end custom-made. Miss. Holt probably borrowed it. Now that it's been splashed with red wine, the dress might be ruined. I wonder if Valentino will fully compensate Miss. Holt. If compensation is required, it would cost several million dollars." Angelica smiled lightly.</p></div>
