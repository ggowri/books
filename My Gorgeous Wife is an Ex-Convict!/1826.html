        <h1>Chapter 1824</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina comforted herself in her head, but the tears she had been suppressing the entire night still came pouring down in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'I... hadn't put in all my feelings. But can I really take them back?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'If that's true, then why am I in such pain right now? I can't stop crying at all!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Why is my heart throbbing so badly?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, would you believe me if I told you you're the one I&rsquo;ve always loved?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, give me some time. Just give me a little more time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina, how are you going to take responsibility for me?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Lina... Lina..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His voice and the words he had said to her kept ringing in her ears, but they seemed so far away to her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina finally started the car, turned the car around, and drove away from the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina knew she should drive her to the office. Today was not a rest day. She had to go to work.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She tried to gather her emotions together so that she would stop crying. If she kept on crying and her vision got blurry, she would not be able to see what was ahead of her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, an electric bike appeared in front of her car, trying to cut through the traffic.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina would have been quicker to react if it were any other day. However, she was stunned for about two seconds, and it was too late to hit the brakes. Therefore, Lina subconsciously turned the steering wheel, and the car immediately crashed into a tree.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The impact made Lina pass out. The airbags in the car deployed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The passersby immediately surrounded the car. Someone hurriedly opened the door, asking nervously, "Lina, Lina, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina unbuckled her seat belt with difficulty. She looked at the person. "Yu... Yulai, why are you..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I was passing by when I saw your car hit the tree, so I quickly stopped my car and came to check on you. How are you? Are you okay?" Anthony Sherman asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He happened to see her car on his way to work. Since he remembered her license plate number, he was sure it was her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew that this was not her usual route to work and wondered why she was driving by at this hour. Suddenly, he saw her hit the tree to avoid a swerving electric bike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I... I'm fine..." Before Lina could finish, there was suddenly a trace of pain in her belly and it slowly intensified.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Her hand pressed on her belly. 'The baby! Is my baby...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Ouch, my belly hurts..." Her face became paler and paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Anthony Sherman hurriedly carried Lina out of the car at the sight of this. "Hold on for a little while. I&rsquo;ll take you to the hospital right now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">As he spoke, he quickly carried her to his car and drove to the nearest hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina pressed her hands on her belly tightly as she clenched her teeth. Her fair forehead was already covered with sweat. Beads of sweat ran down her cheeks, making her all the paler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Anthony Sherman glanced at Lina out of the corners of his eyes and comforted her. "We'll arrive at the hospital soon. Don't worry. Your baby will be fine."</p></div>
