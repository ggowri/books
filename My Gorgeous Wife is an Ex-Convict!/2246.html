        <h1>Chapter 2244</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried to break away from his hand, but his five fingers were still tightly clasped around her arm. "It has nothing to do with the doctor. I insisted on having my blood drawn!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even if you insisted, the doctor should&rsquo;ve considered the limits of an average person&rsquo;s body&hellip;&rdquo; said Kyla as she raised her other hand, trying to pry open the five fingers clasped around her arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss suddenly staggered. He was a little shaky.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla suddenly paused and looked at him somewhat nervously. "What's the matter? Are you okay?" The way he looked reminded her of how weak he was in front of the store back then. It was as if he might fall at any moment. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I haven't had breakfast this morning, so I'm a little hungry." He gave a faint smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the smile made Kyla feel a pang of sadness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though Kyla did not understand why, she offered to accompany Martin Weiss to a restaurant near the hospital. She ordered something that was easy to digest and ate with Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss said, "You don&rsquo;t have to accompany me. Aren't you still waiting for your test results? They should be ready by now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The doctor will contact me if I haven&rsquo;t collected the reports or if there&rsquo;s bad news. Since nobody contacted me, everything should be fine, right?" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Then... Would you like me to go to another table? You're probably... feeling uncomfortable sharing a table with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He remembered her telling him that she was afraid of him. When he came near her, she could not help being afraid and recalling him having people pin her down on the operating table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, he could control all his desires and impulses for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not want her to be scared and remember those bad memories.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze a little. Watching Martin Weiss getting up to go to another table, she pressed her hand against his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not expect herself to do that either. Therefore, she froze for quite a while after doing that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss also looked at Kyla in shock, and excitement seemed to slightly light up his dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You don&rsquo;t have to go to another table," said Kyla after biting her lip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss froze for a while. He said with a faint sob in his voice, "Okay." Then, he began eating again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, Kyla said, "Stop getting your blood drawn, okay? It&rsquo;s too harmful to your body. If you keep insisting, I'll go straight to the doctor responsible for this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Martin Weiss looked up at the person in front of him. "Even if this hospital refuses to let me get my blood drawn anymore, I can always go to another hospital. I can also get a private doctor or nurse to draw my blood and store it. I can always find a way if I want to."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla glared at him. "Have you ever wondered what will happen to someone if they get their blood drawn so frequently?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss met her eyes. "Similarly, have you ever thought about how risky it is for you to give birth to this baby?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss continued saying, "If you can take such risks for the baby in your belly, why can't I take such risks for you?"</p></div>
