        <h1>Chapter 3120</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Amber probably won't be with him anymore," Valda murmured. "When she mentioned George before, there was no emotion in her eyes. It was as if George was just a stranger to her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In those eyes, there was no love, not even hatred remained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Perhaps this is the saddest thing of all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian suddenly hugged Valda and said, "Between us, it will never be like that, Valda. We will be fine and grow old together!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But... can it really be done like that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda leaned against Brian's chest, thinking to herself...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At night, Brian stayed at Valda's apartment as usual and slept on the couch. Valda, on the other hand, tossed and turned in her room, unable to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The words that Amber said to her during the day keep echoing in her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Is the "good" she chose really "good" for Brian? Or will it push both of them into a deep abyss of pain?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And in a few years, will she regret it? Would she be happy if she had been more courageous at that time?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, in another ordinary apartment room, Amber looked at her sleeping son and a smile appeared on her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She thought that she and her son would be strangers for the rest of their lives, believing that the Gregory family would not allow them to be reunited.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But a year ago, George came to Emerald City with his son, and since then, she has been able to see him more and more often.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">From the beginning, Simon was a bit reserved in front of her, but now he can call her "mommy" and they interact naturally. She really feels that it's enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her life, from now on, will be like this, and it's good.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She can live a good life, and this is also Herman's hope.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber lifted her hand and gently touched the ring hanging around her neck. It was... her wedding ring with Herman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Herman, let's wait for the next life. In the next life, I will definitely marry you again. But this time, I won't be marrying a memorial tablet, but the real you. We will be very happy then," Amber murmured softly. She then turned around, switched off the light in Simon's room, and walked to the living room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she sold her shares in the Mitchell Group for a large sum of money, she did not live a luxurious life with the money. Instead, she only bought a regular apartment in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For her now, material refinement is no longer important. She would rather take that money and use it to help people who need it, just like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Only in this way, it seems that her heart will be more at ease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber walked away from the bed and looked at the moonlight outside the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tonight's moon seems quite bright, and tomorrow... it should be a clear and sunny day.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as she was about to avert her gaze, her eyes unintentionally glanced downwards and caught sight of a figure standing beneath the apartment building.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That is George!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Amber was surprised to see George downstairs, and from the looks of it, he might have been standing there for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them locked eyes and stared at each other.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She didn't know why George was standing there like that, and even after their eyes met, she couldn't understand the excitement and anticipation on his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, what is there to be excited or hopeful about?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">There is no longer any possibility between them, is there?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Time and experience can truly change everything.</p></div>
