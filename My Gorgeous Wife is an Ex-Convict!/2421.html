        <h1>Chapter 2419</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla's hand could not help caressing Martin Weiss's face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He suddenly stiffened. The eyes he fixed on her darkened. "What are you doing?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She froze before reacting and jerking back her hand. "No, I just couldn't help myself..." With that said, she suddenly paused as if she was flustered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Gosh! What am I talking about?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He continued to help her put on her socks, but his eyes were staring at her intently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla felt her feet burning. She was almost unable to stand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When he finally put socks on both her feet and got up, she instinctively wanted to step back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had only taken a step back when his arm was already around her waist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You couldn't help yourself?" he murmured in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blushed and opened her mouth to say something, but she was at a loss for words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He narrowed his eyes slightly and raised his other hand to caress her red lips. "Kyla, you're no longer a young woman. You should know how easy it is to misunderstand what you just said."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Not only were her feet burning but her lips too. "I... I'm sorry..." she said awkwardly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sorry?" He sneered and looked at her with a complexity that even he did not understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said the so-called hypnosis was nothing but self-deception, and he would remember his feelings one day. There would be overwhelming pain by then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Self-deception? Will I... really remember the feelings I want to forget?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, you have no feelings for me, right? Why can't you help yourself? Are you trying to flirt with me? What are you up to?" he said as his face approached her suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared blankly at the face so close to hers. "I don't know what you mean."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said, "Do you want me to be more specific? Are you flirting with me so that I'll fall in love with you and help you do more? Is it to ensure you can smoothly rescue Amber Mitchell when the time comes? Or do you have anything else you want to use me for? Why don't you just say it? You don't have to act like you have any feelings for me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla instantly turned pale. 'Does he... think I have other intentions?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's... not the same man anymore.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to flirt with me, doing that isn't enough. You need to do more than that." When he finished speaking, his lips approached hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The tips of their noses were almost touching. They were so close that she could count his every eyelash.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tried to push him away, but one of his arms was wrapped firmly around her waist while the other grabbed her chin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? Are you trying to play hard to get? Other people may like it, but I don't," he said before kissing her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss seemed to prove that he was in control of their relationship. He felt nothing even if he kissed her like this, and the feelings he had forgotten showed no signs of coming back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He kissed her so domineeringly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla struggled hard, but her strength was no match for his.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kiss was not sweet to her. It was more like a humiliation.</p></div>
