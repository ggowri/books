        <h1>Chapter 422</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But, even if Brian wants to snatch you away, he can&rsquo;t, right? Because the person you like is me, and the person you are destined to fall in love with in the future is also me, right?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason murmured out loud with his warm breath that then brushed her face. As soon as his voice fell silent, a kiss also landed on her lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would never let anyone else have her, and she would only be his!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace woke up the next day, Jason had already gone to work. After Grace had her breakfast, she began to prepare lunch for Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lunch boxes and ingredients were readily available in the Reed Residence. Additionally, there was a chef nearby that had received instructions as well. If Grace were to face any difficulties or needed help, the chef would lend her a hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Jason&rsquo;s lunch boxes was made, Grace took a look at it and felt that her craftsmanship seemed to have improved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace brought the lunch boxes along and headed for the Reed Group. However, because she was sent there by the Reed family&rsquo;s driver that day, the security guard at the company&rsquo;s entrance was stunned when he saw it was Grace who got out of the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although not very few people in the company had spread information about the mysterious takeout rider, it was likely that she was not merely that. Otherwise, how could the rider have upgraded from a small electric bike to a private car so quickly!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Especially that car&hellip; Several security guards recognized that the vehicle belonged to the president&rsquo;s household!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Additionally, the driver was also the president&rsquo;s household&rsquo;s driver!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For her to be picked up by the president&rsquo;s driver&mdash;&mdash; No one would believe it if one said that nothing was going on between her and the president!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In fact, Grace was well-acquainted with the security guards. When she passed them, she even took the liberty to greet them first. &ldquo;Good afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Good&hellip; Afternoon&hellip;&rdquo; several of the guards replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took the lunch box and went up the lift to Jason&rsquo;s floor. No one on the floor was unaware of Grace&rsquo;s existence and most of them knew that although she looked like a takeout rider, the relationship she had with the president was not at all ordinary. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Uh, is Young Master Reed in the office?&rdquo; Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; a secretary replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then, is anyone in his office now?&rdquo; Grace asked to be on the safe side. After all, she did not want to bump into the top managers of the company inside his office. The scene would be all too embarrassing for her. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s no one else in Young Master Reed&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; the secretary replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only then did Grace walk toward Jason&rsquo;s office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After knocking on the door twice and pushed the door open, Grace saw Jason sitting at his desk. However, she then noticed that he seemed to be... conducting a video conference!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was flustered for a while. This was&hellip; well, he was alone, but he was in a meeting. The fortunate thing was that the camera was not facing her, and she did not need to worry about showing up on the screen. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here. Wait for a bit, the meeting will be over soon,&rdquo; Jason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Grace&rsquo;s reply was as quiet as a mouse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace walked toward the coffee table. However, just as she was about to place the lunch boxes on the table, she heard in the video conference say, &ldquo;Oh, Jason, is that the woman we saw during the last meeting?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;It could be someone else,&rdquo; said someone else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I haven&rsquo;t heard Jason speak in such a gentle tone to any other woman.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The people of the video conference conversed in English as they discussed whether or not she was the person that had shown her face in the meeting before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace&rsquo;s understanding of English was considerably fluent, so she could follow the conversation they were having.</p></div>
