        <h1>Chapter 2430</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, Mick Reed showed photos of the mansion to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at the mansion in the photo. 'Is Amber Mitchell locked in there? What&rsquo;s happening to Amber Mitchell?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help feeling emotional as she thought of the torture the once high-spirited heiress had suffered throughout the years. Perhaps Amber Mitchell's experience reminded her of her former self, so she felt more sympathy and empathy for the woman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car arrived at the location Brian had sent Grace, which was a cafe. Brian had already reserved a private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the three members of the Reed family entered the private room, Brian's eyes sparkled slightly. He did not seem surprised that Jason had come too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's been a while, Jason." Brian greeted first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I had hoped we wouldn&rsquo;t have to see each other,&rdquo; Jason said pointedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled faintly. "I'm sorry for letting you down."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two men looked at each other. Then, a childlike voice rang out. "Are you Uncle Brian, the one who has always liked Mommy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's eyes fell on Mick Reed's face that was similar to Jason's.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Looking at Mick Reed now reminded him of the time he saw Jason when he was a child. At the time, Jason was a little older than Mick Reed now. He was aloof and cold at parties, but his face would break into a nearly perfect smile when the adults approached him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that time, Brian had already thought that Jason was wearing a mask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He even wondered who would be the one to tear off his mask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He now knew that it was Grace. Jason would only present his genuine self to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," Brian replied to the little one.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Poor you. My mommy likes my daddy and not you," said Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Alright, Brian found that Jason's son was indeed as unlovable as Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked awkward and immediately changed the topic. "Is Amber Mitchell still in the mansion?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, she's still there. My source there says Amber Mitchell is being held in the mansion's basement. There are security guards at the mansion. I'm afraid it won&rsquo;t be easy to find a way to get her out in secret," Brian said as he instructed a computer expert nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The person turned on the computer and showed Jason and Grace the layout of the mansion, as well as the basement where Amber Mitchell was being held.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The computer expert also analyzed the Mitchell family's security measures. They had adopted an advanced security system.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if we call the police?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We don't have any photos of the Mitchell family abusing Amber Mitchell, and her guardian is the Mitchell family. Her family has the right to lock up a mental patient. The Mitchell family will have many reasons to explain their actions," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was silent.</p></div>
