        <h1>Chapter 2653</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She quickly whipped out her phone and dialed 110.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The kicks on the door got louder and louder as if it might break at any moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the same time, a man's gruff growling was heard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You dead b*tch, open the door. Do you think you can get away today?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm going to make you pay. I'm not only going to break your hands but also your legs. Let's see if you can run!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She soon got through to 110, and the operator's voice sounded. Valda Theller quickly asked for the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, the man's gruff voice came again. "What's the matter? Are you calling the police? I'm telling you, it's pointless even if you are! Let's see if the police will come before I kick down this door!&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was arrogant, even threatening Valda Theller when she was on the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller heard the door crack. Perhaps it would be kicked open soon. Even if she managed to call the police, she probably could not afford to wait for the police to get here. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a moment of despair, she heard the woman scream and then the man's chaotic shouts, which merged into a cacophony of voices. Then, there was silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked confused, not knowing what had happened outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, are you okay now? Please tell me your current address!" The operator's voice could still be heard from the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm at..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, are you in there?" Brian's voice came through the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oh, I... I'm here!" Valda Theller answered hurriedly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can come out now. It's over," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller looked surprised. 'It's over?' However, she found that the door had been kicked out of shape. She could not open it when she tried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I can't... I can't open the door," she said awkwardly, and the door had barely enough space at the top and bottom for anyone to get through.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then get back as far as you can!" Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller hurriedly obeyed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was a bang, and the door was kicked open. Valda Theller looked at Brian in shock. 'He... came to save me. He showed up when I was desperate.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hello, hello, are you still there? How are things on your side now?" The operator's voice came anxiously from the phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm... alright now," Valda Theller murmured as she ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you okay? Were you hurt?" Brian asked as he looked at the pale person with fear in her eyes. He could tell that she was in great shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'm fine. I have no... no injuries," Valda Theller stammered as she walked out of the cubicle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When she walked out, those who had wanted to hurt her were sprawled on the floor and wailing. The woman who had caused the trouble was now on the floor trembling with fear. The expression on her face could not be any ghastlier.</p></div>
