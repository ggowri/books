        <h1>Chapter 3777</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Veronica arrived at the door of her apartment and opened it, she was greeted by a soft light and the smell of food in the air. Then she heard a familiar voice say, "You're back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just a simple sentence, but it made her feel like tears were welling up. And when she saw that figure, she suddenly felt like her heart was settling down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That is... Mason, the person who has accompanied her for the longest time in her life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Hmm, I'm back," she raised her lips and smiled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The food is ready, wash your hands and we can eat," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," she replied, put down her bag, washed her hands, and came to the dining table.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>There were four dishes and a soup on the table, a bit more than what two people could eat, but it looked good!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica took out her phone and started taking pictures.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why are you taking pictures?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"This is the first meal you've cooked since we started dating. Of course, I have to take a picture to commemorate it," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you like the taste later, I can cook for you whenever you want," Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was taken aback. So, he meant that he could cook for her anytime she wanted?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew that now, just like before, he would agree to any request she made.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She sat down and </span><span>started</span><span> to eat the food.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The taste of the food was better than she had expected, and as a result, she ate half a bowl more than usual.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It seems that your cooking skills have really improved during your years abroad," Veronica said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Living alone, you always have to do something to pass the time," he said. If he didn't find something to distract himself, he wo</span><span>uld only think about those memories from the past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if the unforgettable feeling has faded away, the memories of those experiences remain vivid in the mind, especially without the emotional attachment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's true, living alone sometimes requires keeping oneself busy," Veronica murmured. Mason's words reminded her of her past.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When she first moved into this apartment alone, she used to overthink things and feel more pain and discomfort as a result.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only by keeping herself busy could she forget about those things.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what about Mason? Is he also doing it for the same reason?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking about this, Veronica looked at the person in front of her and suddenly asked, "Don't you blame me?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blame you for what?" he asked in return.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Blame me for misunderstanding you, not trusting you back then, even though you saved me when I was kidnapped," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I blame you and resent you, that's why I chose to be hypnotized," Mason replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I should be blamed and resented for misunderstanding and accusing you," she said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I blame and resent you not because of your misunderstanding and accusation," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked surprised, "Not because of that?" Then why?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I blame and resent you because if you can fall in love with someone, why can't that person be me? Why do you only see me as a little brother?" he said.</span></p></div>
