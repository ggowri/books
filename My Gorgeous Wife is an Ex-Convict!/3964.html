        <h1>Chapter 3962</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy stared at the person in front of her, her nose suddenly becoming sour, and a strange feeling surged up in her heart, making her feel confused.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Can it be? Can he really like her like this?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although she was full of calculations, he was so serious about his promises.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Nancy felt that she was despicable to the extreme.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The next day when she woke up, Mick had already left, but he sent bodyguards to stay in the hospital to guard her room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And on the note he left her, it said that he had some business to attend to at the company, but he would come back at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At night...looking at the note in her hand, Nancy suddenly felt a sense of anticipation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Sure enough, Mick came to her hospital room to keep her company at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at his figure standing in the room, Nancy felt warm in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this what it feels like to be protected?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Since her mother's death, the feeling of loneliness had faded away a lot because of Mick's presence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Nancy has been in the hospital for almost a week, and Mick has been staying overnight for a week as well.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When it was time for her to be discharged, Mick suggested, "Since you're just getting out of the hospital, why don't you come stay at my villa to rest? You'll have servants to take care of you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, thank you. My injuries aren't that serious, and they won't hinder my movements. I can take care of myself," she declined his offer.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Don't you want to move in with me?" Mick asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I-" Her words seemed to get stuck in her throat, unable to come out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How should she say it? Was it because she wasn't sure about their relationship? She felt like she was walking on a tightrope, ready to fall to the ground at any moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If she moved in with him now, she was afraid that her dependence on him would only grow deeper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you feel more comfortable in your rental, it's okay not to move in. Just let me know if you need anything, okay?" Mick's words relieved Nancy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After returning to her rental and after Mick left, Nancy went to her mother's memorial and prayed with her hands together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom... I survived this time, and Mick promised to make Clarissa pay for what she did. Your revenge is finally fulfilled. Clarissa will go to jail, even if the Schultz family has power, they will fall this time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As she spoke, Nancy's eyes became moist.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But... Mom, why am I still so sad? I used Mick's feelings for me to take revenge. I don't have any feelings for him, but I lied to him and said I liked him. Mom... What should I do? Should I confess to him? Will he forgive me?" Only her voice floated in the air, and everything else was silent.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The following days seemed to return to the days before Nancy was hospitalized. She worked at the hotel every day, met Mick for dinner after work, and then Mick would send her back to her rental.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On weekends, they would go out to watch a movie, go shopping, or stay in his villa to read books and watch TV shows.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days were like a dream.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In this dream, she often has the illusion that she is dating Mick.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Or rather, they are dating, but it feels like they are walking on a mirror that could collapse at any moment. Perhaps it will shatter completely in the next moment.</span></p></div>
