        <h1>Chapter 2273</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace nodded at that. "Okay, then!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Before leaving, Lina said to Kyla, "Kyla, call me and Grace if anything happens! Don't make yourself a stranger!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I won't." Kyla smiled gratefully, warmth welling up in her eyes again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that the police could find her so quickly this time because the Reed and Stephenson families had helped!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was great to have such friends!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Grace, Lina, Jason, and Hadwin Stephenson left the ward, Kyla looked at Martin Weiss and murmured, "Martin Weiss, do you know by doing this, you'll only make me owe you more and more? How am I supposed to repay you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Things were a mess between them, and every time she thought they were going to sort things out, they just got messier and messier.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The white gauze on his neck, chest, and hands stung her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps, it would never be even between her and Martin Weiss!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Mrs. Corbyn brought Nelson to the hospital, she saw her daughter sitting by Martin Weiss's bed in a daze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps Mrs. Corbyn already knew what had happened before she came, so she was not very surprised. All she felt was sorry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn looked blankly at Martin Weiss, who lay in a coma in a hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mommy, is Daddy unconscious because he's hurt ?" asked Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, Daddy had surgery, and it's gonna take some time before he wakes up," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why does Daddy have so many injuries? Were the bad guys tough?" asked Nelson Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla rubbed her son's head gently. "It wasn&rsquo;t that the bad guys were tough but your daddy was just too protective of me." He would not have been so seriously injured had it not been for this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nelson Corbyn looked intently at Martin Weiss after hearing that. Then, he hugged Kyla. "I want to grow up faster. I can protect Mommy and my sibling too once I grow up."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla wanted to say something, but Mrs. Corbyn interrupted by saying, "Alright, stop talking. Isn't your neck hurt too? Don't talk till you're better!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla had to stay in the hospital for observation for another two days because of her wounds. Due to her neck wounds, Kyla only had some porridge for dinner. Nelson Corbyn and Mrs. Corbyn only went home after seeing Kyla finish her dinner.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, before leaving, Nelson Corbyn ran to Martin Weiss's ward again to say goodbye to him, even though Martin Weiss was still in a coma.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Corbyn looked at her daughter. She had learned from the police what had happened during the rescue.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We owe it to Martin. If it weren&rsquo;t for him, you might have suffered even worse things. Even the baby in your belly wouldn't..." She was still frightened by what she had heard from the police.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the police had come a little later, her daughter would not be in front of her right now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," replied Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Think of it. Few people in this world are willing to do this for another person. He made a lot of mistakes, but... it should be enough now," muttered Mrs. Corbyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hated Martin Weiss too, but she felt more sympathy for him now.</p></div>
