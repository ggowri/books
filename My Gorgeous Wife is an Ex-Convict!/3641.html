        <h1>Chapter 3639</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This time, Roger admitted quite readily, "Of course, I know they are your grandparents. Is there a law that says I can't meet them?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you specifically go to Deer Capital to see them? Deer Capital is not close to Emerald City."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Just out of curiosity," Roger provided an answer. "I naturally read the post on the school forum about you, and then I curiously looked into the incident where your mother caused Mrs. Reed from the Reed family to go to prison. I found out that Lily's parents should still be alive, so I searched online for clues about them. With the advanced technology nowadays, I found a post online saying they were seen scavenging on the streets of Deer Capital. So, I went to Deer Capital and unexpectedly ran into them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, you sure have a lot of free time to specifically make a trip to Deer Capital just to meet two homeless elderly people," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I guess it's because I found it interesting," Roger said. "To ordinary people, you and Jasper should be sworn enemies, but instead, you two childhood sweethearts have become a couple. So, I became curious about your mother's family. Weren't they also involved in helping the villain and causing Mrs. Reed to go to prison?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's face grew darker, as every word from Roger felt like a reminder of the obstacles that should exist between him and Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Interesting? Do you find this to be an interesting matter?" William's voice was icy, for him, this was the root of his pain, but in the eyes of the person before him, it seemed like an amusing thing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Isn't it?" Roger retorted, "With a life experience like yours, full of ups and downs, there are probably not many like you in this world. You always seem to be lucky, even though your mother is a criminal, you still managed to find your biological father and become the heir of the Barlow family. Moreover, your relationship with the Reed family, who should have been enemies, is so close. I just wonder how long your luck will last."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No matter what you have in mind, I can tell you clearly that you won't get what you want in the end!" William took a step forward and grabbed the other person's collar.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so? Well, I'm looking forward to it then," Roger said lazily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The tension between the two was about to explode.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Jasper's voice rang out, "What are you two doing?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They turned their heads and saw Jasper walking towards them. William let go and said, "Nothing, just chatting casually."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked at the two suspiciously, then turned to William and said, "The gifts have been sorted out and it's getting late. Let's go back."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Okay," William replied.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the two were about to turn and leave, Roger suddenly spoke up from behind them, "William, aren't you going to the hospital to see your grandfather-in-law? His illness is not light, you might never see him again in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William's footsteps paused, and he coldly uttered, "To me, he is just Harold."</span></p></div>
