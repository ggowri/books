        <h1>Chapter 590</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason said, "Now that you've mentioned it, there's no harm in telling you." Even if he did not tell her now, she would know about it soon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, it was not really a secret in Emerald City's high society.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He might as well tell her himself rather than have someone else break the story to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian is indeed looking for someone. He&rsquo;s looking for a girl he knew when he was young, but he still hasn&rsquo;t found her. You can say that his girlfriends are substitutes for that girl. Since he can't find the right person, he finds replacements to comfort himself instead," Jason said as he watched Grace's reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help furrowing her brows. "He's looking for a substitute for a little girl?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"His ex-girlfriends look more or less like that little girl.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But they're not the one he's looking for. Is it fun to keep looking for substitutes?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe he's too obsessed with it, or maybe he&rsquo;s on the verge of despair. After all, maybe he doesn't even think he'll ever find that little girl again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Jason spoke, the conversation took another turn. "If you were that little girl and you knew there was such a person looking for you, what would you do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned for a moment. She had not thought about this assumption.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Will you be touched and go back to him?" asked Jason in a deeper voice than usual. It was as if his voice was inducing her with some sort of hypnosis to say what she really thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Probably not. Just like what you&rsquo;ve said, maybe he's too obsessed. He's not really in love with the little girl. Besides, he knew her when he was young. How deep can a child's feelings be?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Really? What if he's bent on having you?" asked Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace could not help laughing. "If he's bent on having me, must I give myself to him? Besides, I already have you. Even if I'm willing, you won't let me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, you already have me..." muttered Jason. "Of course, I won't. I won't give you to anyone."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand suddenly grabbed the back of her head. He kissed her on the lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The hot, lingering kiss was overbearing and monopolistic, almost leaving Grace breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not have a clue how much time had passed, but when the kiss was over, Grace's cheeks were flushed. Her chest was heaving, and her lips were opened slightly as if she had not come back to her senses yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason gently caressed her lip, his eyes flashing brightly. "Brian thinks he can get comfort from a substitute, but he's just deceiving himself. If it were me, I wouldn't be looking for a substitute. There's no point if the one beside me is not the one I want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace delivered the food in the afternoon, she again received an order from her former law firm. The order was placed by her former colleague, Andrea Schwartz.</p></div>
