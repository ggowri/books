        <h1>Chapter 242</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He made women have the illusion that they were being spoiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn took her sunglasses off and stared at Grace, her eyes almost ready to burst into flames. "Grace, Brian is mine!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then you should say this in front of Brian, not in front of me," Grace said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You..." Evelyn groaned before finally turning and walking away quickly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Since she could not get anything from Grace, there was no point in wasting her time, but... She wanted Grace to pay for what she said today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What did she mean by how long can she be Brian's girlfriend? She would be Brian's last girlfriend!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She would not give Brian up to anyone else for the world!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Later that night, Grace received a Messenger message from the organizer to go over to the film set from last time on her day off this week.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;The director said there were a few shots of you last time, and you did a good job. The last scene involving the extras was not filmed at all. However, it will be filmed the day after tomorrow. It will be the same crew of extras from last time so that it&rsquo;s not confusing.&rsquo; Sidney, the organizer, also left her a message explaining everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace hesitated before replying, &lsquo;Alright, got it.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, she had already filmed it the last time. It would not be right for her to ditch this time. Besides, she was introduced by Claire. If she refused to go, it may cause some unnecessary trouble for Claire.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who is it from?" A voice sounded behind her. Grace turned her head abruptly and realized that Jason had walked into the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only, he did not enter through the door that connected the two rooms but through the very door of the room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just promised to be an extra again this week," Grace said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Are you going to be an extra again?" He said, frowning, &ldquo;Haven't you had enough of the last lesson?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace pressed her lips and said, "If you want to make money, there's no way you won't suffer." Besides, once she completed this filming, she would try to avoid film crews involving Evelyn next time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A light flickered in his eyes. "That being said, you don't care if you suffer as long as someone gives you money?" he asked, leaning on the edge of the bed with his hands as he bent down and looked straight into her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was startled. Her back was subconsciously pressing back, trying to distance herself a little from him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the more she did so, the closer he came to her. His extremely beautiful, amorous eyes were beautiful, but people could not look through them. It was as if there was a cloud of smoke over his gaze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Is that correct, Sis?" he muttered, his breath going over her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was lost in thought and suddenly lost her strength. Her back suddenly stuck to the bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, he was already lying on top of her. "So you won&rsquo;t care if I give you money and you have to suffer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's face turned a little red. "I... only earn what I deserve!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He chuckled and rubbed his finger against her red lips. "Don&rsquo;t you deserve the money I give you?"</p></div>
