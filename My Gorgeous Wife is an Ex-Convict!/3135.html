        <h1>Chapter 3133</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the evening, in the apartment, Valda said to Brian, "Thank you for helping me buy the house, now I can bring my godmother over earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she sent money back to her godmother after returning to Emerald City, the old lady still lives alone in a remote village and her life is not easy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So she also wants to bring her godmother over as soon as possible. Without her godmother, she might not even be able to survive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Let me send someone to pick it up later. Can you give me the specific address?" Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mhmm," Valda nodded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although the house has been purchased and does not require further renovation, it still needs to be cleaned. Additionally, many soft furnishings will need to be purchased anew.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And so, in the following days, Valda devoted herself to cleaning and organizing the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Brian arranged for people to help, Valda still wanted to do things herself. When Brian asked why, she smiled and said, "Maybe it will make me feel like I can still do a lot of things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You've always been able to do a lot of things, I just want you to be more relaxed," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I know, but I also want to do more things," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If you really want to do more things, why don't you come with me to a film festival in two days?" Brian suggested.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"A film festival?" Valda was surprised. "There will be a lot of people, won't there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, there will be a lot of people," Brian said, looking at Valda tenderly. "If you don't want to go, it's okay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll go!" she said. She knew that she would face many people that day, especially if she stood by his side, she would become even more of a focus of attention. But she had already decided to walk through the rest of her life with him, so she didn't want to escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Brian said. "If you want to leave early, just let me know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Valda replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two days later, Valda dressed up and accompanied Brian to the film festival.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The attendees were all big names in the entertainment industry, or various business tycoons related to the entertainment industry, as well as many film and television stars, famous directors, and producers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On this occasion, Valda couldn't help but feel nervous, and she instinctively tightened her grip on Brian's arm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he naturally noticed her nervousness, gently stroking the back of her hand, "Don't be nervous, I've got everything under control."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She took a deep breath and then smiled, "Hmm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two people walked into the venue and immediately became the center of attention. The young prince of the entertainment industry, a man who could dominate the industry with ease. Many people wanted to climb the social ladder by getting close to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially female celebrities, they are being watched closely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, if this big shot takes notice of me, I'll soar to great heights in the entertainment industry!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, Valda by Brian's side naturally also attracted a lot of attention.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda is walking slowly while wearing shoes that Brian specially customized for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Brian intentionally slowed down his pace, she still walked with a noticeable limp despite wearing specially tailored shoes and improving her posture. The long formal dress helped to conceal her uneven gait, but it was still somewhat apparent.</p></div>
