        <h1>Chapter 3680</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, I see," William smiled and changed the subject. "By the way, Mason is going to accompany Jasmine to a concert today. Are you going?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I'm not interested. Besides, it's not just Jasmine and Mason going. Tina and Chandler are going too," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then after the birthday banquet, how about you accompany me somewhere?" he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where are we going?" she asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He smiled slightly, "You'll know when we get there."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After everyone had finished lunch, the birthday party finally came to an end. People left one by one. When Tina left, she said goodbye to Jasmine, "Jasmine, don't forget to come with me to the concert tonight!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Got it!" Jasmine nodded her head, "Mason will come with me!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great, see you at the concert!" Tina said, happily leaving with Chandler.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick whispered to Mason, "Are you really going to accompany the little girl to the concert?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Otherwise, how can you replace me?" Mason said calmly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick refused directly, "No, you should go by yourself." He didn't like the noise of concerts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was rare for the little girl to ask Mason to go. He didn't have to endure this kind of fatigue. He was looking forward to it!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason gave Mick a white eye.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mick patted his brother's shoulder and said seriously, "It's rare for you, as Mason, to come back. You should accompany the little girl well. Today is her birthday, you have to make her happy!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Mason pursed his lips and said nothing.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying goodbye to his family, Jasper left the Reed House with William and went to a second-hand market.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper looked puzzled and didn't understand why he brought her here.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you looking to buy something?" Jasper asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've brought you here to see something," said William, leading Jasper into one of the shops. The shop was filled with toys, clearly a second-hand toy store.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, the second-hand items in the store were not cheap toys, but limited edition or discontinued toys, all from high-end brands, and priced at a premium.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Some of these second-hand toys were even priced higher than the original retail price, and some could even be considered antiques.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as the shop owner saw William, he recognized him and immediately put on a friendly smile. "Mr. Barlow, welcome!" he greeted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'd like you to show this young lady the set I was interested in last time," said William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Sure thing!" the shop owner replied, and soon brought out a set of wooden toys.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As soon as Jasper laid eyes on the set of toys, her body stiffened and even her breathing paused. Was this the set of toys she had given to Lawrence? The set of "home" toys for playing house?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The entire set of toys was a wooden toy villa, complete with various scaled-down wooden furniture.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had given this set of toys to Lawrence, and later, when Lawrence and his parents planned to escape Emerald City, Lawrence had taken this set of toys with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But later, his parents were killed, and he lost this set of toys during his escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now, she saw this set of toys reappear before her eyes.</span></p></div>
