        <h1>Chapter 2758</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla replied and ended the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She should deal with this as soon as possible. Otherwise, Nelson would be criticized again if the same rumor spread in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but feel anguished when she thought of the criticism her son had endured because of her prison sentence and for having a single-parent family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want the past to repeat itself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, she dialed Martin Weiss's phone, praying that he would pick up her phone call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, Martin Weiss's voice came from the other end of the line. "What's up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I&rsquo;d like to ask why we're already divorced but there are rumors about you cheating in L City. Even if you brought Nurse Ruan to the banquet, such rumors shouldn't exist. And why didn't you issue a statement that you're divorced?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla asked a series of questions, while Martin Weiss only replied with one sentence. "We're not divorced yet."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Kyla froze, thinking she had heard it wrong.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I haven't filed for divorce, so we're still married," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was dumbstruck. "Why... haven't you done it?" </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Didn't he want me to sign the divorce papers to get rid of me sooner?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had signed the papers, but he had not gone through the formalities.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have no time." He blurted out four words indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"..." Kyla did not know how to describe her mood for a while. "You can ask the lawyer to do it. Doesn't Weiss Group have a legal team?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The company's legal team only takes care of company affairs. It doesn't include the Weiss family's private affairs!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... why don't you send me the agreement and I'll take care of it?" she asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other end of the line was silent. After a long while, his voice came, "Kyla, do you want to divorce me that much?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'He's the one who wants to divorce me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since we both want a divorce, I think it's better to go through the formalities as soon as possible. You&rsquo;ll be divorced soon, so there's no such thing as you having an affair. I also don't want it to affect Nelson and cause him trouble."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have our children always mattered the most to you?" His voice grew colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No! He has become as important as our children to me, perhaps even... more important,' she told herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'But what's the point of that now? I'm only humiliating myself. He&rsquo;ll laugh at me.&rsquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, my children matter the most to me," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The other end of the line was quiet for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla waited a long while before finally saying, "Martin Weiss, are you... still there?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll take care of it. You don't have to worry about the kids," he said and hung up the phone, leaving Kyla staring at her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What the hell is going on? Why didn't he go through with the divorce formalities?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If Martin Weiss had not resisted her so much and refused to lift his hypnosis, she would even think Martin Weiss was reluctant to divorce her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Reluctant...' Kyla laughed sarcastically at herself. She was overthinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That man had no feelings for her anymore.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a mansion's study, Martin Weiss's fingers gripped the phone hard, almost crushing it.</p></div>
