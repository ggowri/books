        <h1>Chapter 355</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her hands rather fixedly. Her hands were now gripping his as if even they were expressing joy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked up and caught sight of her happy smile. Suddenly, he was a little jealous because her smile was not because of him but Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Clearly, Grace was far more important to her than he was!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the car, Brian leaned back in his seat and rubbed his temples gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His secretary, who was also in the car, said to Brian shortly after receiving a phone call, "Mr. Hart, the set of jewelry Miss Cummins chose at the jewelry store is worth 20 million dollars. Do you want Miss Cummins to take them?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">20 million dollars was a little expensive, so the owner of the jewelry store called to inquire about it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said lightly, "Since she has made her choice, she can have them."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right," replied the secretary. Then, he replied to the owner of the jewelry store accordingly. However, he secretly felt that Miss Cummins was too shallow. They had only dated for such a short period and already, she could not wait to join the high society. More recently, she had been going to jewelry stores and luxury stores, seemingly trying hard to look like a socialite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She just took everything she liked and charged it on Master Hart&rsquo;s card.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman was too impatient, but the higher she stood now, the worse she would fall in the future.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Previously, Master Hart usually ignored his ex-girlfriends who were too eager and flamboyant. This time, to the secretary&rsquo;s surprise, Master Hart did not have much of a reaction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it because she was still new? The secretary wondered, but she did not think Evelyn had captivated Master Hart&rsquo;s heart. After all, if a man really liked a woman, he would not just let her pick her own jewelry and act so calm when he spoke of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins has been running up a lot of bills lately. It's almost 30 million so far." The secretary thought it necessary to remind him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is she?" Brian slowly looked up and turned to face the secretary sitting next to him with a half-smile. "Why are some people so eager?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Cummins's probably trying to grab whatever she can," replied the secretary.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What a bore. Maybe they'll end up catching nothing," Brian said as he slowly turned to look out of the window.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although 30 million was nothing to him, he had always been willing to spend money on his girlfriends. He thought of it as compensation for these women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The women who had been his girlfriends before were all looking for money, wealth, resources, fame... However, they were more skillful than Evelyn. At least they would not treat him like some sugar daddy. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It did not matter though. He was keeping Evelyn by his side just to learn more about Grace's past.</p></div>
