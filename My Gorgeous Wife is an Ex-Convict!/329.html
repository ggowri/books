        <h1>Chapter 328</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the wee hours of the day, when Grace was fast asleep in bed, the door between the two rooms opened slowly. A tall figure walked in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Those normally cold, amorous eyes were looking at the woman on the bed. At this moment, his gaze was full of attachment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Good night, Sis." A low and elegant voice spilled out from his mouth, it was tinged with attachment, and at the same time there was also an unspeakable desperation. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace went to work the next day, the store received a large order of more than 30 at noon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Normally, she would only deliver 7 to 8 in one go. All of a sudden, there was an order of more than 30. It was pretty much what the small restaurant would deliver in one afternoon.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla Corbyn hurriedly got the order ready and said to Grace, "Thank you so much for delivering these."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about the other food delivery orders?" said Grace. After all, once she went out to deliver this, she might not be able to deliver the others.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all right. I'll ask my mother to take over the cash register for me after putting Nelson to sleep. I'll go and deliver the rest. We have an extra electric bike anyway," Kyla Corbyn said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The order was a big business for her today. She was happy that she would be able to earn a profit of hundreds of dollars after this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when Grace got the address of the order and looked at it, she was silent. This was the address of... Reed Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The name and phone number on the order were unfamiliar though. They did not belong to Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a slight relief to her. It must be a coincidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once Kyla Corbyn was done packing the orders, Grace put them on the electric bike and headed for Reed Group's headquarters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">30 or so food items were not exactly light, and Grace could not carry them all at once, so she planned to make several trips after she parked the electric bike.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What she did not expect was that when she was parking the electric bike, a security guard approached her and asked, "Excuse me, are you Miss Cummins?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah, yes." Grace was stunned, not expecting the security guard to call out her name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You can put these on the trolley. It'll be easier to get them in," the guard said as he called two more guards to come over.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two security guards wheeled a movable stainless steel trolley to Grace's side and quite automatically placed the 30 or so orders on it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. She could tell that the security guards had been prepared and knew she was coming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you... but how do you know my name? Who told you to prepare this trolley?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Terrence told us, and it was he who told us to prepare this trolley," said the security guard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Terrence?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was skeptical. Was it Terrence, Jason's secretary? She had met Terrence several times when she was in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She subconsciously bit her lip at the thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace nervously pushed her trolley into the Reed Group building, another security guard came up to ask the one who had first spoken to Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Captain, why did Terrence tell us to keep an eye out for this delivery girl? What's her relationship with Terrence?" After all, there were a lot of delivery riders these days. There was a delivery man who delivered 100 cups of milk tea last time, but Terrence never told them to do so.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't pry too much into the higher-ups' business," said the security guard who was called &lsquo;Captain&rsquo;. "Anyway, just don't think of her as a regular delivery girl if you ever see her again."</p></div>
