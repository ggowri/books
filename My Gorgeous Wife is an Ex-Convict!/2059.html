        <h1>Chapter 2057</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss turned to his son and said, "I'll take your mommy home myself. If I want to harm her, it makes no difference whether you're here or not. Who do you think saved you today? If I had gone in a little later, you would have gotten much more badly hurt than this."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Embarrassment flashed across Nelson Corbyn's young face, and his drooping hands at his sides clenched into tiny fists.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the end, Nelson Corbyn left with Mrs. Corbyn. Kyla looked at Martin Weiss and asked, "What on earth do you want to talk about?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla spoke as she withdrew her arm from Martin Weiss's hand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Martin Weiss instantly found his hands empty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She had always done this. Whenever he came a little closer or touched her, she would resist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, she was once the first one to hold his hand. She would say, "Martin, I want to hold your hand forever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Forever... I'm willing to give her the rest of my life, but she no longer wants it.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Let's find somewhere to sit," said Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla refused and said, "No. Just say whatever you want."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Nelson gets bullied a lot, doesn't he?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's expression changed slightly before she replied with a hum.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Society is always full of bullies. If people know Nelson is my son, few will dare to bully him," said Martin Weiss. His flat voice sounded as if he were just stating a simple fact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, only he knew how nervous he was when he said this. Even his hands that were dangling at his sides were trembling slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla stiffened, and a flash of caution crossed her face. "What do you want to do? Do you want Nelson's custody back and have him live with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla felt torn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the past, she would have resisted, but now... she had the idea that maybe it was best if Nelson lived with Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Nelson would be the Weiss family's little young master, not the son of a store owner who was an ex-convict.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">With the Weiss family backing him up, no one would look down on Nelson anymore, let alone discriminate against him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, Kyla could not help but ache at the thought of being separated from her son.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I know Nelson is your everything. Since I gave up the custody, I won't ask it back now. What I want to say is... marry me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if he had summoned all his courage to say those last two words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He watched the sudden change in her expression and felt as if his heart was about to jump out of his throat. She had no idea how nervous and frightened he was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He knew he was despicable to offer her his deepest longing at such a time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Marry... you?" Kyla almost suspected that she misheard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">She and Martin Weiss had already been through so much. She only wished to never meet him again, but now the man asked her to marry him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes, marry me and become the rightful Mrs. Weiss. This way, everyone will know that Nelson is the little young master of the Weiss family. No one will ever discriminate against him again or even dare to beat him up like today!"</p></div>
