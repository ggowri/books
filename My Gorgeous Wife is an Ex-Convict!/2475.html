        <h1>Chapter 2473</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was also missing a ring finger on her right hand. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as the two reports were out, the Mitchell family and the mental hospital Amber Mitchell was previously admitted to instantly became targets of public criticism.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many netizens went to Mitchell Group&rsquo;s and the hospital's official websites to comment and criticize them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Someone even exposed the details of Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s attending doctor online! </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Bang!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the Mitchell family house's living room, Mr. Mitchell slammed his phone on the floor. The internet was now full of insults against the Mitchell family, and he was called all sorts of nasty things. He was even accused of cheating and being an unrespectable, heartless, and unfaithful man. Some people said he planned the death of his first wife!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Mitchell was so mad as he had never been scolded in such a way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Mitchell was also furious. Due to Amber Mitchell's affairs, the scandal about her identity as a former mistress had been uncovered again. The obscene comments online were impossible to read.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Mitchell said, "What do we do? There are a lot of reporters out there. None of them are nice. It's as if they're afraid they're not gonna get a big scoop out of us. We need to quickly come up with a solution, or that b*tch Amber Mitchell will have the upper hand!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Mitchell said bitterly, "That damned girl is always causing trouble. She's even trying to harm the Mitchell family. I should&rsquo;ve let her die in the hospital! I'm going to teach her a lesson after what she has done! I&rsquo;ll go to the hospital and ask her what she's up to. Does she really want to ruin the Mitchell family?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Dad, we'll go to the hospital, but we won&rsquo;t question Sis. We're going to take her home," said Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mr. Mitchell was furious. "What? Take her home?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, and we're going to take Sis home happily. How can we not feel sorry for her after everything she has suffered in the hospital? But Sis caused her own wounds. After all, no one can say for sure what a mental patient can do when they lose their mind! Anyway, we should all be happy that Sis is back to normal after so many years of treatment, shouldn't we?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell's statements immediately made Mr. Mitchell and Mrs. Mitchell come back to their senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, yes, we should be happy. We should take her home happily," said Mr. Xia.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Once Sis comes home and the storm calms down after some time, won't she be in our control? So what even if she has a few friends to help her? The Mitchell family and the Gregory family are still influential in Deer City. It's not up to others to decide!" Louise Mitchell looked like she was in control of everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The reporters at the entrance were the best witnesses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Mitchell family went to the hospital, followed by a group of reporters.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell was packing up her things in the hospital.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though she was packing up, she did not have much stuff&mdash;only some medicine prescribed by the hospital as well as the clothes, shoes, and toiletries Grace had bought for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The once high-spirited eldest heiress of the Mitchell family now had nothing. All she had was a battered body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One hour before she would leave with Grace after getting discharged, Amber Mitchell switched her phone on and browsed through the hot news online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, news of her incident had gone viral.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people wished her luck, felt sorry for her, and hoped she could live a normal life again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there were also some comments about Herman Moss and George Gregory.</p></div>
