        <h1>Chapter 1610</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace also knew she could not mention the incident of her falling into the sea. Even if the case was brought to court, Secretary Wang would be given the benefit of the doubt. If Secretary Wang denied it outright, it would be difficult to convict him without a chain of evidence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Unless... they found something else on him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, he had worked for Old master Reed for so many years. He could not be innocent!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace went to the detention center to meet Secretary Wang again, but this time, she went alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After seeing her, Secretary Wang said, "No matter what you want to ask me, I have nothing to say. You don't have to bother."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I 'm only here to say thank you," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Thank you?" Secretary Wang seemed somewhat surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Thank you for saving my life. I figured that you were the one who saved me even though you were also the one who caused all this. I hate you. If it hadn't been for you, Jay and I wouldn't have separated for five years, have amnesia, and have our children taken from us. But you saved my life and the children's lives."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She also had mixed feelings for the man in front of her. Even though he saved her and the children, she still hated the man!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even if they gave you something sweet, it did not mean they had not hurt you!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"I don't know what you're up to, but I think there must have been a reason why you chose to keep one of the children with you rather than the Reed family or me. It must have been for the Reed family&rsquo;s sake. After all, the Reed family mattered the most to Old Master. What mattered the most to him must also matter the most to you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace said this, she carefully observed Secretary Wang's facial expressions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Secretary Wang lowered his eyes slightly as the corners of his lips were slightly raised. "I have no idea what you're talking about."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace did not go any further and just said, "And thank you for hypnotizing Jay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Without the hypnosis, perhaps Jay would not be alive right now, or he would have broken down even if he survived!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she could, she hoped Jay would never recover... some memories. For example, the memory of her falling into the sea.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">After all, that memory was too painful and sad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had already felt so miserable when she listened to Terrence's description. What would Jay feel if he recovered that memory?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Although Secretary Wang was responsible for the incident where she fell into the sea, the real mastermind was Old master Reed, who was Jay's grandfather!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She left the detention center with her mind already made up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sure enough, her other child was probably alive. If they had died as Secretary Wang said, he would not have avoided her eyes when she mentioned it just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When she mentioned he did it for the Reed family, Secretary Wang's hand had imperceptibly trembled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She just wanted to test Secretary Wang's reaction to confirm things.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Now, she knew the answer. Her child... was still alive!</p></div>
