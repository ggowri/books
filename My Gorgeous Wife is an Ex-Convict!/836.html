        <h1>Chapter 835</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Jason... broke up with Grace? How is that possible? The man who didn't even allow others to have any ideas about her would break up with her?' </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian had known Jason for years, so he knew that he was cold and had never been interested in women. Grace was the only exception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People like Jason would either not love or hold on to it forever once they fell in love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, now there was no forever. He had broken up with her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you break up?" he asked as he stepped closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's personal, and I don't feel the need to tell you, Mr. Hart." She took two steps back from him, putting some distance between them. "If there's nothing else, I want to go home and rest."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, she took out the key, opened the door of the rental house, and went straight in before closing the door.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was left standing in a trance outside the house.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian stared at the tightly closed door. Somehow, her calm expression when she told him about her breakup with Jason made his heart ache a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her calm attitude seemed to be suppressing too much pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I... shouldn't bother about her, but why... do I seem to do it anyway?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian raised his hand slowly, pressing it against his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His heart was beating one beat after another, more intense than usual...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick did not expect Jason and Brian to visit him today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's going on? The two of you have never liked to visit me. Why don't I get someone and we'll play a few rounds of mahjong?" joked Patrick.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian slightly raised his eyes and looked at Jason before saying, "I'm here to see him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're in luck. It's rare for Jay to visit me today," Patrick said as he took out a few glasses and a bottle of wine. He poured each of them a glass of wine. Then, he picked up his glass and took a sip.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Mhmm... It's good wine. It's worth half a million dollars.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason looked at Brian, and their eyes met directly. "You came to see me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just want to confirm if you and Grace have really broken up?" asked Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a split second, the man&rsquo;s cold peach blossom eyes shrank, and a touch of gloom appeared in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Patrick, who was tasting the wine, had not even swallowed it before he spat it out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"They broke up?" Patrick's voice was out of tune.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I did?" Jason's cold voice rang out, causing the pressure in the room to drop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm curious what made you willing to break up with her," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason had a cold expression on his face. 'How I'm willing to... How I'm willing to... If it hadn't been for this man... Grace and I were unlikely to break up!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you know?" Jason's thin lips spat out these four words coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled faintly. "I don't understand. That's why I&rsquo;m asking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, Jason, who had been sitting on the sofa, suddenly got up. He grabbed Brian by the collar and pushed him into the corner. He repeated with anger in his eyes, "What do you know?"</p></div>
