        <h1>Chapter 3687</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had only seen her once during the day, but he had encountered her again at night.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>What was this?! A coincidence?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But too many coincidences between them could be considered a doomed fate.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica was desperately explaining, but her explanation did not calm Angelica's anger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What do you mean by this? I asked you to buy Encounter, but you brought pasta </span><span>from another shop to appease me? Do you think I'll eat any kind of pasta?" Angelica angrily said, "Veronica, you're just a small assistant. Whatever I ask you to do, you should do it!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Some people are desperate to be guests at this concert, just to gain some popularity. But unfortunately, no matter how much they try to gain popularity, it's useless if no one supports them from behind!" A sarcastic voice suddenly sounded, coming from London Todd, who is also a guest performer at today's concert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Unlike Angelica, who is an actress by profession and is only a guest performer at the concert to gain popularity, London Todd is a singer who used to be an actor in the early days. It is said that he had worked with Angelica before and was ridiculed by her, which led to a grudge between the two.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Later, London Todd switched from acting to singing and participated in some singing competitions, which made him famous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Angelica's face changed as she looked at London Todd, whom she used to despise, daring to speak to her like this. She felt disgusted in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Now, even your assistant looks down on you. You can't even afford an Encounter pasta. I think it won't be long before no one wants to work with you anymore." London Todd sneered, "By the way, your former boss who used to support you seems to be broke now. The company is on the verge of bankruptcy. You have bad luck, you picked the wrong tree and hugged the wrong thigh."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"London Todd, if you don't speak, no one will treat you as a mute!" Angelica said fiercely.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What? Can't I speak? I'm just kindly advising you to think of a way out while you still have some looks left. I heard that someone else snatched your lead role opportunity. In the future, you may not even have a chance to play the second or third female lead." London Todd said, laughing triumphantly, as if he was just watching Angelica's joke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica's face turned red with anger. She felt like all the eyes around her were on her, just like London Todd, laughing at her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And all of this was because of this pasta!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Angelica felt resentful towards Veronica. If this assistant had gone to buy the Encounter pasta properly, she wouldn't be here now, being ridiculed by others!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Angelica directly yelled at Veronica, "You go to Encounter now and buy the pasta I want. If you don't buy it before the concert, you won't have an easy time!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But Miss. Kinsman, there's no time." Veronica said. It's only half an hour before the concert, and there's not enough time to take a taxi back and forth!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I want you to buy it, so you have to buy it. Can't you understand human language?" Angelica's voice became even sharper!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Angelica, you're really out of date. You can't even command a small assistant." London Todd added fuel to the fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Angelica was furious, feeling that Veronica's indecisiveness was making her lose face </span><span>and become the target of ridicule. So she threw the pasta that Veronica had bought earlier directly at her.</span></p></div>
