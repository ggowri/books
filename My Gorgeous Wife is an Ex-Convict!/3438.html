        <h1>Chapter 3436</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica was thinking of refusing, but Mason beat her to it and said, "Okay, then I'll come watch the game with Veronica."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica stared at Mason in shock, her eyes filled with surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason... wants to go watch Daniel play ball?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, that's settled then," Daniel smiled and said goodbye to the two before running off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica looked at Mason and asked, "Were you serious earlier? Are you really going to watch the game?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"That's not what you said, Veronica. Do you mind if I spend more time with other people? Now, I'm going to watch a game. Is that okay with you, Veronica?" said Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This... is hope, but why does she have a strange feeling about it? Veronica said hesitantly, "But don't you dislike Daniel?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But he is Veronica's friend, and since he is your friend too, I will get along with him well. This is what you want, right?" He respected her wishes, as this was what she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In front of her, he would play the role of a good younger brother, just like before, only as her brother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, deep down inside him, he also understands that some things can never be the same as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He is just her younger brother, after all. It's just her self-deception.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And he won't easily argue with her anymore. He will show her in his own way that he is the most indispensable person in her world!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Veronica, whatever your hopes are, I will do them for you because you are my Veronica, the most important person to me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He spoke to her in this way.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And in that moment, her heartbeat suddenly became unusually intense!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the weekend, Veronica and Mason went to watch Daniel's game together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The game was held at the opposing school's gym, and because they didn't want the Reed family's car to attract attention, Veronica chose to take the subway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason didn't object to this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As the two walked into the subway station and Veronica was buying tickets, she couldn't help but ask Mason again, "Are you really going to watch the game?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course I am. I came here with you, Veronica. Is that not enough?" he replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And what about Daniel..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I've already said that he's your friend, and I'll get along with him just fine," he said, his gaze falling on her face. "Don't you believe me, Veronica?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, it's just..." She hesitated for a moment before saying, "You seem to have changed, and you're not quite the same as before."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He smiled lightly. "So like this, Veronica doesn't like it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The smile on the corner of his lips softened his originally cold face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She liked to see his smile. When he smiled, it gave people a pure feeling, as if this world had never been polluted, pure as white paper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And this purity is something that many people have never had.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong, Veronica?" He looked at her somewhat absent-mindedly and couldn't help but ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She came back to her senses and quickly replied, "Nothing, I just think you look really good when you smile."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then in the future, if Veronica wants to see me smile, I can smile for you anytime," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She shook her head. "A good smile has to come from the heart. You can't just smile whenever you want! Alright, let's go!" She said, taking the initiative to hold his hand and walk towards the subway checkpoint.</p></div>
