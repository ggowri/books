        <h1>Chapter 4035</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy finally let go of her worries.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He and the baby were the most important people to her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will...get better, wait for me..." These were the last words she said to him before she was too exhausted to keep her eyes open.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I will wait for you and be with you." His low and gentle voice sounded in her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the following days, Nancy gradually recovered her health.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick would visit her in the ICU every day, showing her videos and photos of their daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">By the way, she gave birth to a cute little angel, a baby girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick thought the baby looked like her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy couldn't see the resemblance, as the baby was much smaller than a normal newborn. But she thought the baby's eyes were very similar to Mick's charming eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Very beautiful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If the baby inherited her father's looks in other ways, then their daughter would be a great beauty in the future! Nancy thought to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the tenth day, she finally left the ICU and returned to a regular hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the VIP single patient room, an extra bed was added besides the patient's bed for Mick to stay overnight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy felt that her body was gradually recovering, and with the Reed family providing several specialized nursing staff for her, Mick didn't need to stay overnight in the hospital room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, she sometimes needed to change medication at night, and even groaned due to the pain and side effects of the medication, which could easily affect his sleep. It would be better for him to go back and sleep instead.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick hadn't spoken yet, but after listening, Jasper quickly said, "Nancy, please don't let my brother go back to sleep. If he goes back, he'll definitely have insomnia! You don't know, when you were in the ICU, he would lie on the bed you slept in every night and hold your clothes to fall asleep!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned. She never expected Mick to do such a thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And Mick, who rarely showed his emotions, seemed a bit embarrassed. But Nancy noticed that his ears were...well, a bit redder than usual!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So, was he feeling embarrassed?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After Jasper left the ward, Nancy looked at Mick and asked, "Did you really...sleep in the hospital all those days, like Jasper said?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm," he replied softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"And you held my clothes?" she asked again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm," he replied again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Did you imagine the clothes were me?" she continued to ask.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His response seemed even quieter this time, "Hmm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Look at me," Nancy couldn't help but say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">So far, he had avoided facing her and having a face-to-face conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Silence was his only response.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong? Are you really feeling embarrassed?" Nancy asked curiously. The more he avoided her, the more she wanted to see his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Then she heard a sigh in her ear, "Okay, I am really feeling embarrassed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Huh?" Nancy blinked and saw Mick turn his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On his handsome face, there was a noticeable blush!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy was stunned, this was too...</p></div>
