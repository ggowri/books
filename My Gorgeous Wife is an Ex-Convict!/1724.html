        <h1>Chapter 1722</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said lightly, "Okay." Then, his eyes fell on the ten men.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">These ten men had already found out about Grace's identity from Manager Wang earlier. When Grace called him &lsquo;Jay&rsquo;, they figured out Jason's identity at once.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Young master Reed! In Emerald City, Young master Reed rarely appeared in front of the media and it was difficult to find any information or photos of Young master Reed online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, they now... were now meeting him in person in such a place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You&rsquo;ve been drinking with them here?" asked Jason with a faint hint of jealousy in his voice. Although the ten men were dressed differently and looked different as well, they were good-looking. Their looks were the type women liked. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace trembled a little. She heard the jealous tone in his voice and quickly said, "I... I'm just helping Lina to relax. I didn't drink much."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At most, she just drank a few shots. On the other hand, Lina had drunk a lot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Really?" Jason swept his gaze across the ten men's faces. "What do you think about their looks?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">These ten men immediately felt their hair standing on end. When customers said they were good-looking, they had always taken it as compliments. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, they would rather Mrs. Reed find them horrendously ugly. If she said they were good-looking or anything of the like, they probably would not be able to leave with their faces intact.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"No, no, we're just average-looking."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, average. So average! We're definitely not good-looking!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"We... We're... Uh... We&rsquo;re just drinking with Mrs. Reed's friend. We... We didn't drink with Mrs. Reed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The men stammered, and Grace was between laughter and tears at their eagerness to save their lives.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, Jason was still seriously waiting for Grace's answer as if he would stay here with her if she did not give him a satisfactory answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In front of so many people, Grace said awkwardly to Jason, "They don't look as good as you. What else can I say?" It was true. After all, there were very few men who could match Jason when it came to looks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason was quite satisfied with the answer. "From now on, even if Lina dragged you here, you're not allowed to come to places like this without me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Huh?" Grace looked hesitantly at Jason. After seeing how he reacted, she dared not tell him that she would come to such places for gatherings with colleagues or even work in the past few years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason said, "Come on. Let's send Lina home first."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, Grace tried to pull Lina up from the couch. Lina shouted drunkenly, "I'm not leaving. I haven't... I haven't drunk enough! Grace, though... these guys aren't as good-looking as your husband, they're... not too bad. I... I don't believe that I... I can't get over Hadwin Stephenson!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Alright, Lina, let's go home. I'll drink with you again another day if you want," said Grace. Then, she saw Jason's face darken.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace could only laugh drily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason pressed his thin lips together, looking helpless. He knew how important Lina was to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She could even give up her life for Lina!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, he could only tolerate it no matter how jealous he was of Lina.</p></div>
