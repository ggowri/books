        <h1>Chapter 447</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As Grace put her phone away, she heard Jason's voice. "Was that a call from Lina?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why? Did she ask Hadwin to help with your case?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not really," said Grace. "She just asked Hadwin to investigate a witness in S City. She said the witness is now in detention and he has ways to make him talk. I'm going to S city tomorrow."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though Lina did not elaborate on how it happened, Grace, a former lawyer, knew some of the ropes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was not that easy to talk to a man in detention. With Lina's abilities, it was out of the question. Therefore, it was probably Hadwin's doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this was clearly her business, but she let Lina owe Hadwin a debt of gratitude again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just how much did Lina have to do for her? Would she ever be able to repay Lina? Grace's heart was heavy with the thought of it. She did not notice Jason's eyes glinting.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll go with you tomorrow," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It&rsquo;s okay, I'll just go with Lina," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're my girlfriend. Why would it bother me to accompany you? It's settled, then. I'll go with you tomorrow," Jason said firmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His hand on the steering wheel tightened a little. There were some calculations in his mind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Lina was on the phone arranging the time with Grace at night, Grace said, "Oh yes. Well... Jason, that's Jason&hellip; He wants to go too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Lina was stunned for a moment. "He's going too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, is that okay?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's nothing inconvenient about it. It's just one extra person, but... Why don't we go in one car? It's not very convenient to talk to each other if we go in two cars. If we go in one car, they can take turns driving when they're tired."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure, I'll talk to him," said Grace. There was tension in her heart when she finished the call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it possible for her to extract the truth from the witness called You tomorrow? Would she be able to find out why the witness had testified about her drinking as well as who wanted to frame her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could seek the truth for other people's cases and help others with their lawsuits, but she could not find out the truth for her own case. How ridiculous and pathetic was that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In Reed Residence's study, Jason said to Terrence who had hurried over there, "Go to S City. The police arrested a man with the last name You. He was one of the witnesses in Grace's case. Grace is going to see him tomorrow. Tell him what to say and what not to say."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," replied Terrence. Then, he hesitantly asked, "Aren't you going to let Miss Cummins know the truth about what happened, Young Master Reed?"</p></div>
