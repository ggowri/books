        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why is that?" he looked at her puzzled.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Well... um, there's something about it that makes it feel more like we're a couple," she explained the reason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He paused for a moment, then said, "Okay, we can buy a few more things. And also, we're not just like a couple, we are a couple now."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him and felt even warmer inside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side of the campus festival, Jasper was walking around with William.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you think Mason and Sister Veronica are still at school now?" Jasper muttered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If we calculate the time, they should be at school by now," William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Should I call Mason and meet up with him?" Jasper said, taking out his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to meet up with him now? Aren't you afraid of disturbing their alone time?" William said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper agreed, "You're right. Mason and Sister Veronica have just made up, they should have more time alone."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I think we also need more alone time," William said, "During this time, you've been busy with your class activities, don't you think we've had less time alone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I know, I'll make it up to you," Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Make it up? How?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As he spoke, his eyelashes lifted slightly, and there seemed to be a shimmering flow between his eyebrows and eyes, making Jasper feel a rush of heat in her body.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It felt like after becoming a couple, she would always have more fantasies about him than before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked around and noticed that because of the school festival, everyone was heading towards the booths. However, where they were standing was a quiet area with not many people around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper then wrapped his arms around William's neck, stood on his tiptoes, and kissed him on the cheek. "There, that's your compensation."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that all?" His eyes darkened, "Don't you think this compensation is a bit too light?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She looked at him, pleading with him to understand that his expression and words were making it hard for her to resist the urge to pounce on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If there was a bed nearby, she might actually do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Didn't your dad teach you that boys should protect themselves when they're outside?" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William slowly bent down, matching her height, and brought his face closer to hers. "My dad is afraid that you won't 'bully' me enough."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper blushed, realizing that since they started dating, William, who used to be a good boy in her eyes, had become bolder in his speech, and his words always seemed to suggest something more.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never heard him speak so boldly before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You seem different from before," Jasper murmured.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His eyes flickered slightly, and his warm breath sprayed on her face. "Would you hate this kind of difference?" His voice contained a hint of imperceptible unease.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I actually quite like it," she smiled, "Anyway, no matter how different you are, you're still my boyfriend, William."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, I am yours," he said, "And you're mine, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper blushed even more. Okay, he only left out the words "boyfriend" and "girlfriend" in his sentence, but why did it make her heart beat faster?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thump! Thump! Thump!</span></p></div>
