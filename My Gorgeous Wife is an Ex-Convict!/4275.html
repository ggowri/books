        <h1>Chapter 4273 Eavesdropping in the Garden</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was shocked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was she looking at Chandler with the gaze of someone who likes him?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Like... that can't be!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even if she had some liking for Chandler in her heart before, after knowing his true intentions in approaching her, she no longer likes him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You misunderstood, </span><span>Maybe</span><span> it's just because he was someone I liked before I lost my memory, but I don't remember anything from the past anymore," Tina said. "I don't want to be bound by past feelings."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley couldn't help feeling sorry for Chandler, "But in that case, isn't Chandler pitiful? He loves you so much."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina remained </span><span>silent,</span><span> does he love me? Unfortunately, Chandler's feelings for her are not pure love.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's hard to say who is more pitiful between her and Chandler now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley seemed to realize his rudeness and quickly said, "Tina, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say you shouldn't get a divorce, I just..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand." Tina smiled faintly, "I'm going to take a breath in the back garden."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll accompany you," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You are the protagonist of the party today, don't accompany me. I'll take a breath and come in later." Tina said, walking towards the back garden.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The meticulously maintained garden, although it was night, was not pitch black because of the many hanging lamps and lamp posts placed in the garden. Instead, it gave a different beauty than during the day.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina walked into the garden, the silence here was different from the hustle and bustle in the hall, which allowed her to relax a little.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Maybe because she and Chandler both attended this party today, she could always feel many gazes on her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even those people whom she might have been familiar with before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But for her now, most of these people could be considered as strangers whom she had only met a few times.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as Tina was looking at the scenery in the garden, suddenly footsteps could be heard not far away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina frowned, turned around, and hid in a dark corner nearby.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, she just wanted to be quiet, she didn't want to greet anyone, nor did she want to face the various strange gazes of others.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Originally, she thought that the person would quickly pass by, but when the footsteps got closer, they stopped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Then a young man's voice rang out, "Have you really decided to have no more involvement with Tina?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's body suddenly stiffened, could it be that among the people who came, there was...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes!" When the familiar voice sounded, Tina's body couldn't help but tremble.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was Chandler!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she helps, the curse on your body can be easily resolved, but you actually plan to bypass this shortcut, it really makes people puzzled."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't want to force her."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>So</span><span> you got a divorce?" the other person sneered, "If it were the old Tina, after knowing your situation, I don't know if she would still divorce you."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"She wouldn't," Chandler said in a low voice.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The other person's voice carried a hint of surprise, "She wouldn't? Does the old Tina know </span><span>about the curse?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, she knows," Chandler said with a nostalgic smile on his lips. It was really good back then.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If a person loses their memory, they lose their emotions as well. It seems like her feelings for you aren't really strong," the person continued.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Lornell, don't say that. It's because I'm not good enough," Chandler said softly.</span></p></div>
