        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Jason said with a smirk. "If Valda has a daughter this time, what will you do when she grows up and wants to be with a boy you don't approve of?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well, if I have a daughter, I will protect her and make sure she never suffers any injustice. And if she wants to be with a boy I don't approve of, I have ways to make sure he never betrays her," Brian replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What about a son?" Jason asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll make sure to toughen him up and not spoil him too much," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was clear that Brian had a double standard when it came to daughters and sons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What if your son looks like Valda?" Jason asked with a smirk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian fell silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If his son looked like Valda, he would have to think carefully about how to handle the situation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lawrence watched in bewilderment as his parents frantically packed their belongings into suitcases.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Daddy, Mommy, are we leaving?" he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">While everyone else was enjoying the festive season, his family was being visited by one debt collector after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He overheard his parents arguing and knew that Mommy owed a lot of money outside.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Auntie Grace had previously arranged for Mommy to slowly repay the debt, but Mommy went to borrow from loan sharks and gambled the money away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, they were left with nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daddy and Mommy had a fight last night, and he was in his room listening to their angry voices, too scared to say anything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, Daddy and Mommy started packing, but... if he didn't live here, would Jasper be able to find him in the future?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, we're leaving, we have to leave quickly, or how will we repay those debts!" Wilona told her son, "You go and pack your things."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But..." Lawrence hesitated, "Can I not move out? I want to stay here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What are you going to stay here for, to become a beggar?" Wilona said unkindly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Doran glared at his wife with resentment and said, "Why are you getting angry at the child? It's all because of the trouble you caused. Why did you have to borrow from loan sharks when there are other places to borrow money from? Those people are dangerous and if you don't pay them back, they will resort to violence!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I...I'm not doing this for the sake of our family!" Wilona argued, "I just want to make a quick profit and pay off those gambling debts. Otherwise, with so much money owed, how are we going to clear it all?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So can you pay off your debt now?" Doran said irritably, "We're about to lose our home!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, do you want me to be chopped to death before you're satisfied?" Wilona snapped in frustration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Doran was holding his breath, his face turning red. If his son wasn't there, he might have started fighting with his wife again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"We...we could go and ask Uncle Reed and Auntie Grace. They might be able to help our family," Lawrence said hesitantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his opinion, as long as Uncle Reed and Auntie Grace are willing to help them, their family will definitely be saved!</p></div>
