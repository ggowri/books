        <h1>Chapter 727</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'When will Grace come out?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'She had already promised me that she would never betray me, but why did she go see a psychiatrist?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does she still want to restore her old memories of Brian?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason watched quietly, and finally, a figure in a white dress came into sight.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It's Grace!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though she was surrounded by a moving crowd, he recognized her instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Then, he saw her take out her phone and seemed to be making a call.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Moments later, his phone rang. He pulled it out and looked down at the caller ID&ndash;&rsquo;Sis&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he no longer called her that, he had not changed the name on his phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was some kind of reminiscence. The woman had once said to him with a smile, "Will you be my brother?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She even said, "From now on, you matter to me and I matter to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Sis... Sis&hellip;'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Back then, he did not know that this woman would make him fall in love with her so deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the phone continued to ring, Jason pressed the answer button and listened to her clear voice. "Jason, where are you now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at the figure in front of the hospital from afar and answered, "I'm in the office right now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll come and see you later. It's not time to have lunch yet, right? I'll bring lunch over later. What would you like to eat?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anything will do. Just buy as you please."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"All right."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The figure in front of the hospital put away her phone, raised her hand, and began to hail a taxi.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason ordered the driver blandly, "Go back to the office."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace bought two sets of lunch and two apples before going to Reed Group's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Grace had created quite a buzz on the internet, her chances of being recognized were not high. Not many people in Reed Group knew her because some news about her was removed instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, this did not include the security guards and the receptionist at the building's entrance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, when she was a rider at the small restaurant, she came here every day to deliver food to Jason, so the security guards and receptionist were familiar to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, upon seeing her, the security guards and the receptionist immediately greeted her, but in a more deferential manner than usual.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The receptionist also escorted Grace to the elevator and helped Grace to press the buttons.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only when Grace got into the elevator and the doors closed that the receptionist breathed a great sigh of relief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Who was that woman? Why are you so respectful?" A passing employee came up and asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The future mistress of the company. Tell me, could I disrespect her?" replied the receptionist.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Of course, Grace, who was in the elevator, did not know what the others were talking about. When the elevator doors re-opened, Grace got out and walked in the direction of the president's office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was unimpeded all the way. After all, the people on this floor knew that she was the person their boss treasured dearly. Who would dare to stop her?</p></div>
