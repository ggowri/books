        <h1>Chapter 577</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She spoke agitatedly and looked as if she had been wronged. However, upon meeting his gaze, she somehow felt guilty.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're right. You're my girlfriend," Brian muttered to himself. Then, he got up and slowly walked up to Evelyn.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn felt a burst of joy. Was he willing to trust her? He was not indifferent to her after all!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian walked up to Evelyn and gently raised his hand to lift her chin. Evelyn looked submissive; her eyes were watering slightly, and she seemed innocent and pitiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was still an actress, even if she was only a D-list actress. Naturally, she had acting skills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, she was pretty experienced in acting pitiful and innocent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian, if you think I&rsquo;ve wronged my sister, I can go and apologize to her. It doesn't matter if the people on the internet will scold me even more," Evelyn said meekly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian gently raised his fingers and pressed it against her lips. "Do you know why I asked you to be my girlfriend?" He asked suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Huh?!' Evelyn was stunned. 'Why?!' She had asked herself many times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, there was no shortage of beautiful women in the entertainment industry. Not to mention, the entertainment industry was full of women more beautiful than her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Whatever it is, I'm lucky to be your girlfriend." She thought it was the perfect answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Brian heard this, he scoffed. "Lucky? Just because of the resources I gave you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's not that!" Evelyn hurriedly denied. "Even if you hadn&rsquo;t given me any resources, I would have considered it my greatest blessing. I love you, Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But I don't love you," Brian said mercilessly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn turned pale. Even though she was aware that he might not love her, when he really said it, there was no doubt that it destroyed her imagination.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your lips look like 'hers'. That's why I asked you to be my girlfriend. However, only your lips look like 'hers'. The rest of you look nothing like 'her'," Brian said lightly, "All right, it all ends here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It all ends here? What does he mean?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn began to panic. "What do you mean by it all ends here? What are you saying, Brian?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you understand?" Brian asked lightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">For a second Evelyn felt a chill rise up her back. There was nothing but indifference and alienation in his beautiful eyes she had once been so fascinated by.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if the man in front of her had already sentenced her to death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">No, she did not want that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Only her ear heard his voice ring, "Let's break up. As for the resources I gave you, you can still obtain them with your own abilities."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He uttered a plain sentence as if it was a common thing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Evelyn's scalp tingled!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Break up? Was he really breaking up with her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Forget about her future resource problems. If they broke up just like that, and if she did not manage to put an end to the online scandal, her advertisers and investors might be the first to seek compensation from her. Not to mention, she might not be able to finish the contracts she had signed with the TV series and commercials she had been working on.</p></div>
