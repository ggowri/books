        <h1>Chapter 3343</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You, sometimes, being too accommodating to others may not necessarily be a good thing. It's good to be kind to someone, but sometimes, you need to have boundaries. If you're too kind without boundaries, then that person may take your kindness for granted and not cherish it," Philip said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although his son was only 10 years old, he was mature for his age due to his experiences. He thought more like an adult than other children his age.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"My kindness to her is only natural!" William said. "If it weren't for Jasper, I wouldn't be who I am today. When others hit me or insulted me, Jasper helped me. She never looked at me with discriminatory eyes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Whether he was the son of a criminal or the young master of the Barlow family, Jasper was always consistent in her treatment of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Philip sighed upon hearing this and said, "If you've truly made up your mind, then I won't say anything more. I just hope that in the future, Jasper's child will be able to repay the kindness you've shown her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">William didn't say anything and walked towards the bedroom.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He will do everything in his power to treat Jasper well and make her happy. He also believes that Jasper's future will definitely be with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Two days later, Grace took the triplets, William, and Veronica, the daughter of the Barlow family, to visit Valda and the newly born baby Harley at the Hart family's place.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Now, Valda has returned to the villa and is sitting her confinement period.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Today, the villa is particularly lively because Lina has brought Chandler and Tina over. Suddenly, with a total of 7 children, the Hart family's villa is filled with the crisp voices of children everywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda is in her postpartum period, but she is still able to move around and is not confined to bed rest like traditional postpartum practices.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How's your body?" Grace asked with concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Pretty good," said Valda. How could it not be? Brian had practically assembled a medical team to be on call at the villa at all times, ready to spring into action at the slightest hint of anything being amiss with her or the child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Moreover, the nanny and caregiver took care of her and the child meticulously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Her godmother Lisa had originally planned to come and take care of her during her postpartum period, but after considering it, she realized that she wouldn't be much help, so she just came over often to visit the baby and chat with Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Why didn't Jasmine come with you?" asked Valda. She thought that since Grace was coming today, she would bring Jasmine along too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"By the way, why didn't you bring your youngest daughter? I haven't seen her in a long time," Lina also leaned in and said. She really wanted to hug and kiss Jasmine!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Grace said, 'She caught a cold these past few days and it's inconvenient to bring her along. Let's do it next time.'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Caught a cold? Are you okay?" Lina and Valda asked with almost identical concern.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">They all know that Jasmine's physical condition is weaker than other children due to her premature birth, which makes her more susceptible to illness.</p></div>
