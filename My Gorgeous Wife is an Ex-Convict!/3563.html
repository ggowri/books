        <h1>Chapter 3561</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This scene in front of him made him feel like he had gone back many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Back then, he always liked to watch her play the piano and listen to her music.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Even though she always said she liked his piano playing, in reality, she played much better than him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that time, he made a vow in his heart that one day he would play the piano so well that she would always love his music.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Thinking back, he was really naive and ridiculous back then. He was willing to do anything for her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In his eyes, she was like a deity who changed the fate of their family. He felt grateful, respectful, and fond of her...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But now, he had to bring her down from her pedestal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, a voice rang out, "Oh, you're awake!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Roger realized that the sound of the piano had stopped at some point, and Jasper was now turning to look at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His expression changed slightly, and he was secretly annoyed at himself for being distracted earlier. "What are you doing here?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I came to find you," she replied. "But when I came in, I saw that you were sleeping and seemed to be restless. I couldn't wake you up, so I tried using music therapy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Music therapy?" he scoffed. "Just a piano piece. Can that really be called therapy?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Different types of music can correspond to different conditions of patients. The piece I played earlier can be very useful in stabilizing emotions such as anxiety, restlessness, and fear. So I tried it, and now you..." She looked at him and said, "You seem to be feeling better now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He squinted his eyes and asked, "Anxious, uneasy, and fearful? What makes you think I have these emotions?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because..." She paused and noticed that there was a thin layer of sweat on his forehead. She grabbed a tissue and walked up to him. "Because you slept restlessly and kept saying 'don't hit me' in your sleep. That's why I think so."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As she was standing and he was sitting, she tried to wipe the sweat off his forehead while speaking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, before her hand could touch his forehead, he suddenly grabbed her wrist tightly. "You said I was shouting 'don't hit me' in my dream?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes," she replied. "Did you have a bad dream? Or did I mishear it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His thin lips were tightly pursed. Had he dreamt of his darkest time again? Back then, he was taken away by the person who killed his parents in the hospital and tortured repeatedly... He was lucky to survive and escape.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, even though he escaped from that darkness, he could never forget it. He always had nightmares and woke up from them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What I dreamt of has nothing to do with you. Also, what are you trying to do?" He said coldly, his gaze falling on the plain hand he held.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just wanted to help you wipe the sweat off your forehead," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need," he said, letting go of her hand and getting up to grab a tissue to wipe the thin sweat off his forehead himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At this moment, there seems to be a deliberate unfamiliarity emanating from him, making it difficult for people to approach him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He is like a lone wolf, not allowing others to enter his world, yet unwilling to step out of it himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What has happened to this person?</p></div>
