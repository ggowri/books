        <h1>Chapter 3926</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it just her imagination? Or... "Is this also your sympathy? Or maybe... forgive me for being presumptuous, Mr. Reed, do you like me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy spoke these words bluntly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's dark eyes suddenly stared at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This gaze seemed to be filled with surprise and shock, as if scrutinizing something.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The air was filled with a suffocating silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy felt as if her palms were sweating unconsciously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"If I really liked you?" Mick's voice suddenly sounded, "What would you do?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Nancy stared at Mick blankly, seeming to be a little slow to react for a moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" He raised his voice, and she finally came back to her senses.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." What should she say? If he really liked her, could she use him to get justice from the Schultz family?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This thought emerged in her mind and grew wildly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't worry, I'm not interested in you." Mick's voice sounded in Nancy's ear again, "I said it was my rare kindness, but my kindness ends here. After you leave here in the morning, we will have nothing to do with each other."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The indifferent voice sounded unapproachable.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It wasn't until Nancy left Mick's room and returned to her own guest room that she finally laughed bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">What was she thinking? Fantasizing that Mick would be interested in her and she could use him to get justice from the Schultz family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But what kind of person was Mick? How could he possibly be interested in her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And even more so, how could he go against the Schultz family for her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was impossible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mick's words only made her understand what reality was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night, Nancy never really fell asleep. The next morning, she packed her things, said goodbye to the servants, and left Mick's villa alone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">That night was so unreal for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And she was just an ordinary person after all. Even if she had suffered so much, even if she had become an orphan now, she still had to work hard to earn a living, to survive.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Life seemed to have become calm again, only when it was quiet at night and she looked at her mother's photo, did she feel that her mother had really left her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A month passed quickly, and it was soon her mother's 57th birthday.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">During this time, Mick never appeared in front of her again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As he said, he was only kind to her for a moment. Her fantasies were just her own wishful thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Nancy, it's time to get off work," a colleague greeted her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm." She responded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Are we going to have dinner together tonight?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, you guys go ahead. I have something to do tonight." She politely declined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tonight is her mother's 57th birthday. It is said that the deceased will return home on this day to see their loved ones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If there really are souls after death, she doesn't know which home her mother will return to.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But for her, all she can do is cook a meal in her rented room and pay her respects to her mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as Nancy walked out of the hotel, she was suddenly slapped in the face.</p></div>
