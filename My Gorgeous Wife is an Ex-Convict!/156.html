        <h1>Chapter 155</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She reached out for her cellphone to look at the time. It was 3 a.m. and she could sleep for a few more hours.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just as she was about to shut her eyes, she suddenly sat bolt upright. The next instant, she stared in disbelief, her eyes wide open.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">A man was sitting by the dining table in her rental apartment, playing with the silver bracelet that had been in her pocket.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Under the light, the man looked like a painting that been drawn on a piece of rice paper. His brows were thick, and his nasal bridge was high. His lips were thin, and he had a pair of beautiful phoenix eyes. When he curled his lips and looked at her, he seemed cold and aloof.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">As he looked at her, Grace felt as if he was a mirage.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Is this man real? Am I... dreaming?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Are you awake?" The man's voice broke the silence in the room.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace suddenly came to her senses and realized that she was not dreaming. Everything was real!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You, who are you? Why are you in my apartment in the middle of the night?" Grace tried her best not to scream. She quietly stretched out her hand to pick up her cellphone so that she could call the police when the man was not watching her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, before she could get her hands on the cellphone, the man said, "If you're thinking of calling the police, you can forget about it. If I wanted to harm you, I would have done so while you were sleeping."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace froze at his words. The man seemed to have read her mind.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why are you..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This is my bracelet," Brian said as he stood up. He slowly made his way to the bed and said, "It was stolen today."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I didn't steal it. When I saw it, it was already in my pocket," Grace explained immediately.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I know you didn't steal it," Brian said. "If it was you, you wouldn't still be here in one piece."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace bit her lip and grabbed hold of the quilt tightly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">This man seemed cold and dangerous. She wondered when he had entered her rental apartment without her realizing it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When she saw him playing with the bracelet, she believed that he had been there for some time.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, she hadn't noticed it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After thinking for a while, she concluded that he must be something special. No ordinary man could search her out and get into her apartment unnoticed. When the man got near her, she noticed that his attire was high quality. His suit and wristwatch were branded and expensive. However, she found it puzzling that this kind of man would barge into her apartment for the sake of a cheap bracelet!</p></div>
