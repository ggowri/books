        <h1>Chapter 2795</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Old Madam arranged it,&rdquo; a member of his staff replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss instantly got up and instructed, "Prepare the car to return to the old residence!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Half an hour later, Martin Weiss arrived at the Weiss family's old residence and met Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you arrange the press conference?" Martin Weiss asked as he looked at his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I did it for the Weiss family and the company. It's the fastest way," said Mrs. Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought I told you I have nothing to do with her anymore. Why involve her with us again?" Martin Weiss asked through clenched teeth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mrs. Weiss explained, "Yes, I hope you have nothing to do with her as well. But with the present situation, it only works when she says it herself! Besides, I've made it clear to her that she'll only be saying that to dispel the rumors. You two are only delaying your divorce for a while. She&rsquo;ll never be able to be the Weiss family's daughter-in-law."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss frowned. "So you're only using her?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Or what? What else could it be? You'll divorce her when this is all over, won't you? You don't want to keep the divorce papers around forever, do you?" Mrs. Weiss said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pressed his thin lips tightly and said nothing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had wanted to divorce Kyla, but she was unwilling to end their relationship. However, he suddenly became reluctant when she tried to end it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If he signed that agreement, they would have had nothing to do with each other except for their relationship with the children!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've spoken with Kyla. I asked her to stay in L City for some time to give the public the illusion that you're a loving couple. You can divorce in another year or so," said Mrs. Weiss. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss rejected and said, "No thanks! If we want to create an illusion, it'll work the same if I go to Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're going to Emerald City?" Mrs. Weiss was shocked. Then, she immediately replied, "No, you&rsquo;re not in the right shape to go to Emerald City."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What right shape? Didn't Kyla come here from Emerald City before? She had a liver transplant after giving birth. Speaking of which, she's in worse shape than I am!" Martin Weiss said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was stunned after saying that. 'Yeah, she's in worse shape than I am. But I have doctors and nurses around to take care of me, but she doesn&rsquo;t. She never asked for anyone to look after her during her time at my mansion either.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss only felt a pain in his heart when he thought of it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Kyla. Why does she keep causing me pain? She had already made me miserable before the hypnosis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'After the hypnosis, she&rsquo;s still continuing to cause me pain. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or is it true that I still love Kyla as Shana Nicholls said?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'No matter what I do, will I always fall for Kyla... Am I going to love that woman again with no way of escaping?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although Grace had been staying at home to take care of her unborn baby as per the doctor's orders, she still learned about Kyla's press conference. She also hurriedly called Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla was afraid that Grace would have mood swings again because of her, so she hurried to the Reed family&rsquo;s house to visit Grace and tell her about her deal with Mrs. Weiss.</p></div>
