        <h1>Chapter 951</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brother!" Zoe limped to Sean's side and asked urgently, "Can you remove the trending search?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If the video existed any longer online, even by just a minute, then it would not be impossible for hundreds of thousands of people to witness her embarrassing state. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She felt queasy just by thinking about the video.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean shook his head.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why can&rsquo;t it be removed? Is it about money? Are you refusing to spend more money to help me remove it?" Zoe got even more anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not about the money! We can't remove it with money because no one dares to remove it!" said Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" Zoe refused to believe it. "As long as you offer them enough money, why would anyone refuse to make money?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean looked at his sister as he sighed, slowly uttering the words, "Jason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoe's face paled immediately. She could not stand steadily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason refuses to take it down? Why... Didn't he let us off the hook that day..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoe's voice suddenly stopped. Jason had never said that he would let her off the hook that day! It was her mere wishful thinking that he would!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Did the video have anything to do with Jason?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Was it because she said Grace had been on all fours and ate like a dog when she was in prison, so Jason wanted her to experience it too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Zoe could not help trembling at the thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This time, she felt Jason's cruelty going far beyond the previous time. If one made an enemy of such a man&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That was why people said Jason was the most dangerous man in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll arrange for you to go abroad again later. You can come back once this is over," said Sean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mom and Dad said they&rsquo;re going to introduce me to the sons of our family friends. Would this video affect that? After all... I wasn&rsquo;t in my normal state when this video was filmed. I was set up.&rdquo; Zoe was still hopeful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sean patted his sister on the shoulder. "Zoe, when you come back, I'll see if there are any nice men in the company and introduce them to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean, Brother? Did those families reject me after seeing the video? I'm the daughter of the Stevens family after all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's not a bad idea to marry an ordinary person," Sean said tactfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The remark made Zoe go weak.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Marry an ordinary man? If the daughter of a rich and powerful family like me marries an ordinary man, then I&rsquo;ll be humiliated for life!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's all Grace's fault. It's all Grace's fault!" Zoe said bitterly. 'If it wasn't for Grace, would I end up like this?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'How can I accept this?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't mess with Grace anymore. She has Jason backing her. You can't afford to mess with her," said Sean as mixed feelings glinted in his eyes.</p></div>
