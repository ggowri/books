        <h1>Chapter 1847</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was the woman... he had hated for so many years!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Hahaha... Hahaha..." Cold laughter suddenly rang out in the office. Jason had begun to laugh. His laughter became louder and louder while his eyes gradually turned red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The person he had been looking for all this while had appeared in front of him in such a way. He was even grateful to her in the beginning; grateful that she had taken care of Grace and their daughter!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His father loved her so much that he chose death after losing her, but she found another man and was living a happy, peaceful life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'How dare she show up in front of me? Who is she to let the children call her Grandma?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'How would my father feel if he learns that the woman he loved has married another man under a different name and is leading a peaceful life?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Dad... This is the woman you love... A woman like this killed you... Haha... Haha... Dad, don't worry. I'm definitely... I'm definitely not going to let her off the hook. I'm going to make her pay for what she has done with the rest of her life!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace spent most of the day with her mentor and his wife in the hospital before returning to Reed Residence at around three o&rsquo;clock. She learned from Uncle Kwan that Jay had returned early today.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was a little surprised because Jay rarely came home so early.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Where&rsquo;s Jay now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young Master went to the mourning hall as soon as he came back," said Uncle Kwan.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"The mourning hall?" Grace frowned. She turned around and headed there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The mourning hall was silent when she got there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace entered the mourning hall, only to see Jason standing like a statue in front of his father's memorial tablet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though all she could see was his back, there was a momentary silence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">There seemed to be a sense of loneliness exuding from him. It was as if he was lost in his own world right now. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was the way she had felt when she first met him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">All of a sudden, Grace's heart ached a little. 'What's wrong with him? Why do I have this feeling? Why does he feel alone? I'm clearly beside him!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay!" She called out his name.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His body suddenly trembled. He slowly turned around, his deep peach blossom eyes looking at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace instantly felt as if she had been hit hard in the heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes seemed to be misty and red. The expression on his face was indifferent, almost expressionless. However, she somehow had the impression that he was about to cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Jay, what's the matter? What happened?" asked Grace as she sped forward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His eyes rested firmly on her face. He suddenly hugged her with all his might. "I'm the one you love the most, and you'll always stay by my side, won't you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His embrace was so hard that it almost took her breath away. She also felt him tremble.</p></div>
