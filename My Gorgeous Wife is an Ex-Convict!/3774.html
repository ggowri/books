        <h1>Chapter 3772</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica hung the cat paw pendant on Mason's phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl at the booth watched this scene in a daze, feeling that the interaction between these two people was very natural, as if they had known each other for a long time.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is this person Mr. Reed's friend? It seems like their relationship is very good, the girl thought to herself.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you want to buy anything else?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, these couple pendants are enough," Veronica said with a smile, handing the phone with the pendant back to Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl at the booth was stunned to hear this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did she hear it right, a couple's pendant? Could it be that this woman and Mason are in a romantic relationship?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But how is that possible?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Didn't Mason just return to the country not long ago? And with so many people in school asking about Mason's news, there has never been a rumor about him having a girlfriend!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But the problem is... Mason did not deny what this woman said!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Couple's pendants, only couples would choose the same pendant to hang on their respective phones.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just as the female vendor was still randomly thinking about it, suddenly, a voice sounded, "Reed... Mr. Reed, hello, I am Mezera Ladd, a sophomore in the School of Economics and Trade. I don't know if the senior remembers me. We have met before. Today is the campus festival. I didn't expect the senior to come. You just returned to the country not long ago. How about I be your guide and introduce you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Before the other party finished speaking, Mason directly said, "I don't remember you, let alone need you as a guide."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" Mezera showed an expression that was somewhat unacceptable.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She has always been a beauty in school, pursued by many boys, including those from wealthy families, but she didn't like any of them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>First, she is beautiful, and second, her own family background is good. She is the daughter of the Ladd Group, and even her own value is worthy of Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Um... Mr. Reed, did you really forget? We talked before at the banquet held by the Reed family. My father is the chairman of the Ladd Group, and he has a good relationship with your father. I am well-intentioned and also want to make you more familiar with the campus."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, her father had already greeted Mason, asking her to get closer to him in school. If she could be with Mason, her future value would naturally be different.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Moreover, Mason's appearance is very attractive, and she naturally likes it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's just that Mason's cold attitude towards her is the same as before... Thinking about how she deliberately talked to Mason at the banquet in the past, but he always responded coldly, Mezera felt regretful.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>No man has ever treated her like this before!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But now it's not the same as before. She's even more beautiful than before and understands men's psychology better.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Your father and my father have a good relationship. It's their business, and you have nothing to do with me," Mason said lightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, his words did make Mezera lose face, especially in front of so many people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go," Mason lowered his head and said to Veronica standing beside him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh," Veronica responded.</span></p></div>
