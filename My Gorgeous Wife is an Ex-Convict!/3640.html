        <h1>Chapter 3638</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Jasper smiled and said, "Hello, everyone!" Then he introduced the people with him, "And this person is William, my sister's good friend!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So the children all shouted in unison, "Hello, William!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, my sister has brought gifts for all of you. Shall we all follow her and get the gifts together?" Jasper said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Great!" The children exclaimed excitedly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So, the group walked over to the front hall of the orphanage, where Jasper began to distribute the small gifts he had brought for the children, while William stood by her side and helped distribute the gifts.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger stood not far away, watching Jasper and William standing together.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The two of them standing together attracted everyone's attention and looked so perfect.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seemed like they had always been like this since they were little. Whenever William appeared, Jasper would always be by his side. As for Roger, no matter how hard he tried, he could only fill in as Jasper's lonely backup when William wasn't around.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, a backup is always just a backup. Once the main character appears, he can only stand aside.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This scene before him now made it even more painful for him to see.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger turned around and went back to the room where he was playing the piano earlier. This room was now empty, with only him in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was just like when he was a child, spending a lot of time alone in his room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>That feeling of loneliness seemed to be deeply ingrained in his bones. He used to think that he would finally no longer be alone, but in the end, he realized it was all just an illusion.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger's fingers gently touched the piano keys, and once again he began playing Transcendental Etude No. 12 Chasse-neige, the very piece of music that had introduced him to Jasper.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Afterwards, it became the piece he practiced the most.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Each note of this composition seemed to be etched into his very being, to the point that even in his dreams, he would be playing this piece.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The melodious sound of the piano filled the room, and a figure slowly entered, approaching Roger.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why, William, what brings you here instead of spending time with Jasper?" Even without turning his head, it was as if Roger had already anticipated who would walk in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>William stared at Roger with a deep and intense gaze. "I really want to know, who are you exactly?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As these words left William's mouth, the piano music came to a halt. Roger slowly lifted his head, his deep and beautiful eyes meeting William's gaze. He smiled, a smile that seemed both genuine and mocking. "Oh, so we were schoolmates and yet you still don't know my name?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is your name really Roger?" William asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger calmly replied, "If my name isn't Roger, then what should it be?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The answer to that lies within your own heart, doesn't it?" William said. "Your repeated encounters with Jasper weren't mere coincidence, were they?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't know what you're talking about," Roger said. "If you're trying to say that I intentionally created opportunities to meet Jasper, then you've got it wrong. It was actually her who intentionally created multiple encounters with me, accusing me of being someone named Lawrence. But fortunately, that misunderstanding has been cleared up."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, have we had any conflicts?" William asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Roger smirked. "That's even more confusing to me. I only met you after I got into Stanford University, so how could we have any conflicts?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then why did you go to Deer Capital and meet Harold and Camelia? Don't tell me you don't know who they are!" William narrowed his eyes.</span></p></div>
