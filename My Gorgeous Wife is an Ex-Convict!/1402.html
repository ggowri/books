        <h1>Chapter 1401</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"You... You had someone imitate my voice and recorded it, didn't you? You... You're so despicable!" said Paisley Daniels as she reassured herself that she had tampered with everything back then. They would not have found anything if they checked the hospital records.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace was just bluffing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace said bluntly, "Whether it's an imitation of your own voice, we can find out by comparing the voiceprints. Paisley Daniels, I dare to say this today because I have enough evidence to prove that you're not the one who donated the bone marrow!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Grace finished speaking, she looked at Martin Weiss again. "Martin Weiss, you think you're retaliating against Kyla to give yourself and the Weiss family justice, but Kyla is innocent. Perhaps you may never redeem yourself for the crime you've committed against her!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace turned around and walked out of the ward with Jason. Meanwhile, all of Jason's subordinates in the ward also left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss was in a trance. His mind was replaying the scene of Kyla Corbyn being forced to kneel on the floor while having her head pressed against it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had said... "Martin Weiss, I never knew I could hate a person so much. I&rsquo;ll hate you for the rest of my life!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She hates me! She hates me!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'If she was the one who donated her bone marrow to save and gave me a second life back then, then what&hellip; What I 'repaid' her with...'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could hardly bring himself to continue with that train of thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Martin!" Paisley Daniels said with tears in her eyes. It was as if she had been wronged. "How could Grace falsely accuse me like that? You don't believe her lies, do you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Only then did Martin Weiss stiffly move and turn his head to look at Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She still looked pitiful and teary-eyed like earlier. He would have gone up to comfort her if it were before, but now...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who was the one who donated the bone marrow to me? Was it you, or... Kyla Corbyn?" Martin Weiss asked in a hoarse voice as he stared at Paisley Daniels.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels was taken aback by the way Martin Weiss looked right now. His eyes were scarlet with a trembling rage in them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was as if he might come up to her and break her neck if she gave him the wrong answer!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Paisley Daniels unconsciously tugged at the blanket with her hands, trying to suppress the guilt. She said nervously, "Of course... it was me. How could it be Kyla Corbyn?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Was it... really you?" The words were almost squeezed out of Martin Weiss's mouth. "Paisley, you should know I hate being fooled. If Grace has falsely accused you, I'll do anything to clear your name even if she has Jason behind her! But... if what she said is true, then..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"It... It was me!" Paisley Daniels was so scared she immediately interrupted him. "Martin, you and I have been together for so many years. Would you rather trust an outsider than me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Martin Weiss slowly closed his eyes, hiding the redness in them. "Really? Paisley, I hope... you're telling the truth."</p></div>
