        <h1>Chapter 1678</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He was tempted to take a few more steps forward to get closer to her, but the bodyguard beside her raised his hand and stopped him again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Sean looked at the hand stretched out in front of his face. She was so close to him, but he could not even walk up to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Back then, he thought he could resist the pressure from his family and be with her. However, he destroyed this genuine and sincere relationship in the end.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Grace... I really did love you," muttered Sean. His hand was still reaching out, but he could not touch Grace no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Grace quietly looked at the 35-year-old man in front of her who was going through so many hardships.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Despite his words, her heart did not stir. "Sean, I wish you had never loved me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">With that said, Grace turned and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The bodyguard also followed Grace and left. Sean staggered and stood blankly in the same spot until he could no longer see her figure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'She said... she won't forgive me. She said... she wished I had never loved her!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had only loved two women in his life. He destroyed the love he shared with one of the women while the other dragged him and the Stevens family to the pits of hell!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the end, he was left with nothing! Nothing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Haha... Hahaha..." Sean laughed bitterly, clenching his hands at his sides while his nails pierced into his palms. He did it so that he could still feel alive!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In a nearby corner, Zoe Stevens put away her phone smugly. She had taken some photos of her brother and Grace together. In some angles, the bodyguard could not be seen. If others were to see these photos, they would think that only Grace and her brother were present.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">If she posted these photos on the internet, it would create a huge buzz. Coupled with the fact that her brother saved Grace... The netizens would learn about how the ex-boyfriend had saved his ex-girlfriend. The ex-girlfriend was leading a luxurious life while the ex-boyfriend was down and out. His injury also made it hard for him to make a living.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Such a topic was bound to create a huge buzz!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Many people would compare the Stevens family to the past, which would be embarrassing. However, she had suffered enough poverty in these past few years. She did not care about the embarrassment as long as she could get money!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">What she wanted was for the topic to go viral. Then the Reed family would &lsquo;repay&rsquo; them with a large sum of money for saving Grace's life!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">While Zoe Stevens was happily thinking about it and about to leave the scene, she was suddenly surrounded by several strangers in black suits.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"What... What do you want?" Zoe Stevens instantly felt uneasy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">One of them said, "Young master Reed said to hand it over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Jason?' Zoe Stevens was surprised. Pretending to be confused, she asked, "What? What do you mean? I don't know what you mean."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">They did not seem to bother explaining to her. Two of them grabbed her, and one reached into her pocket to take out her phone.</p></div>
