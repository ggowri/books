        <h1>Chapter 2954</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's alright, it's alright!" Camille waved her hand. "Just think about it, you saved me and recovered my huge loss. A meal is nothing compared to that!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After ordering a few dishes, Camille went to the restroom while Valda sat alone at the table. She sent the table number and restaurant name to Brian and continued to browse through the menu in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, a voice suddenly spoke up, "You are... Valda, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked up and saw a woman wearing a suit and delicate makeup staring at her, while a middle-aged man in his 40s wearing a suit stood next to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You are..." Valda felt that the woman in front of her looked somewhat familiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm Zelda Holmes, we were in the same class back in high school," the person said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda suddenly remembered that the person in front of her was her high school classmate.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I remember now, Zelda, hello," said Valda politely. They had an ordinary relationship as classmates in high school, but Valda recalls that Zelda's family situation was not good. She was thin and wore old clothes. Valda heard from classmates that Zelda's parents divorced and neither wanted to take care of her, so she was left with her grandparents to be raised by them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But looking at Zelda's attire now, it's clear that she's been doing well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't expect to run into you here," Zelda looked at Valda and then introduced the person next to her with a smile, "This is my fianc&eacute;, Ginger Bond. Ginger, this is Valda. We went to the same high school together. Valda's parents passed away back then, and she was living with relatives. Life was tough for her. I remember she used to collect empty plastic bottles after school to make some money."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda frowned involuntarily. Although she did collect plastic bottles to sell for money to buy art supplies during high school, hearing it from Zelda now gave her a strange feeling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ginger, since I ran into Valda today, why don't we invite her and her table to join us for a meal?" said Zelda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, as long as you're happy." Ginger said indifferently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, feel free to order whatever you want for this table. I'm treating everyone today," said Zelda with a smile on her face. However, her tone of voice gave off a sense of superiority."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No need, my friend is treating me today," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, don't be polite with me. I'm treating you, and it will also give you face in front of your friends. However, I still want to remind you about your attire. It's better to match your identity. Even if you want to pretend to be rich, wearing a limited edition knockoff will only make people laugh at you more. Please don't dress like this next time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Counterfeit goods?" Valda looked confused and didn't understand at first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"The clothes you're wearing are a limited edition from Chanel's spring collection this year. There are only 100 pieces in the world, and the official price is 2.8 million yuan per piece. I know you used to be poor and that's why you buy knock-off designer clothes, but at least you should understand that some clothes will only make you a laughing stock when you wear them." Zelda said with a seemingly kind tone, but there was a hint of disdain in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda looked down and glanced at the long-sleeved T-shirt she was wearing. She had stayed at Brian's villa last night, so the clothes she was wearing today were the ones Brian had bought for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because all of those clothes are from luxury brands, she specifically chose the most inconspicuous T-shirt, but this T-shirt costs a whopping 2.8 million?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda feels like her view on money has been shattered. Today, she's not wearing a t-shirt, but gold!</p></div>
