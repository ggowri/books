        <h1>Chapter 4223</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at the middle-aged woman in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I suppose you also know that I lost my memory, so for me now, Mr. Hunter is only my legal husband," she spoke.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler's eyes flashed with a barely perceptible sense of disappointment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It wasn't surprising that Tina would say this, as to her, he was practically a stranger now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when he heard her say it, his heart couldn't help but ache.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, you don't plan on having another child?" Adele asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I would only have a child out of love for this man, not because I want to cure an illness and have another child," Tina replied directly, without any other tactful words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele's gaze turned to her son, "I've said it before, why did you keep thinking about her and keep postponing the marriage? If you had married her when she reached the legal age, there wouldn't be so many problems now!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mom, please stop talking about this. This is a matter between Tina and me!" Chandler shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"How can it be just a matter between the two of you? If something really happens to you..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele's words were interrupted by her son, "I will live, and I will live well, so please stop saying anything more!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele looked at her son's pleading eyes. It seemed that Chandler didn't care about anything else as long as he could protect Tina.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had never seen her son look at her like that before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Even though her son was tormented by the curse, he never showed such a look.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She had always known that her son loved Tina very much, but since Tina went missing, his behavior repeatedly shattered her previous understanding of him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She only realized that her son's love for Tina was far deeper than she had imagined.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele finally just looked deeply at Tina and said, "Tina, even if you have lost your memory, I hope you can learn about your past with Chandler from others. In this way, you can let him live on, in consideration of the fact that he has loved and protected you all these years."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying these words, Adele left the ward alone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Only Tina and Chandler were left in the ward.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina looked at Chandler and said, "It seems like your family really wants to cure your illness."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You don't have to pay attention to what my mother said just now," Chandler said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is it really only possible to treat your illness with a baby's placenta?" she asked after a moment of silence.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"There are other ways of treatment, and I have had this illness for many years, ever since I was born," Chandler briefly mentioned, not wanting Tina to bear any responsibility because of it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina hesitated for a moment and asked, "So, do you also want me to have another child?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I just hope that you can be happy, joyful, healthy, and safe!" Chandler said. He had always wished for this, not wanting to burden her, fearing that he would constrain her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina, he had watched her grow up since she was born.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He had accompanied her all the way, from initially approaching her with a purpose, to later not wanting to confine her with that purpose, wanting her to live freely as she desired.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in the end, the one who became confined was himself!</span></p></div>
