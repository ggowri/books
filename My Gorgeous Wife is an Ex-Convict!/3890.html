        <h1>Chapter 3888</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um... how about you call me 'sister' again?" Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He frowned slightly, "Why do you suddenly want me to call you that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Because I haven't heard you call me 'sister' in a long time, and I miss it. After we get married, we won't be able to call each other that anymore, so I want to hear it more now," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, the time they spent as siblings was mostly happy, and those memories were precious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"After we get married, if you want me to call you that, I can do it anytime, there's nothing wrong with it," Mason said, looking deeply into Veronica's eyes, "Sister."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This 'sister' contained the affection they had for each other since childhood, as well as his intense and devoted love for her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She was his sister, but also the person he loved the most!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This will never change!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica smiled and responded softly, "Hmm."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Meanwhile, the photographer not far away was silently pressing the shutter button, feeling that the scene before him was extremely beautiful.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The man was supporting the woman's feet with his bent knees, and the woman was wearing a pure white wedding dress, looking soft and pure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The woman's hand gently stroked the man's black hair, with a smile on her lips. They looked at each other, with only each other in their eyes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was really beautiful!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A week later, after seeing the sample photos of the wedding dress, Veronica was surprised for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Many of the photos were taken without her noticing, but it couldn't be denied that they were beautiful and natural.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What should I do? I don't know how to choose," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Then don't choose. Print them all and make a book," Mason said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"...That's too many," Veronica quickly said, "I'll fix them and store them on a hard drive. I can also put some on my phone to look at anytime."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One afternoon, Veronica happily picked out the photos, especially some that she was particularly satisfied with. She even thought about printing them in other places.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Of course, these photos that she was particularly "satisfied" with were usually Mason's solo shots.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For example, there was a lazy solo shot of him. When she saw the photo, she let out a scream like a groundhog and exclaimed, "This photographer is really a famous one in the country. I heard that many celebrities want him to take their photos! You look like a big star in this photo. Oh my god, should I print this photo on a big pillow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Print it on a pillow?" he asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So when I hug my pillow, it's like I'm hugging you," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason frowned, seeming even more confused. "Then why hug a pillow? Just hug me instead."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're not always by my side, though. When you're not here, hugging a pillow is nice. It's soft, comfortable, and satisfying!" She used to not understand why fans bought body pillows of their idols, but now she kind of gets it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Being able to hug a body pillow of someone you like...that feeling...mmh...just thinking about it makes her excited!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Is hugging me not good enough?" Mason leaned down, his beautiful black eyes staring at Veronica with what seemed like dissatisfaction. "Or do you think I'm not soft enough and hugging me isn't comfortable?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"..." Veronica widened her eyes. No way, he's not...jealous of a body pillow, is he?! "Why are you comparing yourself to a pillow?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"You're the one comparing me to a pillow," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'm not!" she protested.</p></div>
