        <h1>Chapter 391</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He probably should have been nicer to her if he knew that she was this capable, but there was no use for Tony Cummins to regret it now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">After hearing her husband's words, Melinda Riley could not help but scorn. "How did Jason take a fancy to an ex-convict like her? It was Jason's fianc&eacute;e she killed!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How would I know?" grumbled Tony Cummins.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Hey, she&rsquo;ll probably be kept a secret no matter what," said Melinda Riley. "Unlike Evelyn who is official&hellip; Evelyn can marry into the Hart family. Wasn't it Evelyn who gave us the money for this trip?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Tony Cummins felt a little better at the thought of his youngest daughter. He could only pin his hopes on his youngest daughter now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason handed the phone back to Grace with a fierce look in his eyes. "What do you want me to do to your father?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">He asked her with a smile, but she understood the fierce look in his eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace knew that whatever she wanted to do to her father, he would do it for her once she told him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">However... "It's alright. It's good for me and him to end up like this," said Grace. What her father had done was only to kill the last shred of affection in her heart. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She thought her father would at least have some affection left for her mother. After all, her parents married for love, and her mother married her father at his worst.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Now she realized that it was only her own wishful thinking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Time was the worst of them all. No matter how in love they were, not a bit was left after so many years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason could not help frowning. She lowered her eyes. There was a hint of sarcasm and sorrow on her gentle face. It was as if something was slipping through her body and he could not grasp it no matter what.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, almost unconsciously, he held her in his arms, trying to hold on to her. Now that she was warming up to him, he did not want to let her go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace stood still for a moment, feeling herself falling into his wide embrace. A moment later, he held her body with his hands so tightly that she was almost out of breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Jason..." She could not help but cry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her voice made him tremble, and he loosened his arms slightly. However, he still held her in his arms and did not let go.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Call me Jay. I love hearing you call me Jay," he muttered. With a touch of hoarseness, his elegant voice traveled through her eardrum and crept into her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She pursed her lips and seemed a little hesitant, but at last, she uttered, "Jay."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">There was a smile on the corners of his mouth. "That sounds so good."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">She stared at the smile on his face incredulously. A simple cry from her could make him happy and satisfied.</p></div>
