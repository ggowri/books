        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley gently placed her hand on the back of his, "Don't worry, I'll be fine. If she plans to hurt me again, you can deal with her then."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright." He finally agreed, slowly loosening his grip.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl looked on in shock at the scene before her. The fierce expression that Calvert had just shown her had transformed into shyness and caution when he faced someone else.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This was just like two people.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Who on earth was this woman?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Did Calvert have such a woman by his side?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The previous news only mentioned that Calvert seemed to be involved in a scandal with a princess of the entertainment industry. Could it have been...</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The girl's pupils suddenly contracted, staring at Harley in disbelief.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that this woman standing before me is the princess of the Hart family? The one rumored to have such influence that if she stomps her foot, the entire domestic entertainment industry would </span><span>shake?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Would such a person really accompany Calvert to do this kind of "catching thieves" trivial matter?</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, the doorbell rang.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley chuckled, "Ah, the cops are here!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright, the police are here now. I'm sure you can have a good chat with them about what exactly happened. Of course, you might want to find a lawyer quickly, because this matter </span><span>definitely won't</span><span> be settled so easily!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In an instant, a chill surged up the girl's spine!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The police investigation results came out quickly. The girl had learned the entrance code from a cleaner who worked for Calvert. This cleaner was someone Calvert knew from the slums where he used to live. Seeing that she was poor and looking for work, Calvert had hired her to help with the cleaning.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But what Calvert didn't expect was that this person not only stole some stuff from his house to sell but even sold his address and passwords for a high price!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Of course, the police quickly detained her and managed to recover most of the items she had sold off.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Looking at the items returned by the police, Harley turned to Calvert, speechless, "Didn't you realize so many things were missing from your house?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I didn't really notice," he replied. Meeting her gaze, he added, "Actually, I did notice that some things were missing, but I didn't pay much attention to it."</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know that the cleaning staff stole stuff from your house?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"</span><span>Mhm</span><span>, I know," he responded.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why didn't you call the police, or at least try to get your stuff back from her?"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I figured it wasn't anything important, maybe she's having financial troubles, that's why she did what she did..." He said, his head bowed and his voice low.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He looked as if he had done something wrong and was patiently waiting for criticism and punishment.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley sighed, cupping Calvert's face, making him look up at her. "The one who's doing wrong now is that person, not you. Well, you're not entirely blameless either. Do you know what indulgence is? Because when you first noticed it, you didn't stop it immediately. This has only emboldened some people to push their limits. By doing this, you're </span><span>actually indulging</span><span> in malice. And the result of indulgence is that one day, it will come back to bite you!"</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm sorry," Calvert said with remorse.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What are you apologizing to me for? You should be sorry for yourself. If you plan on continuing to let things slide like this, then you better be prepared for the backlash. What if I </span><span>hadn't shown up today and this girl had her way? What were you planning to do? Let her blackmail you and control you forever?" she said.</span></p></div>
