        <h1>Chapter 1134</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When they got to the car, Brian put her on the passenger seat and strapped her in. He got back in the driver's seat and started the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car headed to Grace's rental house. On the way, Brian bought ointment to relieve the bruises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It'll be alright without the ointment. It's just a couple of scratches, and they&rsquo;ll go away in a couple of days. It's no big deal," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing about you is a small deal for me," he said. As if to prevent her from not applying the ointment, he pulled over at the roadside and took her scratched arm, wanting to apply ointment on the wounds.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I'll do it myself!" She quickly took the ointment from his hand and opened the lid. She dipped some of the ointment on her fingers and smeared it on the bruises.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cooling ointment worked its way through the skin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were only a few bruises, and Grace finished applying the ointment in a short time. As Grace closed the lid of the ointment, she heard Brian's voice. "If it&rsquo;s Stella who hurt you, I&rsquo;ll get you justice." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace looked at Brian in surprise. "You..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian said, "Stella saved my life when I was a child. She's indeed important to me, and I hope this incident has nothing to do with her. But that doesn't mean I don't know right from wrong. Besides, you're the one I want to cherish the most. I don't want you to be wronged no matter what."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's nose suddenly felt a little sore. His voice was calm. There was not even much fluctuation in his tone, but it gave her some strength as if hearing him say this would give her some peace of mind and warmth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car started up again, Grace looked at the ointment in her hand and fell into a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella was terrified. Robert Brewer had been sent to the hospital for treatment while Brian was accompanying Grace to the police station to give their statements.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was more afraid of being found out that she had framed Grace than the embarrassment of people seeing her awful photos from the past.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'It should be alright!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Robert Brewer was drugged. They probably won't trace it back to me. Besides, I paid a cleaner to lock the lounge door and unlock it quietly. As long as the cleaner doesn&rsquo;t tell on me, they won't be able to trace it to me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides, everyone had seen her photos because of this incident. Speaking of which, she was also a victim!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Nevertheless, Stella went to Brian's house in the evening and waited until Brian returned. When he reached the living room, she immediately got up with a concerned expression and asked, "Brian, how is Grace doing? Is she okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian glanced lightly at Stella and got straight to the point. "Did the incident today have anything to do with you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella froze, feeling as if her thoughts had nowhere to hide under his phoenix eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I... I know it's my fault. I shouldn't have asked Grace to wait for me in the lounge, but I really don't know why that happened to Robert Brewer!" Stella put on a look of remorse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Today... Dazhu said he was coming to see me because he had something for me, so I told him to wait for me in the lounge. Then Grace came to see me, so I told Grace to wait for me in the lounge too. I thought that since they knew each other, it wouldn't be too awkward for them to see each other in the lounge, but..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Stella sniffled as she spoke, "Was Robert Brewer really drugged? Is someone trying to frame me? If... If Grace hadn't come to see me today, then I might have been in danger if I had gone into the lounge. Grace... took my place and was met with such an incident. Fortunately, she wasn't&hellip; You know... By Robert Brewer, or I'll really regret it!"</p></div>
