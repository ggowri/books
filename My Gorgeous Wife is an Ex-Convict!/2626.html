        <h1>Chapter 2624</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, let me know when you're free," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Brian left, Valda Theller only came to her senses when her phone rang. She could only hear Camille Strickland's deafening voice coming from her phone. "Valda, is the man in the restaurant today the fraudster boyfriend you mentioned?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh... I didn't say he's a fraudster," Valda Theller said as she rubbed her ear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Anyway, is that him?" Camille Strickland asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, it's him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you really want him as a boyfriend? Do you know his name? Did you ever get to know him?" He was a good-looking man, but she still thought it was slightly risky for her best friend to do that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're only pretending to date. It's not real. He must have some desperate reason. Besides, he said he wouldn't do anything inappropriate with me and told me his basic information," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you believe him when he said he wouldn't do anything to you? Have you ever heard the phrase 'don't ever buy a man's lies'?" Camille Strickland was afraid that her best friend was so naive that she was getting fooled again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller quickly reassured her, saying, "Yes, yes. I'll be careful. I'll draw the line immediately if he behaves inappropriately. By the way, how was your blind date after I left?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It was so-so. Anyway, we split up after the meal. What a small world. We ran into Raymond Bowman just like that. But his attitude to you today... Uh... Didn&rsquo;t you find it a little weird? Do you think he still has&hellip;" Camille Strickland speculated.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Still has what? Feelings?" Valda Theller chuckled. "If Raymond Bowman had feelings for me, he had so much time to speak up for me when I was ridiculed at school. He didn't have feelings for me back then, so do you think he'd have feelings for me after all these years?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille Strickland was speechless. After a long while, he said, "Do you still have feelings for Raymond Bowman?" She was afraid that her best friend got a fake boyfriend to avoid her feelings for Raymond Bowman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I don't have any feelings for him anymore. Even if I wasn't so sure before, seeing him today has assured me," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was shocked when she saw Raymond Bowman today. However, she felt relieved and found it funny instead of bitter hatred.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She found it funny that she had ever fallen in love with Raymond Bowman. Raymond Bowman was the campus hottie while she was only an ordinary girl.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They were even from different courses and had nothing in common. However, Raymond Bowman had suddenly approached her, asked her out, and gave her gifts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she had been smarter, she would have realized that he never liked her. He was usually distracted when they went out for dates, and the presents he gave her were never what she liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It would have been fine if that happened once or twice, but it was every time. It was obvious that he was never even bothered to find out what she liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was immersed in the sweet dream of becoming Cinderella, thinking that she would be as lucky as the female protagonists in those romance comics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, she was proven to be nothing more than a minor character.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was in the corner of the library when she heard him telling someone else... "You dared me to pursue Valda Theller, and I did. You found her irritating, so I helped you prank her. What about you? When will you be my girlfriend?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This statement had shattered all her pride and love.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Alright, I want you to dump her in public and make her the laughing stock of the school. I'll be your girlfriend if you do that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay. Don't forget what you promised me!"</p></div>
