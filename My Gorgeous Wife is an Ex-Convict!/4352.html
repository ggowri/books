        <h1>Chapter 4350 Invitation Accepted</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Calvert Elledge," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who's that?" Karen quickly sifted through her mental list of the prominent Elledge family in Emerald City, but she couldn't recall anyone named Calvert.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's a student from our school. Last time he treated me to a meal, but due to some issues, we only ate half of it. So, today, I'm returning the favor," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You went out to eat with someone from our school? Just the two of you?" Karen quickly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, is there a problem?" Harley retorted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Karen was momentarily speechless. Wasn't there a problem </span><span>here?Harley</span><span> had just broken off her engagement, and then she had dinner with another guy. Surely, people thought there was a story behind this.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why did you agree to let them take you out for a meal last time?" Karen asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, Harley wasn't the type to casually accept invitations. In the past, many people had extended various invitations to Harley, all of which he had turned down.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley's eyes twinkled slightly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Why... Perhaps it was because of the carefulness in Calvert's invitation, or maybe it was the inferiority in his eyes, that made her want to accept his request.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley didn't want Calvert's self-deprecation to deepen, nor did he want to see the other party wallowing in self-pity.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I just want to say yes," Harley responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Calvert, standing at the school gate where he and Harley had agreed to meet, felt a bit nervous.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert didn't expect to get a call from Harley. She was asking when he was free so she could invite him out for a meal.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He originally thought that when she said she would return the favor last time, it was just a polite remark. But he didn't expect that she would actually do it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After what felt like an eternity, a melodious voice suddenly rang in Calvert's ear, "I'm sorry for keeping you waiting."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert suddenly looked up, and what caught his eye was Harley's handsome face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"It's okay." He quickly said, feeling his initial unease transform into a sense of relief. He hadn't expected Harley to actually show up.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Have you been waiting long?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, I just got here too," Calvert said. But he was lying. In fact, he had been waiting for quite a while.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"So, where do you want to eat?" Harley asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Whatever." He stuttered, still in disbelief that he was actually going to have dinner with Harley.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And what's more, it was Harley who initiated the invitation!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll choose the location!" Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Alright," Calvert responded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go get the car from the parking lot first," she suggested.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When Calvert climbed into Harley's car, that familiar feeling of inferiority surged within him again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This car was a luxury vehicle. Although Calvert didn't know the exact model, he recognized the logo. This car probably cost several million dollars.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Several million dollars was an astronomical figure for Calvert. It was perhaps an amount of money he could never have earned in his entire life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley drove Calvert to a fancy restaurant in the city center.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I've eaten here a few times and it's pretty good. I wanted you to try it," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Thank you," Calvert said, his head bowed.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In such a luxurious restaurant, Calvert felt out of place. Perhaps he shouldn't have accepted her invitation in the first place.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Coming to a restaurant like this only made Calvert see the distance between him and Harley more clearly!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As the waiter was leading the two toward a table, a voice suddenly rang out, "Harley, what a coincidence!"</span></p></div>
