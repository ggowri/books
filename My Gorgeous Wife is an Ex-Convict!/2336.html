        <h1>Chapter 2334</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you think I&rsquo;ll still be standing here and chatting with you if you had crossed that boundary?" Martin Weiss asked coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla froze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss grabbed Kyla and was about to leave when Chase Harper suddenly said, "Hey, Kyla's shoelace is still loose!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss looked down at Kyla's loose shoelace. Then, he crouched down to help her tie it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gasped, not expecting him to do that. She fell into a trance for a while.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His long fingers tied the shoelace for her, and the gesture caused him to have a deja vu.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, he had helped her tie her shoelaces just like this before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he had forgotten his feelings, it did not mean he did not remember them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What did I feel when I tied this woman's shoelaces back then? Was I... as willing as I am now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yes, I was willing!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The word appeared in Martin Weiss's heart all of a sudden.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was angry that she was talking and laughing with Chase Harper when he arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The woman had always looked distant in front of him, but she could smile so gently to Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What's so good about Chase Harper? He's just an ordinary man!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In his opinion, the man was not attractive at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not understand. Of course, he did not want to understand! He just did not want to see her smile at Chase Harper like that again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, at the sight of her untied shoelace, he got down on his knees so naturally. It was as if it was... the most natural thing in the world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if him crouching like this was perfectly justified!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the shoelace was tied, Martin Weiss got up again and left while grabbing Kyla, who was in a trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper was lost in thought as he watched the two figures leave.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Maybe... the friend Kyla said she was meeting here is Martin Weiss?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He had heard Nelson talk about his mommy and daddy getting married and having another child soon. Kyla's baby bump was proof of that.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, since they were already married, why was there a weird vibe between them? They did not look like a normal couple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'And Kyla's staying in a hotel?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is there something going on between them? Me asking Kyla out to help pick out a gift for Juliet won&rsquo;t cause a misunderstanding between them, will it?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper felt uneasy again at the thought of this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss took Kyla to the car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she got into the car, he pinned her to the backseat. "You and Chase Harper had better keep your distance. I have no intention of seeing the news of my wife having an affair with another man on a gossip magazine while we're still married."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla frowned as she tried to push Martin Weiss away, but her efforts were in vain, "I told you there's nothing going on between Chase and me!"</p></div>
