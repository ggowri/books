        <h1>Chapter 1501</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">All this while, he had thought that Grace was not compatible with Young master Reed. However, the moment Grace chose death, he started to respect this lady.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">It was not hard for one to fall in love, but only a few would be able to give up their lives for the sake of their loved ones.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young Madam loves you, Young master Reed! Even at her very last breath, she wanted you to live," said Terrence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's body trembled, and he said with a hoarse voice while choking up, "She loves me&hellip; Yes, she loves me! She really loves me! She loves me&hellip; But why didn't I believe that before this?!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Why? Why didn't I choose to believe her back when she said she was willing to forgive me not for the sake of the children?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He kept thinking that she did not really love him, or perhaps she did not love him enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, she ultimately used her life to convey to him just how much she loved him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Young master Reed, Young Madam hopes that no matter what happens, you'll still live. She loves you, and that's the reason she protected you by paying the price with her life. You must not let her down." At that moment, Terrence was afraid his boss would not think rationally after enduring such a shock.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Then, he heard a hoarse voice say, "Terrence, if I lose Grace, what's the point of me living?&rdquo; </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Under the moonlight, Terrence saw the stunning face of the man who had the most authority and wealth growing tense because of the suffering he was enduring. His dark eyes seemed almost lifeless, just like a corpse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Suddenly, Terrence had a feeling that if Grace really left the world, Young master Reed would become someone without a soul if he were to continue living.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina could not bring herself to believe that Grace had jumped into the sea. That day, they had been talking on the phone and even talked about the incident that took place during New Year&rsquo;s. Yet, Grace had vanished now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The police officers and Reed family were spending tremendous amounts of effort and had sent out many people to search for Grace. Nevertheless, they still failed to locate Grace's whereabouts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Even Martin Weiss had rushed to the scene and mobilized the human resources he had to help out with the search.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Lina kept telling herself in her head that her best friend would not die just like that. 'They haven&rsquo;t found anything yet, right? Perhaps someone has already rescued her?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, deep in her heart, another voice was reminding her that her best friend had fallen from the cliff along with her car. Even if her best friend managed to free herself from the ropes that bound her at the eleventh hour and left the car from the sunroof, the possibility of surviving was way too low.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'After all, if Grace is still alive, then why hasn&rsquo;t she shown up after so many days? And no one reported to the police saying that she had been rescued either.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The police officers and the Reed family were looking for her at the site of the accident. News of this had shaken Emerald City hard. There were high rewards being offered as well. Even the ordinary citizens of Emerald City had come to know about this news.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">On the other hand, Kyla and Nelson were anxiously waiting for updates on Grace's whereabouts. Every day, Nelson would ask countless times whether Grace had been found. As for Kyla, she could only reply bitterly each time. "They&rsquo;ll find her. Look, there are so many people looking for her. They&rsquo;ll definitely be able to find her.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Is Aunt Grace dead?" Nelson asked at the entrance of the kindergarten. There was a worried look on his small face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He had heard from the adults that there was a high chance Grace was already dead. Currently, the search was just to locate her corpse. Even though he was still young and was still rather muddled about matters regarding life and death, he still knew that once Grace was dead, he would not be able to meet her again!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He still wanted to meet Aunt Grace and wished for the day to never arrive. He still wanted to play with Aunt Grace and be a good brother to the babies in Aunt Grace's tummy.</p></div>
