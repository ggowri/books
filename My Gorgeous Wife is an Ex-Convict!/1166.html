        <h1>Chapter 1165</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Kyla Corbyn returned to the ward, the two talked with her for a while before leaving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once they were out of the ward, Lina could not help saying emotionally, "I never expected a kid like Nelson to get into a fight." After all, in Lina's opinion, the little one was the shy and quiet type. Sometimes, with a little teasing, the little one would easily turn red and appear shy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even a rabbit will bite when provoked. Besides, Nelson fought for his mother. Although he's usually clever, he's not afraid to fight," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was because she knew the boy was a strong hardworking boy. He had been deaf since childhood, and that made him more tolerant and patient than other children his age. Besides, he could speak fluently shortly after installing the hearing aid. He spoke better than many average children his age. Other than being intelligent, he was also hardworking.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everything was fine when such people were calm, but once they exploded, they would be ruthless!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace figured the kids who fought with Nelson were no better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," mumbled Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The two arrived at the hospital entrance as they spoke and got into Lina's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll send you home first," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, what's going on with you and Brian now? Are you really just friends?" Lina started to care about her best friend's love life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing's going on, but... we're not exactly friends either," said Grace. Only in front of Lina could she say what was on her mind. "I know Brian's interested in me, but I don&rsquo;t want to spend my life with anyone. I've rejected him, but it doesn't seem to work. Or maybe I should be harsher in rejecting him.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean you don&rsquo;t want to spend your life with anyone? Are you going to sacrifice your whole life for Jason?" Lina curled her lips and said, "In my opinion, you should find another true love and piss Jason off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace heard the name Jason again, her mind could not help but recall the figure she saw in Tianxiang Pavilion's private room. The way he had looked at her was so cold that it gave people chills.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She no longer existed in his eyes, and he had let her go as she wished!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Brian's pretty good too! He has had many girlfriends, but I heard he seems to have never 'touched' them, not even kissed them. There seems to be an expos&eacute; questioning whether Brian is 'incapable' and has problems in that area, but the scandal was quickly suppressed."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina talked about the gossip she had discovered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace said, "I just think of him as a childhood friend who had gone through thick and thin with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's now. Who knows what will happen later? Can you guarantee that you won't fall in love again for the rest of your life?" said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace choked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's more, Brian has the looks, figure, and ability. Do you know how many women are after him? Even if he doesn't have the identity of the crown prince, his face and figure alone can drive many women crazy. He was ranked first in the online poll for the dreamiest man!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina started to talk about all the gossip she had collected about Brian. Grace listened, and some of it really surprised her.</p></div>
