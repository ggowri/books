        <h1>Chapter 4305 A Difficult Problem</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The old Mr. Hunter looked at Tina intently for a while before saying, "Chandler is no longer with the Hunter family."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What?" Tina was stunned. "Then where is he now?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Quentin family," the old Mr. Hunter said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's body suddenly stiffened. "How did he end up in the Quentin family..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her voice stopped abruptly, and her eyes widened. "He isn't planning to lure out the </span><span>gu</span><span> worms right now, is he?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's his plan. I originally wanted him to go to the Quentin family later, but he said that since he had to go sooner or later, he might as well go early," the old Mr. Hunter said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then I'll go to the Quentin family to find him!" Tina said, about to rush out.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you know where the Quentin family is?" the old Mr. Hunter's words made Tina abruptly stop in her tracks.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She really didn't know where the Quentin family was.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The Quentin family was also a member of the Crypt families. Families like these have their mansions built-in hidden places and are not open to the public. Ordinary people would not know where these mansions are located.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just like the Hunter family's mansion, if it weren't for the engagement between the Stephenson family and the Hunter family, she wouldn't have known.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then, Grandpa, why don't you tell me where the Quentin family is?" Tina said. If Chandler can go to the Quentin family, then it means that the old Mr. Hunter should also know where the Quentin family is located.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I can't tell you,</span><span>" the</span><span> old Mr. Hunter said, "because I don't know either."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was stunned. "How is that possible..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Quentin family is one of the most mysterious among the Crypt families, so naturally, we only have a rough idea of where their family is located. To enter the Quentin family, you would be injected with an anesthetic and taken inside by the Quentin family's people while you're asleep," the old Mr. Hunter said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But aren't you worried that the Quentin family might inject something other than an anesthetic? Being injected with drugs has its risks, and if the Quentin family has malicious intentions, it could be life-threatening," after all, being injected with drugs carries certain risks, and if the Quentin family has malicious intentions, it could be life-threatening.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's why people from other families won't want to enter the Quentin family unless absolutely necessary," the old Mr. Hunter said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you want to enter the Quentin family, you need to get the consent of the Quentin family's people. If you really love Chandler as you claim, then find a way to enter the Quentin family yourself and stop him," the old Mr. Hunter said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina frowned and asked, "What if the Quentin family's people don't want me to enter?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"The Quentin family's people like to trade things and lives. If you have something that interests them, they will naturally let you in," the old Mr. Hunter said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What interests the Quentin family's people?" Tina asked again.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself," the old Mr. Hunter said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina understood that the old Mr. Hunter couldn't provide any further help. The way he spoke was actually a test for her, most likely to see if her love for Chandler was genuine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I understand. Then I'll go back first!" Tina said, turning to leave.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Adele watched Tina's departing figure with unease and looked at the old Mr. Hunter. "Dad, why don't you just give Tina something that interests the Quentin family so she can enter and persuade Chandler to change his mind?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, no one knows what consequences will arise from luring out the </span><span>gu</span><span> worms.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If her son ends up disabled because of this, then she...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Thinking of this, Adele felt an overwhelming heaviness in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If she can't even enter the Quentin family, it means that her feelings for Chandler are not as strong as she claims. Even if I let her in, there still won't be a result between her and Chandler," the old Mr. Hunter said in a deep voice.</span></p></div>
