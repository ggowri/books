        <h1>Chapter 3421</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After that, it seemed like Veronica was running into Daniel more often, sometimes on the school campus, sometimes on the playground, and sometimes in the library.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Sometimes, they just exchange a smile, while other times, Daniel would approach her and initiate a conversation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A bewildering feeling spread in Veronica's heart, something she had never experienced before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One day, when Daniel met Veronica again, he smiled and said, "I want to buy a pair of sneakers this Sunday. Um, do you have time? Can you help me pick out some sneakers?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Me?" Veronica paused for a moment, surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Yes, are you free?" Daniel looked at her with bright eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, Veronica suddenly didn't want her eyes to show disappointment. "Okay, I'll go with you to pick out a dress on Sunday," she replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Daniel's face immediately lit up with a sunny smile and he exclaimed excitedly, "That's settled then! I'll come pick you up at 10am on Sunday. Where do you live?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica shared her home address and asked for Daniel's address. She realized that they were in completely opposite directions. So she suggested, "Let's meet at the entrance of the mall. My home is conveniently located near a subway station that goes directly to the mall."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, let's meet at the entrance of the mall. Don't be a no-show!" said Daniel.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">At that moment, someone nearby called out to Daniel to play ball. He said, "I'll go play ball first. See you on Sunday!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay, see you on Sunday," Veronica replied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Watching Daniel's back as he ran away, Veronica's lips curved into a smile. Sunday...this was the first time she had a date with a boy other than Mason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A date?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When these two words crossed Veronica's mind, she paused for a moment. Was she...on a date now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On Sunday, Veronica woke up early and took some time to dress up, putting on her new dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">When Mason saw Veronica at the dining table, he was slightly surprised. He felt that Veronica was different from before, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what was different.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Stepmother Rosalind Bush looked at Veronica and couldn't help but ask, "Veronica, are you going to accompany Mason to the Reed family today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although Mason lived with the Barlow family, he still had a few fixed days each month to visit the Reed family. This was one of the conditions that Jason agreed to when he allowed his son to live with the Barlow family for a long time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No, I'm going shopping with...um, a friend later," Veronica said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Shopping? Do you have enough money? If not, just tell me!" Rosalind played the role of a kind mother at the moment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, she has been working hard to please and flatter Veronica. After all, the Barlow family now relies on Veronica to keep Mason hooked, which is why they are living the good life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I have enough money," said Veronica calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In recent years, due to the Reed family's influence, her relationship with her stepmother has somewhat improved. However, she is aware of her stepmother's insincerity and superficial warmth, which is only due to the Reed family's influence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason looked at Veronica and asked, "Do you want to go shopping with your friends?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mmm," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Which friend?" he asked insistently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hmm?" After a moment of confusion, she said, "It's Pamela. She called me a few days ago and said that it's been a long time since we've seen each other, and she wants to meet up and go shopping."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Pamela was her classmate in junior high school and they had a good relationship. They used to hang out together on weekends.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason didn't say anything else.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica couldn't help but silently criticize herself for lying just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Why did she lie to Mason? Maybe it's because Mason and Daniel had a conflict last time, so she instinctively didn't say that she went shopping with Daniel this time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll take you there. Where will you meet Pamela?" said Mason after finishing breakfast.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"No need, I'll take the subway directly to the mall entrance, it's very convenient. You can go back to your home first, I still need some time before leaving," said Veronica.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Mason left.</p></div>
