        <h1>Chapter 3293</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace looked at the debt collectors and asked, "How much money does she owe you guys?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"7.5 million, this is the promissory note she wrote!" Those people took out all the promissory notes directly, which had Wilona's signature and fingerprint on them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace's expression darkened slightly. 7.5 million is not a small amount of money for ordinary people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I didn't expect Wilona to lose so much money gambling.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona explained to Grace, "I...I just wanted to earn more money so that Lawrence could have a better life. I never thought I would unknowingly lose so much money! Mrs. Reed, please help me. You have to help me. As long as you help me pay back this money, I will do anything to repay you in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace naturally understood what Wilona was thinking, and she looked at Wilona coldly. Her icy gaze made Wilona's heart tremble.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"7.5 million, why should I help you?" Grace said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Well...well, but just now..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I just told Lawrence that I will help him, but it doesn't mean I will help him repay the debt. I can also ask them not to use violent means to collect the debt from him, but they can still sue him in court. Whether he goes to jail or not depends on the judge's ruling," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona's face turned pale instantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The debt collectors, upon seeing this, immediately started to curse at Wilona. "Mrs. Reed didn't even help you repay the money. You, surnamed Yuan, have really tricked us. You said you had the Reed family as your backing, which is why we dared to lend you so much money!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"The Reed family has never been our reliance. It was just that my daughter thought their son played the piano better, and my husband and I thought the child had a good musical talent. We didn't want to waste his potential, so we sponsored his piano lessons. However, the Reed family also sponsors many poor and underprivileged children every year. If every family that receives sponsorship says that the Reed family is their reliance, then how many people would the Reed family have to rely on?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Grace said these words to both the debt collectors and Wilona.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona looked embarrassed. She thought Grace would help her pay off some of her debts, but she didn't expect Grace to say something like this.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the reception room, Lawrence sat nervously on the sofa, wondering how his mother would react.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He was both worried about his mother and felt embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Especially when the servants were staring at him and whispering, he felt even more uneasy, and his cheeks were burning.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lately, it seems to have become the most difficult time for him to endure.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I don't know how long it took, but finally the butler led him back to the hall.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The people who were hitting Mommy before are gone now, only Auntie Grace and Mother are here.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just then, Lawrence noticed that his mother's complexion seemed even worse than before. She grabbed his hand and said, "Lawrence, let's go."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Oh." He stiffly responded, then turned to Grace and said, "Auntie Grace, my mom and I are going back. Thank you, Auntie Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Wilona frowned in dissatisfaction, but she didn't express her anger on the spot because Grace was still present. After leaving the Reed family, she muttered fiercely, "What thanks? She didn't even help me pay a single penny!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">In the evening, Grace told Jason about this matter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I had them sign an agreement where the Abbott family will pay the 7.5 million in installments deducted from their monthly salaries. Although it's a large sum, if they don't agree, they may not get any money back if Wilona goes to jail or declares bankruptcy."</p></div>
