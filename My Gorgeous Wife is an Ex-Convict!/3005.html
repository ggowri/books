        <h1>Chapter 3003</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After listening to what Brian had to say, Jason responded, "If that's really the case, then it's fine for you to handle it. Although the person in question is a relative of the Reed family, I have no relationship with them whatsoever."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why don't you just invite your relatives over and deal with it directly today? That way, I can save some trouble and Valda's teacher can also get out of this mess sooner," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You want me to call someone over here?" Jason raised an eyebrow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Isn't this your relative? Your relative has been using your name outside quite often, you must be aware of it," Brian said calmly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"......" Jason pursed his thin lips slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Reed, I'm sorry, but I really want to clear my teacher's name as soon as possible. He is truly a great teacher," explained Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace also chimed in, "Jason, why don't we just solve this matter today? The impact of these rumors can be deadly for a teacher. If we delay even for a day, it will only spread further."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason naturally agreed to his wife's request, "Okay, I'll make the call right away."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Jason didn't know how to contact this relative, so Brian provided his phone number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After Jason dialed the phone number of the relative, the person on the other end was pleasantly surprised when they answered and heard Jason inviting them and their spouse to visit the Reed family.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After the phone call ended, Yvo felt a bit light-headed and sensed that his fate might be about to change.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His wife Wendy was even more excited and when they arrived at the Reed family's gate, she took a photo and posted it on her social media, expressing that Jason had invited them to the Reed House.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Among my circle of friends, there was a lot of envy expressed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Wendy felt even more proud in her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">I feel like my family is about to become wealthy, and there will be many people who will bow down to us.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two people entered the Reed family. Along the way, they were amazed by the spaciousness and elegance of the Reed House.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But when the two entered the living room, they discovered that Jason and his wife were not the only ones there. There was another couple present as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This man and woman... Wendy felt that they looked somewhat familiar.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, we've been wanting to come and see you and your wife, but we were afraid of disturbing you. It's late at night and we suddenly came over, so I didn't have time to prepare a gift. This is a small token of our appreciation for the children," said Yvo Reed as he took out the hastily prepared gift. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not urgent." Jason didn't take them, but said calmly, "I heard that your wife was dissatisfied with the art teacher's fair treatment in order to make her child win an award. As a result, she even went to the education bureau and pressured the school to force the teacher to leave."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, Yvo's head immediately became hot and sweat dripped down his forehead. "This...this must be a rumor, a misunderstanding..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Misunderstanding?" Jason sneered, "Someone saw your wife pointing at that teacher's head and saying she would make sure he couldn't even be a teacher anymore!" </p></div>
