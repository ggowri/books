        <h1>Chapter 4275 He knew she had heard</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But matters of the heart are never fair," Chandler said, looking at Lornell now, he somehow felt a sense of familiarity, "Lornell, don't take everything for granted. If you love Harley, love her wholeheartedly. If you don't love her, then don't hold her back. Harley is a good girl, worthy of being loved."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell furrowed his brow, "Chandler, you don't need to concern yourself with what happens between Harley and me."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In other words, he hoped this topic would be dropped.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler smiled, understanding the unspoken meaning behind Lornell's words, "I just hope you won't end up like me in the future."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course, I won't be like you," Lornell said, "I won't sacrifice myself to fulfill others, and I certainly won't torment myself like you have all in the name of so-called love."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Chandler looked at Lornell's youthful face, but some things are easier said than done. If matters of the heart were so easily controlled, there wouldn't be so many unrequited loves in this world.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just then, Harley's voice came, "Lornell, come over here for a moment!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Lornell left first.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"By the way, have you seen Tina? Where did she go? She said she was going to the garden to get some fresh air!" Harley's voice came again after a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No, it was just Chandler and me in the garden," Lornell replied, his voice fading away.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina, hiding in the shadows, breathed a sigh of relief. It seems she hadn't been discovered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>However, Chandler, who was in plain sight, suddenly stiffened.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His face changed, and after Lornell had walked away, he surveyed the garden and suddenly said, "You heard, didn't you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina's body became tense. She heard Chandler's voice again, "Whatever you heard earlier, don't pay it any attention!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After saying these words, Chandler's footsteps could be heard leaving.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Has Chandler left?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina suddenly emerged from the shadows, but Chandler was nowhere to be seen!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The backyard was empty, with only her in it.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Tina returned to the hall, Harley approached her: "Tina, where did you go just now? Couldn't find you anywhere!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I was just taking a walk," Tina replied, her gaze instinctively searching the hall for Chandler's figure, but he was nowhere to be found.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley leaned in and asked, "What are you looking for?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Nothing," Tina replied uneasily.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If you're looking for Chandler, he's already left," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He's gone?" Tina froze.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yeah, it seems Chandler wasn't feeling well, so he left early," Harley said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina pursed her lips, thinking about his previous hospitalization. Her mother had said that ever since she went missing, Chandler had been tirelessly searching for her, neglecting his own health in the process.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Could it be that he hasn't fully recovered yet?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was absent-minded, her mind filled with thoughts of Chandler and the conversation she overheard in the garden today.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When the birthday banquet ended, Lina was about to take her daughter home when Tina </span><span>suddenly let go of her mother's hand. "Mom, I have somewhere else to go, You and Dad go ahead."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Where else do you want to go?" Lina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I have something to do, I want to go ask Chandler!" Tina took a deep breath and </span><span>said</span><span>.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Yes, she wanted to get some clarity!</span></p></div>
