        <h1>Chapter 746</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason wrapped his arms around Grace's waist and placed his lips slightly on her earlobe. "It seems Lina does say some nice things sometimes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What?" Grace interjected.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You chose a nice husband." As Jason spoke, he licked Grace's earlobe with the tip of his tongue gently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She gasped, blushing even more. "Jay..." She was starting to stutter a little.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"After a year, we'll get married right away," muttered Jason. 'One year. I'll wait for her for one year. One year later, I want her to truly belong to me.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He parted his thin lips and nibbled on her earlobe gently before sucking it, causing her to shiver.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Jason, don't..." She was now like a boiled shrimp. Her ears were so hot that all her blood seemed to be rushing there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it was as if he had not heard her. He continued to suck tenderly at her earlobe before kissing her on her chin, neck, and all the way to her chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blushed and could hardly look at his face. "Don't... Don't. What if the servants come in?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After all, this was the kitchen. If anyone saw them&hellip;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No one dares to come in without my orders," he murmured, and his kiss fell on her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, she felt her heart beating harder!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One beat after another, she could hear it all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace." He took her face in his hands, forcing her to look at him. "You know what? No one in this world will love you more than me, so just obediently stay with me, alright?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't go anywhere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Don't place other men inside your heart either!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Just stay by my side, keep me company, accompany me, and rely on me!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace panted slightly, her watery almond-shaped eyes reflecting brightly in the kitchen light. She looked so innocent that it easily reminded him of all his desires.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He could not and would not restrain his desire as the word slipped from her red lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loved her too much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He loved her so much that he wished he could rub her into his own flesh and blood. He wished he could trap her and let her eyes look only at him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was also because he loved her too much that he was afraid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He was afraid that she would leave him one day. Perhaps only when she loved him more and was more reluctant to leave him would it soothe his unease.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On the other hand, Lina held her phone and looked for gossip news about Lily's blacklist. She was commenting on and sharing the articles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was sparing no effort to step on Lily. Lily was so mean to Grace before!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, Lina also sent relevant news and gossip to some relatives and friends she knew, asking them to share it. She also sent a link to Hadwin on Messenger and wrote, &lsquo;Help me share this, and you'd better write a caption. PS: Please make sure it's more than 15 words.&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In a huge meeting room, the company's senior executives saw their president looking at his phone with a strange look on his face.</p></div>
