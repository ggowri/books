        <h1>Chapter 2961</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda didn't know how long she had been drawing for. When she finally put down her pen, she looked up and saw Brian sitting on the nearby sofa, watching her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"How long have you been here?" she asked nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I followed you from the beginning," he said, pointing to her words. "Is this the character design for your comic?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, we're introducing a new character and I couldn't decide on the design. But then I saw your photo just now and it gave me inspiration, so I quickly drew it," she said excitedly, hugging him and giving him a kiss on the cheek. "Thank you for the photo, your high school look is just bursting with inspiration."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her rare initiative was quite useful to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, could you give me a photo of you from high school? I'd like to carry it with me," she said. This way, she could look at it more often and perhaps gain more inspiration.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you like the way I looked in high school so much?" he asked, squinting his phoenix-like eyes slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, he looks really good, like the most handsome guy in school. And that kind of youthful innocence he had in high school makes me want to just jump on him."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you not want to pounce on me now?" His voice echoed softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused for a moment, uh, why did she feel a bit of danger?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked at his expression and said, "You're not jealous, are you? The you from high school and the you now are still the same person."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What about you? Do you prefer the me from high school or the me now?" he asked. Was he feeling jealous? Maybe a little. Even though it was still him, he hoped she would like the current version of himself more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course it's you right now," she said, showing some awareness of the situation, "I definitely want to conquer you now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"When do you want to make a move?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She blinked her eyes and his words... it was like a kind of seduction!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That... um... just wait a bit more," she said, sweating profusely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her with her head down and blushing cheeks, knowing that she was sensitive and sometimes couldn't be pushed too hard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although he wishes for a closer relationship between them, he understands the need to take things slowly and match her pace. He believes that one day she will be willing to fully entrust herself to him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his hand and gently pulled her into his arms. "Okay, I'll wait. But Valda, please don't make me wait too long, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The murmuring voice was like the most captivating whisper, making her heart race and immersing her in it...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the end, Valda not only obtained a photo of Brian from high school, but also photos from his middle school and elementary school years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda thinks that her next goal should be the photos of his kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">On Saturday, Valda said to Brian, "How about we go on a date today?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, how do you want to go on a date?" he readily agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She brought him to the amusement park where he had taken her before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As they stood at the entrance of the amusement park, he looked at her with a slight surprise and asked, "Why did you want to come here? If you want to play at an amusement park again, there are other newer ones you can go to." Besides, many of the facilities here are not suitable for adults to play on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I just want to hang out with you," Valda said. "Last time you brought me here, you mentioned a few experiences you had at this amusement park, and it seemed like they weren't very pleasant memories. Even the time you brought me here wasn't a great memory."</p></div>
