        <h1>Chapter 1202</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had a flashback to the scene at the hospital when she told Brian that she was the little girl who saved his life, but Brian no longer believed her because she had denied it so many times before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her denials were all because of... Jason, who was right in front of her now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The way things turned out was almost like an irony.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Taking a deep breath, Grace said, "Jason, what's going on between Brian and me is between us. I'm not here to see you either. I thought we had already made it clear at the beginning."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His eyes grew colder, and his fingers suddenly grabbed her jaw.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Ah!" exclaimed Grace. She felt a pang of pain from her jaw, and his face was so close to hers that the tips of their noses almost touched. It was so close that she could count his eyelashes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Grace..." His hoarse voice rang in her ears. "Have you ever regretted it? Do you regret asking me to let you go?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She immediately stiffened. 'Regret? Maybe I would have gotten back together with him if I hadn't done that. I was touched when he knelt at my feet and said he would trust me, love me, and give me his everything!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However... Even if they did get back together, it did not mean their problems were solved.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">They had always been two horizons. Now, they were just getting back to the way it was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I have no regrets," she heard her own voice replying.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next moment, the pressure his body gave out seemed so suffocating that she could not help shuddering.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Since you don&rsquo;t regret it, don't appear in front of me again. Otherwise, I won't go easy on you anymore!" Jason's voice rang coldly. For a moment, she felt as if he was about to crush her chin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace returned to her rental house, she was exhausted!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A lot of things happened today. Chase Harper, Stella, Brian, and... Jason... Everything seemed to be pressing on her mind, and she did not know how to deal with it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she had thrown up so much at Reed Group's entrance that she almost emptied her stomach, she did not have much of an appetite.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace thought about it and cooked herself some porridge. She reluctantly helped herself to it with some side dishes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">While eating the porridge, she turned on her phone to read the news. Since Lina had gone to Hadwin Stephenson's place, she would browse the news of tMason Swansonty where the Stephenson family resided.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when she came across a news story, she was stunned. The headline of the news was: [The patriarch of the Stephenson family is missing? His whereabouts are a complete mystery. Are hundreds of millions worth of orders about to be canceled?]</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Missing? Hadwin Stephenson's missing?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is this fake news or something?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a look at the account that posted the news. It was a verified account, but the news story had not hit the trending topics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There were all sorts of replies from the netizens in the comments below.</p></div>
