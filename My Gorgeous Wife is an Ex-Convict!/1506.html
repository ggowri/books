        <h1>Chapter 1504</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"This baby... was left at the security guardhouse. From the surveillance footage, the person who left this kid looks a lot like Secretary Wang,&rdquo; said the butler. Then, he could not help but add, "This kid&hellip; looks like you, Young Master, when you were younger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The butler had known Jason since he was born.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">He could still recall the time when Young Master was still a baby. Back then, his grandfather had been carrying him and they were at the entrance of Reed Residence.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that time, his father was always hoping that Old master Reed would accept his wife for the sake of his son. However, to his surprise, Old master Reed was firm with his standing and did not want Jason as his grandson. The old master even discarded his biological son as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that time, Old master Reed had left a comment, "You may bring your kid back home, but as for that woman, she can forget about entering the Reed family!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Hence, Young master Reed's father brought him away from there.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The butler glanced at the baby in his arms and it was like he was looking at Young master Reed from that year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason straightened his body, and his lifeless eyes suddenly widened. It was as if he had witnessed something that he found unbelievable. "The baby looks like me&hellip; when I was younger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">His hoarse voice was shaky when he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Yes, very alike," said the butler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's body trembled as he staggered to the butler. As for Terrence, he was panting to take in deep breaths. He was able to live through the crisis.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The baby in the butler's arms kept crying. The baby's little body was wrapped in a blanket, and its skin was pinkish.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'Is it possible? Is it possible that this is my child?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But&hellip; Grace is pregnant with triplets, why is there only one here? And what about Grace? Where is Grace, then?!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At that moment, Terrence's phone suddenly rang. After Terrence picked up the call, his expression changed for the worse. He quickly said to Jason, "Young master Reed, it's a call from Secretary Wang. He says he has something to tell you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason's expression changed as he quickly said, "Ask him to spit it out!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence immediately pressed the speaker button and Secretary Wang's voice was heard. "Young master Reed, you must've seen the baby by now, right? This is your child. The child has been in the incubator for more than a month. The baby doesn't have any illness and is considered healthy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'It&rsquo;s really&hellip; my child!' Jason's eyes reddened as he rushed to Terrence. He grabbed the phone and shouted at Secretary Wang who was on the other end of the call, "What about Grace? Where's Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">At this moment, it was only Grace whom he cared most about!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Do you wish to meet Grace?" Secretary Wang said, "Alright then, I'll send you an address. Come over."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">When Secretary Wang sent the address, Jason dashed out of the room with Terrence trailing from behind.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The butler just stood on the same spot, absent-minded. He glanced at the baby in his arms who was still crying. 'This child&hellip; is really Young master Reed's child!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But Madam was pregnant with triplets. Why is there only this child here?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason stepped on the gas pedal and drove at full throttle to the address given by Secretary Wang. At this point, Jason was not bothered if Secretary Wang had set up a trap for him. He just wanted to meet Grace as soon as possible. He was on the brink of going mad just to see her!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Terrence and the other bodyguards could only drive their cars, following behind Jason's car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Along the journey, Terrence was praying deep in his heart. 'It doesn't matter if only one of the triplets managed to survive. What&rsquo;s most important is that Grace is alive!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, when all of them arrived at the destination, they saw Secretary Wang standing there. In his hands were an urn.</p></div>
