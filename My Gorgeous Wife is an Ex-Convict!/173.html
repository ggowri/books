        <h1>Chapter 172</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He casually leaned forward, closing the gap between their faces. His cheek came in contact with her cheek, gently caressing it. However, the words that came out of his mouth next were enough to send goosebumps rising from her skin and bones.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"None of my business? But I am capable of finding out the answers if I want to. Should I let something happen to him? Then I&rsquo;ll find out the level of importance he has to you..."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace trembled as she glared at Jason. "What are you going to do? We're just pure colleagues. We do not have anything going on!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"But he has feelings for you, isn't it?" he mumbled as his thumb gently rubbed against her lips.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her lips abruptly felt heated as if the spot that came in contact with his thumb was about to go up in flames.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Don't... do anything to him," her lips trembled as she spoke these words with difficulty.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Does that mean you care about him?" His breath and voice had the power to lower anyone's defenses, but the gaze he had was so sharp that it could pierce right through her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No... Not at all..." She wanted to avoid his scent, but she failed to.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">It was as if his scent had trapped her. Not only her lips were burning, but the temperature of her body was also gradually rising as well.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Really? You have no feelings for him at all?" His lips gently brushed the tip of her nose as if he was teasing a distressed little animal.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace stiffened. "No."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He suddenly smiled. Even his eyes and brows curved upward as if they could smile as well. He looked so pure and clean yet so alluringly attractive. Such contrasting descriptions could only be used on him.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was dumbfounded. With such a smile, it was as if he was back to his old self.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You should remember what you said today and keep your words." His voice pulled her out from a daze.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">'He is not Jay that I used to know. He is Jason!'</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Gurgle.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Her stomach made a resounding protest at such a wrong timing.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">He was startled for a moment before he looked at the direction of her stomach.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That made her instantly embarrassed.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I almost forgot that you haven't eaten," he mumbled and released her from his hold.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace breathed out a sigh in relief, but then she saw him walking toward the table. He lightly touched her food container. "It has turned cold."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I just need to heat it up a little." She pursed her lips.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, he wordlessly grabbed her hand. "Since it has gone cold, then let's head out for some hot food. Now that I'm reminded, I once said that I&rsquo;ll buy you a good meal when I've earned a lot."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace felt her heart flip. Back when she first heard those words, she had felt elated. She had been eager for the day they would happily have a scrumptious meal together. However, right now... The same sentence left her a bitter aftertaste in her mouth.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Not allowing any room for rejection, Jason immediately grabbed Grace's hand and headed outside.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Terrence, who was waiting outside, immediately got down from the car and respectfully opened the car door when he saw his boss and Grace walking out.</p></div>
