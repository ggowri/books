        <h1>Chapter 2393</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was getting dark. Even though it was past the time to get off work, George Gregory did not move. He still sat in the leather chair at his desk, waiting quietly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Finally, his phone rang. "Mr. Gregory, I've sorted out all the information and emailed it to you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," said George Gregory as he opened his inbox and read the information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, his face turned increasingly pale as he read the information.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">There was not much information. After all, it had only been such a short time, but it contained what he wanted to know.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The ring finger on her right hand was... indeed gone!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Besides that, she had not been having a good time in the mental hospital throughout these years. Louise Mitchell would go to the mental hospital several times a month, but Amber Mitchell would &lsquo;harm herself&rsquo; every time after Louise Mitchell left and needed medical treatment. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The information did not state whether Amber Mitchell had really self-harmed or it as an excuse to explain her injuries. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, George Gregory was no fool. He could figure out what it meant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His phone rang again, and Louise Mitchell's gentle voice came from it. "George, when will you be back? I haven't had dinner yet. I want to wait for you to come back."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Go ahead and eat. I'll be late today," said George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the call ended, George Gregory looked at his phone and squeezed it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day, George Gregory went to the mental hospital and met Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the silent ward, he looked at the woman he had once loved with all his life sitting on the hospital bed while dressed in a hospital gown. He felt as though the two of them were worlds away. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">What shocked him the most was that her right ring finger was missing as if it had been cut off.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He asked with a trembling voice. &ldquo;Tell me how you lost... your finger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she only hung her head and made no reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse nearby said, "Mr. Gregory, she's been like this for all these years. She doesn't talk much and is immersed in her own world. You can&rsquo;t expect her to answer your questions."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory ignored the nurse and walked closer to Amber Mitchell's hospital bed. "Tell me how you lost your finger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell remained silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse warned, "Mr. Gregory, don't get too close. She's a mental patient and can be aggressive!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Yeah, she's mentally ill!' George Gregory told himself, but he still asked a mental patient how she lost her finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I shouldn't be asking her this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Or am I subconsciously hoping she isn't mentally ill? Or maybe I&rsquo;ve always thought that&hellip; she wasn&rsquo;t?&rsquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory thought as he raised his hand to get a good look at her face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She hung her head low with her long hair covering her face. He could not see her face at all.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she suddenly moved before his hand touched her hair. The next moment, she bit his right hand hard!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The nurse shrieked and immediately tried to pull George Gregory's right hand out of Amber Mitchell's mouth, but Amber Mitchell was biting hard, so the nurse raised her hand and started hitting Amber Mitchell.</p></div>
