        <h1>Chapter 3198</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Brian, you--" Valda looked surprised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the past, during weddings, there used to be a ceremony to show our respect to parents. Now, we will do it in advance," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, her tears couldn't be held back any longer and rolled down from her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He lifted his hand and gently wiped away the tears on her face. "Don't cry, your parents are still watching."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She sniffled and smiled with tears in her eyes, saying, "My parents will definitely like you as their son-in-law."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He wiped away her tears and together they turned to face the tombstone. They both knelt down respectfully and bowed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is... the greatest respect and gratitude towards her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I am grateful that they gave birth to Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I am grateful to them for protecting Valda with their lives during the most dangerous time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">If Valda didn't exist in this world, then his life would still be bleak up until now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kneeling is finished.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian and Valda stood up. Brian took Valda's hand and walked her to the steps leading down the mountain. He looked at her and said, "Let me carry you down the mountain. You walked up here by yourself and stood in front of the tombstone for so long. Your legs must be hurting now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A hint of embarrassment flashed across her expression. He had guessed correctly - her legs had indeed started to ache, but it wasn't too severe. She should be able to make it down the mountain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I have no problem walking down the mountain," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I'll carry you," Brian insisted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But my wedding dress is very heavy, it would be too tiring for you to carry me down the mountain," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian smiled slightly and said, "Don't worry, your husband's physical strength is not that bad. Besides, even if it's heavy, I want to carry it. In the future, when your legs hurt, I will carry you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He spoke and then voluntarily knelt down in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda finally lowered herself and lay on Brian's back when she saw him. However, even so, she still expressed some concern, saying, "If you get tired, please let me know."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," he said, but deep down he knew that even if he was truly tired, he wouldn't admit it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Because he couldn't bear to see her suffer from leg pain, he couldn't bear to see her walking on mountain roads while in pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And so, he carried her on his back and slowly made his way down the mountain. Even though sweat dripped down his forehead and he grew tired and exhausted as they walked, he still couldn't bear to put her down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She knew that, more than exhaustion, he felt a sense of happiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He felt really happy carrying her like this.</p></div>
