        <h1>Chapter 3084</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The servants talk amongst themselves about how deeply Mr. Hart loves this woman. Everything that belongs to her and remains in the villa is off-limits to others, as Mr. Hart personally cleans and maintains everything to preserve the way it was when she left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Once, a servant stole some of this woman's clothes with the intention of selling them outside, but Mr. Hart almost beat him to death.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">And there were also servants who saw Mr. Hart in the late night, holding a woman's clothes and crying incessantly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So, this woman became the legendary woman in the mouths of many servants.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many people are even saying how lucky this woman is to have caught the eye of a man like Mr. Hart. They believe it's a blessing that others may never experience in their lifetime.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was also curious about what kind of woman this woman really was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But now that I've seen her, I'm a bit disappointed because...this woman is just too ordinary. She seems like an average woman, or even worse than many ordinary women.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Because this woman has a limp in one of her legs! She has to walk with the help of a crutch!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I really don't know what Mr. Hart sees in this woman," the maid wondered to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, I understand," said Valda, with a hint of self-mockery in her eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So... Brian was really angry, right? That's why he left early in the morning and avoided her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda secretly thought to herself, feeling a complex mix of emotions rising within her heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Camille received a call from her friend and arrived at Brian's villa, she was stunned when she heard what her friend said. "You...you're moving back to your own apartment?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Uh-huh," Valda said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Don't you live here anymore?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, not staying here."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you have an argument with Brian yesterday?" Camille thought and thought, and this was the only answer she could come up with. But it didn't make sense, after all, Brian had been missing Valda, and Camille had seen it firsthand over the past year.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that Valda is back, Brian wouldn't dare to argue with her, let alone criticize her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda bit her lip slightly and didn't answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille looks left and right, "Brian, where is he?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda said, 'He left early in the morning.'"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille was speechless, so they really were arguing?!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But she thought for a long time and couldn't figure out how they could have argued. It's impossible!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What did you and Brian talk about yesterday?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing, really... It's just that he found out that I had actually been in Emerald City for several days now, but I just hadn't shown up in front of him," Valda lowered her head and habitually tugged at the hem of her long dress.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille can somewhat guess Brian's feelings. "Okay, he searched for you so hard, but you avoided him by going back to Emerald City. This is partly your responsibility. When he comes back, talk to him and say some kind words. I promise he will be fine. Trust me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille, I want to pack up and leave now. Can you help me move some things later?" Valda said. After all, she had many personal items, including everyday items and work-related things, that she left in the villa when she first arrived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now that we are moving back to the apartment, it's natural that we will also move these things back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Camille was startled, "Are you really planning to move back?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mhmm," she responded.</p></div>
