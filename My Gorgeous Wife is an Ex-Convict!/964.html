        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, I'll help you out," said Grace. At the very least, she could save Kyla some money, but... "However, I'm not sure that I'll win the case. After all, there are many unfavorable factors so far," Grace said truthfully.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I understand, I understand." Kyla repeatedly said. These unfavorable factors were part of the past she could not change. She was just grateful enough that Grace could help her with this lawsuit! "Thank you, Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"By the way, are you staying in Emerald City for now? Have you confirmed Nelson's kindergarten?" Grace was reminded of this. After all, as far as she knew, Nelson was looking forward to going to kindergarten.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Not yet." Kyla's joy turned to worry. She had been trying to enroll her son in many ordinary private kindergartens. However, once they learned that he was deaf, they refused even though she repeatedly insisted that he wore a hearing aid and could communicate perfectly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace mused about it. "I'll see what I can do."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is there something you can do?" Kyla was shocked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll ask my friend. Maybe there's a way," Grace said as her eyes fell on Nelson who was still sound asleep.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only kindergarten for now, but the people and things a deaf child would face might be crueler than he imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She only wanted to protect the child's innocence. It was because when she went into the small restaurant for noodles back then, the child had given her such a beautiful smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She might never have children of her own in this life, so she might as well just put her love into this child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Martin? Martin!" A soft voice rang in Martin Weiss's ears, interrupting his trance. "What came over you? What's on your mind?" Paisley Daniels asked. His mind had been wandering a lot since he came back from Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Though he went to her house afterward and apologized to her parents, saying that they would announce their wedding date at another suitable date, her uneasiness somehow grew stronger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At Martin Weiss's silence, Paisley Daniels continued saying, "Aren't we getting married soon? If anything is bothering you, you can tell me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stared at the person in front of him. She was the woman he had sworn to cherish for the rest of his life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though his feelings for her were more of gratefulness, he would marry her if it was what she wanted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Have you... ever thought about having a child?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels shuddered a little, then said sulkily, "You know I'm physically incapable of conceiving."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What if I bring home a child and we raise it together?" asked Martin Weiss.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you mean adopting a child at the orphanage after we get married?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, I have a child. A son." Martin Weiss revealed the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Paisley Daniels was completely stunned. &lsquo;A son? When did he have a son? Why don&rsquo;t I know anything about it?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, her eyes widened as she thought of a possibility. 'No&hellip; No way...'</p></div>
