        <h1>Chapter 2666</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It reassured her slightly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew that without Brian's help, it would take more time for the incident to calm down.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian spent most of his time in the serviced apartment she rented on their scheduled dates.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He would sit and read a book or watch a TV show. Meanwhile, she would draw him on a sketchpad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If she was quick, she could finish drawing in 15 minutes. If she was slow, she would take more than half an hour.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She often liked to draw close-ups of his face. His delicate facial features and indifferent vibe made people find him icy, but his phoenix eyes seemed to contain various emotions when they seemed to be cold. It made others want to take a good look at them.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, the more one wanted to see, the more one could not.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The contradictory feeling was increasingly appealing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was casually watching a reality show that recorded the true happenings in the emergency room on TV while Valda Theller was drawing Brian on a sketchpad.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller wanted to watch the emergency room reality show because the female protagonist of her new comic was an emergency room doctor, so she was watching the show to find out more about things related to the emergency room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had been watching it alone in her room when Brian came and joined in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Although she drew close-ups of his face on her sketchpad later, she also listened to what was happening on the TV.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the show, a mother and son were pinned down by the collapse of a house. After they were rescued and treated by the doctor, the mother and son were in critical condition. They only had a survival rate of 50 percent. There would be many after-effects even if they were saved. They could save the mother's leg, but it would cost a lot of money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Money was a heavy burden for an ordinary rural family like them. In the end, the mother chose a relatively cheaper amputation operation and lost her right leg to save as much money as possible for her son's treatment.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sacrificing the possibility of saving her leg for a child whose survival is uncertain&hellip; There&rsquo;ll be after-effects even if the child does survive. What's the point?" The indifferent voice escaped from his thin lips.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He disagreed with the mother's choice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's because the mother thinks her child is more precious than her life. She's willing to take a bet with her leg regardless of whether or not she can save him. Even if the child suffers from after-effects, she'll accept it!" Valda Theller said as she stopped and turned to look at the screen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Is it worth it to take a bet with such a huge price?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller said, "Yes. At least I think it's worth it. If it were me, I'd be willing to bet all I have for a chance if my child were ever in danger."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Bet for a chance...' Brian was in a slight trance. Valda Theller's figure seemed to overlap with Grace in front of him, and his heart experienced a clenching pain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why would the two of them sacrifice everything to bet for their children?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Are children so important?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's the matter? You don't look very good. Are you okay?" Valda Theller said suddenly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nothing. I just don't understand why you think kids are so important," he murmured.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Maybe you'll understand when you have children of your own," Valda Theller thought about it and said. She could not help imagining what his children would look like.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'A mini Brian? Wow, I think he&rsquo;ll look adorable just thinking about it.'</p></div>
