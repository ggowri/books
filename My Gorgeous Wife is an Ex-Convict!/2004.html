        <h1>Chapter 2002</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah, she's going abroad for some time. It's good for both her and me," he murmured as his eyes fell on Lina's face, "From now on, you're... all I have."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">He brought her into his arms and took in her faint scent as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His mother going abroad meant that she had finally admitted her defeat and given up the fight for the control of Stephenson Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, it also represented an unbridgeable gap between him and his mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Their already fragile mother and son bond was now gone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina felt Hadwin Stephenson's body quiver, and his every breath sounded nasal.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">'Is he going to cry?' she wondered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Even though he seemed indifferent, it was his mother, after all. They had fallen out to such an extent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina raised her arms and held Hadwin Stephenson. "Hadwin, I won't be the only one you have. You have our baby too. And I'm going to give you a lot of children. In time, your mother will see that we're happy. Perhaps she'll realize that she was wrong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yeah," Hadwin Stephenson answered sullenly, his head still buried in her neck.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Also... Well, I won't laugh at you if you cry," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Who's going to cry? Do you think I'm three years old?" he asked hoarsely, and Lina gradually felt her shoulder getting wet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace was slightly surprised when Lina returned to Emerald City. "Why did you come back so soon? Why not stay in J City longer?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I came back to give birth. Besides, my obstetric record is registered in Emerald City, and I'm more used to the food here," said Lina. While she enjoyed the food in J City, she felt more comfortable somewhere she was familiar with. "By the way, are you free this evening? Hadwin and I would like to invite you, Jason, and the kids to dinner. Kyla is busy with her store this evening, so you and I can hang out at her place during the day."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Sure," replied Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">That night, Grace brought the four children to dinner&mdash;her three little ones and Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mason would not leave Veronica Barlow's side, and he would not come out without Veronica Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina was so envious when she saw the three little ones! Other people had to get pregnant three times to get three children, but her best friend gained three all at once. They were all so cute.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Lina had now turned into a weird lady, kissing and touching the three children. It made Mason reject her right away. Though Mick did not reject her, there was obvious reluctance on his face. Jasper was the only one who enjoyed Lina's kisses, which made Lina feel a little closer to her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You can kiss all you want when your baby is born," quipped Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I have four months to go!" grumbled Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Four months will pass in a flash."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The two women helped the four children with their food while they chatted, while the two men looked at each other. Hadwin Stephenson proposed a toast and said, "Thank you for saving Lina."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If Jason had not rescued Lina when Katherine Jackson kidnapped her, maybe he would not have been able to see Lina at all, let alone expect their baby to be born. He shuddered every time he thought of it.</p></div>
