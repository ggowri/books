        <h1>Chapter 2434</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace's heart melted at the sight of her son. 'I didn't give birth to my son in vain!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She could not help but lean over and kiss her son's tender cheek.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one blushed instantly. However&hellip; he enjoyed his mommy kissing him. It was just that he was embarrassed when Mommy kissed him in front of so many people.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace found her son even cuter when she saw his reddened face, so she could not resist kissing him several more times.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian looked at the sweet scene and lowered his phoenix eyes gently. 'Grace's happy, and I know that, don't I? But I still have mixed feelings after seeing it with my own eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'I... hope she can live a happy life but will regret that I'm not the one giving her happiness!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was 11 p.m., and Grace woke her son up. She let him sleep after dinner as their operation would take place much later. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Mick Reed rubbed his sleepy eyes and yawned, but his beautiful peach blossom eyes gradually gained clarity.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The little one knew what he had to do later. He opened his mini laptop, and his fingers began moving quickly across the keyboard.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The experts also took out their laptops and began the operation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason&rsquo;s and Brian's men also began to approach the mansion. They had also brought filming equipment with them to let Grace see the process of the operation. That way, they could cooperate better.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Mick Reed and the experts hacked into the mansion's security system and cut off the power supply, the agile bodyguards sneaked into the mansion and began the rescue operation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Jason and Brian worked together. One gave the instructions, while the other quickly calculated the best route.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace did nothing but watch nervously.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She thought Mick would be a bystander if she brought him over, but it now looked like she was the bystander instead. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The operation went smoothly. When the bodyguard rescued Amber Mitchell from the basement, Grace saw some new wounds on Amber Mitchell's skin that weren&rsquo;t covered by her clothes. There were definitely more wounds under her clothes!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">One could imagine that the Mitchell family must have hurt her in the past few days after she was locked up in the mansion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even now, there were bald spots on Amber Mitchell&rsquo;s scalp and visible blood marks. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Amber Mitchell, I'm Kyla's friend. I'm here to save you. We met in the hospital before. Do you remember me?" Grace quickly said to Amber Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The car began to drive in the dark. The most important thing now was to get out of here!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell's eyes were swollen. With difficulty, she looked up at Grace. Moments later, she said hoarsely in a voice that sounded like a broken gong, "I... remember."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was relieved to hear that. Amber Mitchell's eyes were red and swollen. She looked depressed. Her eyes seemed empty from the excessive torture, but at least they seemed clear.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We're going to take you for a mental evaluation. If it can prove that you're not mentally ill, you can be free. I don't know whether you're mentally ill, but I hope you can cooperate," Grace continued saying.</p></div>
