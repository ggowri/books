        <h1>Chapter 3753</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked coldly at her, "Why would I pretend? If the school really wanted me to drop out, even if I lied today, everyone would know the truth in a few days. It </span><span>would only be more embarrassing. There's no need for such lies!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Maybe you just love to lie!" Vanessa said angrily, "Veronica, don't think that you can avoid dropping out just by lying. Let me tell you, the homeroom teacher said that you will definitely be expelled!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Homeroom teacher?" Veronica was taken aback. The homeroom teacher was the toughest on her in the office just now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And now Vanessa says this, does that mean...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"When did the homeroom teacher tell you to make me drop out?" Veronica looked at Vanessa. There were rumors in the class before that the homeroom teacher had a good relationship with Vanessa and had even visited Vanessa's family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So was the homeroom teacher's hostility towards her just now related to Vanessa?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa's face changed, realizing that she had misspoken. She hurriedly tried to make up for it, "Don't change the subject. Anyway, you won't be able to stay in this school anymore..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But before she could finish her words, there was a commotion not far away. It seemed that many people were coming over, and some girls' voices could be heard.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Wow, he's so handsome!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do we have such a handsome boy in our school?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is he looking for someone?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"He seems like a celebrity. Is he from the entertainment industry?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These voices kept ringing in their ears.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa looked up and saw a tall figure walking towards them not far away, and the person's appearance was...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was the pretty boy who had dined with Veronica in the restaurant that day!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Vanessa widened her eyes, and all kinds of speculations filled her mind. This pretty boy shouldn't be from their school, but he actually found his way here. Great! She was going to make Veronica and this pretty boy lose face in front of so many classmates!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica looked at Mason walking towards her, and asked in a daze, "Why are you here?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you not planning to tell me what happened in your school?" Mason asked back.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Are you referring to...?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Since I was the one who had the driver pick you up and caused such a big rumor, shouldn't it be my responsibility to resolve it?" Mason said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Shirley, who was standing next to them, suddenly understood, "Veronica, this is the friend you were talking about, right?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, it's him," Veronica said, before she could introduce the two, Vanessa's voice came from beside them.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Oh, Veronica, are you afraid that the school will really expel you, so you deliberately found a little white face to stage a show for you? Are you planning to let the little white face pretend to be a rich second generation? Saying that the luxury car is his, he is your boyfriend, and he sent someone to pick you up?" Vanessa said loudly, hoping that everyone around could hear her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica frowned, "Vanessa, who is the one full of lies after all?!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What, are you angry now? Otherwise, let the person who picked you up before </span><span>appear, and we can confront each other face to face!" Vanessa said arrogantly.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to make a big deal out of this, to the point where Veronica couldn't handle it.</span></p></div>
