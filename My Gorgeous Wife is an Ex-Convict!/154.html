        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Even after touching her lips, he would use a clean handkerchief to wipe his fingers, as if she was dirty.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn was puzzled by his actions, but she dared not ask him about it.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You don't have to apologize to me. You're my girlfriend and you only need to care about me. As for anything else, you don't have to bother about it," Brian said.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His actions were gentle, as if he was stroking something precious. However, his voice sounded cold and aloof.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">At times, Evelyn felt that she could not understand him. She had no idea what was going on in his mind or what his desires were.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I... understand," Evelyn stuttered.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Brian withdrew his hand and, as usual, took out his handkerchief to wipe his fingers.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Evelyn bit her lip. She was determined to capture his heart one day and become his final girlfriend. She wanted to marry him in the future!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">That was the vow that she had secretly made to herself!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The holidays ended in no time. Grace went back to the Sanitation Service Center to work. Many of her colleagues had read about the news that someone had thrown eggs and vegetables at her outside the hospital, and they had started to gossip about her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, don't get us into trouble. What if someone comes to our Sanitation Service Center and throws eggs and vegetables at us?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That's right. My parents are worried about me because they know that my colleague is an ex-convict!"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Lily has so many fans. Back then, Grace knocked her sister down and killed her. Lily was close to her sister, and many of her fans felt sorry for her. I dare not imagine what other actions they might take in the future. It would be terrible if we got hurt because of you."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">The staff in the Sanitation Service Center spoke derisively to Grace.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">However, she kept quiet and shrugged it off. After all, she badly needed the job for her own survival. If she was dismissed, it would be tough for her to find another job.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Claire said to her, "Ignore these people. They can't wait to see you leave. It won't be easy to get a new job now, and even if you manage to find one, your new colleagues there will gossip about you too."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I know," Grace replied. She then lowered her head and focused on sweeping the streets.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Suddenly, someone hurried in her direction and knocked into her. She staggered back a few steps, almost falling to the ground.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">After the man had knocked into her, he left hastily without apologizing to her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Grace, are you okay?" Claire asked as she went over to Grace after seeing what had taken place.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"I'm fine," Grace said, shaking her head. Although the impact had been great, she was not injured.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"That man was so rude. He did not even apologize after knocking into you!" Claire said angrily.</p></div>
