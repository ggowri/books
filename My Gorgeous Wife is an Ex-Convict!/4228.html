        <h1>Chapter 4226</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina was surprised to see the woman crying in front of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But amidst the shock, she didn't feel repulsed. Instead, she felt a sense of familiarity towards </span><span>the woman.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Tina, I'm glad you're still alive. If something had really happened to you, I wouldn't be able to go on," Eugenia said while crying. For the past half year, she had been having nightmares, dreaming of the scene where Tina let go of her hand to let her survive, only to be swept away by the water.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Who are you?" Tina asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Eugenia paused for a moment and realized that she hadn't introduced herself to her friend yet, considering that Tina was currently suffering from amnesia.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm Eugenia Massy. You used to call me Eugenia. I was your best friend in college. You disappeared this time to save me! You have no idea how worried I was about you! Tina, my parents said you gave me a second life! Whatever you want to do in the future, I will unconditionally support you. I'm willing to do anything for you!" Eugenia said, tears and snot streaming down her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tears and mucus flowed from Eugenia's eyes as she spoke these words.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina couldn't help but think that Eugenia looked incredibly adorable at that moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't need you to do anything for me," Tina said, taking a tissue to wipe Eugenia's tears. "You said we were best friends in college?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes," Eugenia nodded.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Can you tell me about our college days? I don't remember anything," Tina said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Of course!" Eugenia immediately agreed. "I will tell you everything I remember."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After that, Eugenia did indeed come to the Stephenson family to visit Tina frequently, telling her all about their college days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She even brought many photos of the two of them together, as well as cosplay pictures of Tina taken during her college days.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"These are all your photos stored in this memory card. There are also some photos that haven't been printed yet," Eugenia said, bringing a memory card with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just when Tina inserted the memory card into the computer and opened it, she saw Kit in those photos.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Tina remained silent, not knowing what to say.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Seeing Kit stirred up a complex mix of emotions in her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She felt grateful to Kit for saving her back then, for being so good to her, and even for protecting her during the accident at the risk of his own life.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But at the same time, she resented him for deceiving her, for weaving a web of lies.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It has left her feeling confused even now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Back then, she truly believed that Kit was the person she loved, the father of her child...</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And in those moments of vulnerability, she developed some kind of special feelings for Kit.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Was it love? Or just a dependency akin to family?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She couldn't even explain it herself!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Back then, did I like Kit?" Tina suddenly asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, you did." Eugenia replied. She was unaware of Kit's deception towards Tina. All she knew was that Kit saved Tina and then she was found by the Stephenson family and the Hunter family.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that so?" Tina whispered.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"At that time, you and I really liked Kit. You were even more enthusiastic than me. When it came to Kit's concert, you always made sure not to miss it. You bought a lot of his merchandise and even got your dad's company to provide Kit with film and television resources," Eugenia said. "Just like you, a wealthy heiress, being able to provide resources to your favorite celebrity!"</span></p></div>
