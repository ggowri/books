        <h1>Chapter 1750</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Before long, he heard a burst of footsteps down the stairs. The people around him had all dispersed. The neighbors shut their doors, and there were no neighbors left in the corridor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Who... Who the hell are you?" Archer Barlow asked as he quivered.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason looked condescendingly at Archer Barlow and said coldly, "I'm Jason, Mason's father!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Archer Barlow and Rosalind Bush's faces were instantly full of shock!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">This ordinary apartment building was surrounded by a group of men in black suits. Many onlookers had gathered below the building, discussing and wondering what was going on.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">The fifth floor, where the He family lived, was quiet. A bodyguard stood at almost every staircase, and no one made a sound. People who did not know what was going on would probably think something huge was happening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">In the He family's living room, Rosalind Bush's hands were hurting like hell. However, she was scared to shoot her mouth off for fear of upsetting the man sitting on the couch.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Who would have thought that the child they adopted was Jason's biological son?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Gosh! One could call Jason half the owner of Emerald City. If she had known Mason Swanson was his son, she would have been nicer to Mason Swanson since the beginning!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">However, it was no use no matter how much Rosalind Bush regretted it now!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Of course, Rosalind Bush also did not expect that the woman she saw outside her home last time, who accused her of beating up Mason Swanson, was Jason's wife. She was the mistress of the Reed family and Mason Swanson's biological mother!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Veronica Barlow stared blankly at Grace, still digesting the fact that the woman in front of her was Mason's birth mother.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">She had always thought that Mason had no parents and was an orphan, so he would stay with her in the He family forever.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">'But Mason's parents are here now. Are they... going to take Mason away?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Thinking of how aunt Cummins had said she wanted to adopt Mason last time, Veronica Barlow got even more restless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">"Veronica, I want you to tell us exactly what you saw today when Mason was taken into a car." Grace's voice brought Veronica Barlow back from her trance.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Veronica Barlow quickly shook her small head. 'What am I thinking? We need to rescue Mason immediately!'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Mason's father looked tough. He must have a way to save Mason!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Therefore, Veronica Barlow hurriedly told them what she had witnessed while someone nearby methodically jotted down all the points Veronica Barlow made. They asked her key questions about the location, what direction the car headed, the license plate number, and what color the car was.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Another person turned on their laptop, opened a map, and started a preliminary search. "Young master Reed, the location where Young Master Ci was kidnapped has no surveillance cameras."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;">Jason narrowed his eyes slightly. "Keep looking!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10.55pt;"><span>&#8203;</span></p></div>
