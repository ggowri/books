        <h1>Chapter 792</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss was slightly surprised at her calmness. "Aren't you going to escape?" he asked as he pulled off his tie.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Can I escape?" she retorted as if amused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She had escaped. She escaped once when she got out of jail, escaped again when she saw him in the mall, but eventually... he found her anyway.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sometimes, fate seemed to like to go round and round and let everything go back to square one. It was funny and sad, making people feel helpless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"There's no escape." This was Martin Weiss's answer to her. "Even if you were to escape this time, I would certainly find you again."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Therefore, there's no need for me to escape." Kyla shrugged her shoulders as if she had given up all resistance and said, "Mr. Weiss, how do you expect me to pay the life I owe you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss pressed his thin lips together and stared intently at Kyla. "I wonder who helped you hide everything when you got out of prison?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Had it not been so, it would not have taken him so long.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A friend," Kyla replied faintly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What kind of friend?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"A friend to whom I could give my life!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Martin Weiss seemed to have mistaken the friend as a male.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, an uncomfortable feeling rose in Martin Weiss's heart. 'Since when could she give her life to another man?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're really good at flirting with men! What, was there a shortage of men in prison? Therefore, you could give your life to another man as soon as you got out? How does that man compare to me?" Martin Weiss said as he got closer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, Kyla instantly knew that he had misunderstood!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she did not want to explain herself. She had explained herself to him too many times, but every time she explained, it was only an insult to herself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Now, she did not even bother to explain.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, I can give my life to another man who&rsquo;s ten million times better than you," said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face was dreadfully dark!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was a long time before he finally said, "Was it you and his child that you held in the mall the other day?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla felt a pang in her heart. 'He did see me holding Nelson that day. However, he probably didn't see Nelson's face. Otherwise, he wouldn't have said so.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I've only been out of jail for a year. How could I have such a big child? I adopted that child. Is there a problem?" she said deliberately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Adopted?" he sneered, "Why didn't you have a child with that man? Why go to the trouble of adopting a child?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is my business. It has nothing to do with you," Kyla said as she turned her head away, afraid that he would see through some of her micro-expressions. "Martin Weiss, you might as well say how you intend to take your revenge. We can get this over with once you're done!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His brows furrowed, and those eyes that had always liked to chase his figure now looked as if they did not even want to look at him. 'How could she?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss stepped forward and immediately grabbed Kyla's jaw with one hand, forcing her to turn her head and look at him. "Look at me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her eyes met his with some stubbornness. "What are you&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, she had only opened her mouth and uttered a few words when his lips fell heavily on her.</p></div>
