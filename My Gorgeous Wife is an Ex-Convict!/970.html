        <h1>Chapter 969</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'What happened? Where's Grace?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The only person Chase Harper could think of was Elise Dean. 'I remember talking about Elise Dean's ring, and Grace seemed to be contemplating about it. Did Grace go back to look for that actress?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The more Chase Harper thought about it, the more likely it was, so he hurriedly ran back to the set.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">In the middle of several cameras on the set, Elise Dean was filming when Chase Harper suddenly burst into the shot and asked urgently, "Miss Dean, have you seen Grace? The one who came with me just now?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He did not see Grace when he came over, so he was panicking even more.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The film set was immediately in an uproar as soon as he intruded. Security guards rushed over and grabbed Chase Harper while the crew members started accusing Chase Harper one after another.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elise Dean was even angrier. "How would I know where she is?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The director asked the security guards to kick Chase Harper out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Miss Dean, can you tell me exactly where Grace is? Did she come to see you again? How else could she have gone missing without saying anything? I can't even get through her phone..." shouted Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elise Dean would not answer him, and the security guards were pulling Chase Harper away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a hand suddenly went past the security guards and grabbed Chase Harper. The cold voice sounded anxious. "What happened to Grace?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone was surprised when they looked at this person.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was Brian! The crown prince of the entertainment industry! He had always been cold and indifferent to the things around him, but now, he looked anxious.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Chase Harper was surprised too, but he could recognize the man who grabbed him. After all, one could always see him on online news or trending topics.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do... Do you know Grace?" asked Chase Harper in surprise.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What happened to her?" Brian asked urgently.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"She... She's missing." Chase Harper quickly explained the matter, "I came here with her today to look for Elise Dean. I thought that maybe Grace came up with some new clues, so she came back to look for her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned. 'If she has just been gone temporarily, it could be for many other reasons, but this man says that he can&rsquo;t get through her phone.' This stirred a strong uneasiness in his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's phoenix eyes looked straight at Elise Dean who was standing not far away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone else's eyes were also on Elise Dean now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elise Dean turned extremely pale. She could not help trembling slightly. "How... How would I know where she is? I... I just went to the bathroom, and I've been filming the rest of the time."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Could it be that you harmed Grace when you went to the bathroom?" asked Chase Harper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Nonsense. Why... Why would I harm her?" retorted Elise Dean.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Because Grace suspects that you're the real culprit!" Chase Harper blurted out.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Suddenly, everyone looked at Elise Dean with suspicion. A hint of fear flashed across Elise Dean's face before she flared up in anger. "How can you slander me like that? I... I'll have a lawyer sue you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, how could Brian not see the panic on her face?</p></div>
