        <h1>Chapter 2357</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We can also have entertainment at home. Do you play mahjong?" Lina asked before quickly adding, "Yes, Grace can play. What about you, Kyla?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I know a little," said Kyla. She knew the basics, but she had not played with anyone in years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"We'll play mahjong, then," said Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"But there are only three of us. How are we going to play mahjong?" Grace asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Hadwin called just now to say that he'll be home earlier today. Counting the time, he should be here in a minute. That makes four players, doesn't it?" Lina said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Sure enough, Hadwin Stephenson soon arrived, so Lina hurriedly set up the mahjong table so they could start playing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson raised his eyebrows. "I didn't know you could play mahjong."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm known as the mahjong expert in our family. When we visit relatives during the new year, I'll step in whenever they're one player short." </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson could not help laughing at Lina's smugness. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, then. Let's see how good you are." As he spoke, he ordered the servants to take out a set of mahjong tiles.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina had bought the mahjong set when she went shopping. It was merchandise from a celebrity event. He thought she bought it as a souvenir, but it came in handy at such a time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was no mahjong table in the mansion, so the four started playing mahjong on an ordinary square table.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you win today, the money is yours. If you lose, the loss is mine," said Hadwin Stephenson.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"That's inappropriate!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah, that doesn't seem fun," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina said, "We'll bet on 50 cents, then. We can have fun, and there&rsquo;ll still be winners and losers."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Sure," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla also smiled and said, "Okay." She knew Lina mentioned 50 cents for her sake. Otherwise, with Lina&rsquo;s and Grace's current financial resources, they had no problem betting on more money.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin Stephenson only smiled as a reply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If outsiders knew that the patriarch of the Stephenson family was playing mahjong with 50 cents as the standard bet, their jaws would drop.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The four played mahjong, and the biggest winner ended up being Hadwin Stephenson. Meanwhile, Lina was the biggest loser.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh? Mahjong expert?" Hadwin Stephenson looked at Lina.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina's face immediately reddened. "Uh... It's been so long since I played that I'm rusty. I'll pay you ten dollars and 50 cents later!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, I'll transfer Kyla two dollars and Hadwin Stephenson three dollars later," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No," Kyla hastened to say.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must take it. You won the two dollars. Otherwise, it wouldn&rsquo;t be fun anymore!&rdquo; Grace said, transferring Kyla and Hadwin Stephenson the money on her phone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla looked at the two dollars in her account and smiled. Even though her two best friends had now married rich men, they got along just like before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps, this was what a friend was. Whether they were rich or poor, they would treat you all the same.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, a maid came in with Jason.</p></div>
