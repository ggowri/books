        <h1>Chapter 3014</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I really do prefer this beige one, it's not about being stubborn or anything. If I find a purple dress that I like in the future, I'll wear it too," Valda said. "Brian, I still think that we shouldn't use a dress to prove anything. What I really want is not a certain color, but your feelings for me. So..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She paused and looked deeply into his eyes. "If one day you really find yourself falling in love with me, please tell me as soon as possible, okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He stared at her, realizing that she was much more open-minded and transparent than he had imagined.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay! I promise you that if I fall in love with you in the future, I will be the first to tell you," he said in a hoarse voice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then... pinky swear, promise me that you won't break your word," she said, holding out her right hand and raising her pinky finger.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I won't break my word, I promise," he said, extending his own pinky finger and hooking it with hers.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">This was his promise to her, and he would never break it.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The Reed family's banquet was grand, attended by celebrities and big shots from all walks of life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Valda arrived at the banquet with Brian, she couldn't help but feel a little nervous, and her body became slightly stiff.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Standing next to her, Brian was the first to notice.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? Are you nervous?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," she nodded, "there are so many people, and many of them I've only seen on TV news or financial magazines. What if they come over and talk to you and I can't say anything because I'm too nervous?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Well, you don't have to say anything if you don't want to. Nobody says you have to talk," Brian said. "Besides, just think, maybe they're even more nervous than you. If that's the case, then you won't be nervous anymore."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Huh?" She was puzzled and asked, "Are they more nervous than me?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes, because you're my girlfriend. They'll naturally be nervous when dealing with you, and they'll worry that if they accidentally offend you, it's like offending me too," he explained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hearing this, she couldn't help but chuckle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Still nervous?" he asked her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thanks to him, she was indeed less nervous than before. "Much better," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As the banquet went on, Valda did see some familiar faces, such as Kyla and Martin's family. Nelson was playing with the triplets, while their youngest daughter, Trista, was being taken care of by Kyla's mother. However, because the child was still young, Kyla's mother took her to the rest area first.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda met Mason, one of the triplets, for the first time.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">That is a very beautiful child, but there is something about the child's gaze that doesn't seem quite ordinary. It's as if there is a lack of innocence and instead a sense of coldness and emptiness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, when faced with a slightly older little girl next to him, the little guy showed an absolute attachment, which surprised Valda.</p></div>
