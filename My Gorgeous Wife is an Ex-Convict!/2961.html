        <h1>Chapter 2959</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After returning to Brian's villa from the restaurant, Valda's eyes were constantly red.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong? Your eyes are so red. Are they uncomfortable?" Brian asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"No, it's just that when I think of Camille, I feel like crying a little," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Oriel cry?" Brian furrowed his brow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Camille has been really good to me, and what I have done for Camille is actually far less than what she has done for me," said Valda. "If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be where I am today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As she spoke, her eyes became even redder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He lowered his head and gently kissed the corner of her eye, "If only I had met you earlier, then I could have protected you sooner."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She closed her eyes and gently hugged him, "I really wish I had met you earlier."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it had been her who met him on the mountain that year, would there have been fewer obstacles between them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">But if you think about it again, how old was she that year? She wasn't even born yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Thinking of this, she couldn't help but laugh softly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What's wrong?" he asked, puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's nothing, I just thought of something... When you were in junior high, I was still in kindergarten. I don't know if we ever met back then." She opened her eyes and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Upon hearing this, he couldn't help but curl his lips slightly. "Maybe I really have met her before. After all, Emerald City isn't that big. But back then, I never would have thought that I would come to like this kindergarten girl so much in the future."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You must have been very handsome when you were in junior high," she said, imagining what he looked like as a junior high student.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you want to see some photos?" he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">As soon as she heard it, her eyes lit up and she nodded enthusiastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her hopeful expression was as if she was trying to please him. He led her to the study and took out a few photo albums from the bookshelf, saying, "These are some photos from my student days. Most of the other photos are kept in the main house."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She looked through the photo album and saw a picture of him wearing a school uniform with a childish expression on his face. However, he looked like he was only 7 or 8 years old despite wearing the uniform.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"This is a photo from elementary school, the middle school photos you want to see are at the back," he reminded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even the elementary school ones have to take a look," she said eagerly, her eyes almost greedily fixed on him in the photo.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">So cute, so pretty!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The mini version of him really triggered her maternal instincts, and she just wanted to hug the little him tightly in her arms. "Your mom is so lucky..." Valda exclaimed with emotion.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What do you mean?" Brian didn't react immediately.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Having such an adorable son, just looking at him every day makes me feel happy. Your mother must have hugged and kissed you a lot back then," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian's forehead creased with frustration as he thought about his past experiences. His mother used to hug and kiss him a lot, and would even call him cute nicknames like "little darling" and "little baby". This made him feel uncomfortable and resistant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Perhaps you and my mom will have a lot in common," Brian rubbed his forehead and said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If I had such an adorable son, I would definitely want to hug and kiss him every day," said Valda.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian began to sympathize with his future son, "What if it's a daughter?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Of course, if I have a daughter, I would dress her up beautifully every day, style her hair into pretty braids, and dress her in princess dresses..." She spoke dreamily, feeling that having a daughter would be like fulfilling her childhood dreams.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When I was a child, the way I wanted to dress up and the dresses I wanted to wear can all be realized on my daughter.</p></div>
