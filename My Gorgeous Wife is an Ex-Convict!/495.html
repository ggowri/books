        <h1>Chapter 494</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina looked like she had difficulty explaining it to Jason. She wished that she could hide the fact that she was a couple with Hadwin.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to have many changes to her life after they broke up.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">If it were not because her parents had accidentally found out about him, she would not have even told them!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I... Hehe... I was worried I&rsquo;d disturb him at work.&rdquo; Lina gave a random excuse.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re not afraid of disturbing Grace?&rdquo; Jason shot back.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina held her breath. Grace quickly replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of being disturbed by Lina.&rdquo; Then, she turned to Lina and said, &ldquo;If there is any issue in the future, you must disturb me. You are the most important friend I have.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina felt warmth in her heart. She replied and looked through the rearview mirror to see Jason who was next to Grace. &lsquo;His tone earlier... Um, he sounded like he was jealous? It made me feel like I&rsquo;m being envied.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;But the question is... Why is Jason envious of me? Because of Grace?&rsquo; That thought made Lina shudder!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was unbelievable that she was being envied by Jason who was like a king in Emerald City.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, it seemed to have happened just now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When the car arrived near Lina&rsquo;s housing estate, another car also drove into the area. Lina found the car rather familiar. Subsequently, she was shocked to realize that it seemed to look like Hadwin&rsquo;s car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, Hadwin also noticed Jason&rsquo;s car. He got down from his car and walked over to Jason&rsquo;s car.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina got down to ask, &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;I called your phone, why didn&rsquo;t you answer?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She fished out her phone to see that it was shut and sheepishly said, &ldquo;Erm... It&rsquo;s out of battery.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin took a glance at the car and asked, &ldquo;Why did they send you home?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&rdquo;About that... It&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; Lina dryly said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At that moment, the car window rolled down and Jason said to Hadwin from inside the car, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re her real boyfriend, then don&rsquo;t let others bully your girlfriend till no end.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin was taken aback. However, Jason had asked the driver to drive off before Hadwin could respond.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Inside the car, Grace asked, &ldquo;Did you do that on purpose?&rdquo; After all, Jason was not a nosy man. He would not usually say such things to anyone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Yes, I was.&rdquo; Jason admitted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But why did you do that on purpose?&rdquo; That was something she did not understand.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;To prevent her from troubling you again. Since Hadwin is her boyfriend, then he should perform his duty as a responsible boyfriend.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t find it troublesome at all. I only came to help bail Lina out. Besides, Lina helped me so much back then, so even if I have to do more for her, I&rsquo;m more than willing.&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s why I am jealous!&rsquo; Jason said so inwardly. He was jealous that Lina held such an important spot in Grace&rsquo;s life.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though he understood that this was a genuine bond between two women, he still could not suppress that jealousy brewing within his heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Grace, how important is she to you?&rdquo; he stared at her as he asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;Very important!&rdquo; she answered without hesitation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">&ldquo;More important than me?&rdquo; His tone was rather displeased.</p></div>
