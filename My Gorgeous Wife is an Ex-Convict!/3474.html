        <h1>Chapter 3472</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It can be the same, Veronica, just like you said. We have grown up and things are different now. Since you were able to treat me like a brother despite having no blood relation, why can't you treat me as a boyfriend now? I will love you more than anyone else in this world.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He looked at her with a strong desire in his eyes, as if he would be willing to give up everything if she agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt a sudden tightness in her chest, as if something was blocking her airway, making it difficult for her to breathe.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This is someone she once thought was closest to her, but now, why is this feeling of unfamiliarity so strong?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"In the future, please don't say things like this again!" she said. "I won't love you, to me, you're just..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before she could finish her sentence, his lips fell heavily on hers, kissing her deeply.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Suddenly, her whole body stiffened and her eyes widened in disbelief. It wasn't until she felt the pressure on her lips increase that she realized what was happening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She instinctively wanted to push her away, but then his hand directly grabbed her wrist and his arm wrapped around her shoulder, imprisoning her in his embrace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Kiss, becoming deeper.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica can only passively endure, at this moment, all her struggles seem so useless, in the face of his absolute power, she cannot move even a bit.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">I'm not sure how long it lasted, but eventually the kiss came to an end. Mason rested his head against Veronica's forehead, breathing heavily as he spoke softly, "Veronica, I understand emotions. I know that you are the person I love the most. So, do you love me too? Let's date, I can be your boyfriend and make you the happiest girlfriend."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Veronica felt stiff all over, her lips still burning, but her body seemed to be getting colder and colder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He slowly straightened his body and finally released the hand that was holding her wrist. His beautiful black eyes were full of anticipation as he looked at her and said, "Veronica, are you okay?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But in response to him, there was a crisp and loud slap.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His face was slightly tilted to one side, with a noticeable red mark on his cheek, while her palm was burning hot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Just as he was stunned and lost in thought, she suddenly pushed him away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Mason, I will never, ever fall in love with you, never!" Veronica shouted loudly. Then she opened the door of the private room and rushed out, almost colliding with the waiter who was carrying desserts.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The waiter looked surprised and watched Veronica rush out before reluctantly carrying the dessert into the private room.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Inside the private room, Mason stood still like a statue, without moving.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The waiter carefully placed the dishes on the table without saying a word and left the restaurant.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After a while, Mason finally made his way to the dining table. He looked at the desserts on the table and after a moment, he raised his hand and picked up one of the sweet treats that looked like a flower. He put it in his mouth.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He remembered this dessert that Veronica used to love. She would say it was sweet and delicious. But why did it taste so bitter to him now?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He mechanically chews, one bite after another...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It's very bitter, really bitter...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Some things can be very sweet, but they can also be... very bitter...</p></div>
