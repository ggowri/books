        <h1>Chapter 1011</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Elise Dean was taken away by the bailiffs while Grace was left stunned.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Does Elise Dean's confession have anything to do with Brian?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter seemed to be deep in thought.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace and Lawyer Carter got to the court entrance, they saw a Maserati parked in front of the court. Brian got out and looked up at Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lawyer Carter tapped Grace on the shoulder and said, "Thank Mr. Hart for me. Without him, this case wouldn't have been so easy."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">With that, Lawyer Carter walked down the steps, greeted Brian, and left.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was still standing on the steps, looking down at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian, with his chin slightly tilted back, looked at Grace as well.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some of the people who came out of the court seemed to notice this and looked in their direction.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace took a deep breath and walked down the steps toward Brian. Although Brian might not be a celebrity, he was easily recognized because of his identity as the crown prince of the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She did not want to be surrounded by onlookers along with Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Congratulations on winning the case today," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was stunned. 'He congratulated me on winning the case without even asking about it. Sure enough... He has something to do with Elise Dean's confession.'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't win it. Lawyer Carter did," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian smiled. "It's all the same. You won, right?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Did you get Elise Dean to confess?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He raised his eyebrows slightly. "Did Elise Dean say that?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's a piece of cake," he said as if it was something simple.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace had no idea what Brian did to get Elise Dean to confess. After all, this confession had ruined Elise Dean's reputation and she would never be able to return to the entertainment industry.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Thank you anyway," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you want to thank me, then come with me," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Where are we going?" she asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You'll see," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was only when Grace followed Brian there did she realize it was a small clinic. A sign at the clinic's door spelled out &lsquo;Russell's Orthopedics&rsquo;.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'An orthopedic clinic?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was thinking about it when Brian said, "Come, it may seem like a small clinic, but Dr. Russell inherited his ability to treat bones from his family. He just doesn't like the system and social interaction in regular hospitals, so he opened a small clinic by himself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why did you bring me here?" asked Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I want Dr. Russell to check your hands," said Brian as he held Grace's hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her fingers were somewhat deformed. Especially since her fingers were thin, so the deformed parts looked more obvious. "You must&rsquo;ve injured your hands before. I notice you have a hard time writing or picking up food with chopsticks."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Grace was surprised that Brian would notice such minor details.</p></div>
