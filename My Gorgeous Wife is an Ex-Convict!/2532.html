        <h1>Chapter 2530</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Daley Moss only said, "Let me think about it."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell nodded. It was all she could do for Herman.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">News that Louise Mitchell was the main suspect in Herman Moss's case quickly went viral in the media as well as online.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Reporters swarmed the Gregory and Moss families&rsquo; houses every day. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Some reporters surrounded the entrance to Amber Mitchell's house after finding out where she lived.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Facing those reporters, Amber Mitchell only said, "I believe we'll find out the truth, and those responsible for Herman's death will be brought to justice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">A reporter said, "Word has it that you tipped off the police to arrest your sister, Louise Mitchell. Louise Mitchell married George Gregory immediately after you were admitted to the mental hospital. If Louise Mitchell is sentenced to prison and George Gregory divorces her, is it possible that you'll get together with George Gregory?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was the question that netizens were most curious about these days.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Many even concluded that Amber Mitchell did that in an attempt to remarry George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Amber Mitchell, who was about to leave, stopped suddenly. She looked into the reporters' cameras and finally said, "George Gregory and I will never get back together. It doesn't matter to me whether he&rsquo;ll divorce Louise Mitchell. I just want to uncover the truth and get justice for Herman."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Two hours later, George Gregory heard what Amber Mitchell had said to the media on his phone. He was brimming with mixed feelings.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Never get back together with me? I should be the one to say that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Why should the woman who betrayed me say that?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was as if he had been dumped.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">'Is Amber Mitchell really trying to get the truth for Herman Moss, or is she up to something else? Did Louise Mitchell really play the role of the perpetrator in the accident as Amber Mitchell claims?'</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Gregory, the information you asked for is here." One of George Gregory's subordinates handed George Gregory the materials in his hand and left the office.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">George Gregory's expression became increasingly ghastly as he read the information in his hand. The papers contained evidence the police had so far, and all the evidence pointed to Louise Mitchell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Even though it was still in the prosecution stage and the case had not yet come to trial, the evidence was enough to let him know that Louise Mitchell was indeed responsible for the car accident.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He thought it was an accident, but it turned out to be his wife's doing.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">How much more was Louise Mitchell hiding that he did not know?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Louise Mitchell was still his wife. This was regarding a murder case! No matter what happened to Louise Mitchell, the Gregory family would be dragged into this!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The next day in the detention center, George Gregory looked at Louise Mitchell sitting in front of him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Why?" The simple question seemed to represent everything.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Yes, he wanted to ask her why she had done such a thing. He did not need to ask her if she had been wronged because all the information had already given him the answer.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Shouldn't you ask me if I'm okay in here? Shouldn&rsquo;t you tell me you'll help me get a lawyer and try to get me out?" Louise Mitchell asked as she looked at George Gregory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm only asking you why you did that. You didn't need to do that at all!" George Gregory said.</p></div>
