        <h1>Chapter 3351</h1>
        <div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">According to Lina, she hasn't even seen what her future in-laws look like yet.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Basically, those who come and go in the Stephenson family are just Chandler and his few henchmen.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">However, those few henchmen were all middle-aged men who appeared to be highly skilled martial artists. They showed great respect towards Chandler. According to Lina, there was one time when some kidnappers attempted to abduct Tina, but before they could even get close to her, Chandler's henchmen had already subdued them to the ground.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina and Tina don't know what happened in the end because Chandler immediately took Tina away.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Lina eventually learned from Hadwin that someone was planning to kidnap her daughter, and that this person was associated with a company that was in competition with the White Maple Group.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As a result, the company went bankrupt within three months.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This wasn't Hadwin's shot, it was Hunter's shot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This shows Hunter's strength!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"It's very mysterious. You can't underestimate any of the Crypt families. For families like ours, our strength is mostly visible, but when it comes to the Crypt families, you can never guess how much power they really have," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valda was speechless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"So, in the future, if you happen to accidentally encounter someone from the Crypt families, it's best to be cautious," he reminded.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Uh-huh," Valda responded. By now, she had finished drying his hair and set the towel aside. She took the initiative to wrap her arms around his neck and said, "Brian, how about we have another baby, a brother or sister for Harley, in a year?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">One year later, her body had mostly recovered, and she could become pregnant again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian frowned, "One child is enough, we don't really need too many children." When he thought about the pain she went through during childbirth, he would feel breathless.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">He still vividly remembers the feeling of helplessness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But I feel that having more children can make the home more lively," Valda said. "I know you're worried about the risks of me giving birth, but actually, my last delivery went very smoothly! And the labor time wasn't long. Usually, for a second child, the delivery time is even faster."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Brian was not convinced by Valda's words, "Although having many children makes the house lively, when you have too many, you will naturally have to divide your attention. So, are you planning to focus on me or on the children?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Of course, all of them will be released," she sweetly smiled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"But if we have more children, then you will have less time and energy to focus on me, right?" he said. Of course, this is also why he hopes to have fewer children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">After all, with four children like Jason, it's easy to imagine how little time Grace can spend with him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">The two of them have very little time for their own private moments together.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I promise that I won't put any less effort into you." Valda promised.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Really?" Brian's deep phoenix eyes looked at the person in front of him, with a burning gaze in his eyes. "Then prove to me how much you care about me."</p></div>
