        <h1>Chapter 2646</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just then, Valda Theller's phone rang. She answered it, and it turned out to be Brian. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your film's booting ceremony is being held at the film studio, right? I happen to be running some errands there today. Do you want me to pick you up later?" Brian said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't know when it&rsquo;ll be over, though," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Then call me when it's over," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay," replied Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Today was one of the weekly three dates she had agreed to go with Brian. Who knew he happened to be at the film studio too?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, running into someone in such a large film studio was not easy unless one had agreed on meeting at a specific location.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">People unfamiliar with the film studio's layout often got lost and confused.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller put away her phone after the call. Zhou Xinmia's eyes lit up as she said, "Did your boyfriend just call?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yeah," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Your boyfriend is so devoted to you. He's so handsome, thoughtful, mature, and rich. I'm so envious," Camille Strickland deliberately exaggerated her words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller laughed. Her best friend knew exactly what was going on between her and Brian. She said this on purpose to annoy Raymond Bowman and prove that she, the person Raymond Bowman dumped, had pursuers too.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman pressed his thin lips and said, "Valda Theller, what's the deal with your boyfriend? You didn't have a boyfriend a month ago but one just suddenly appeared. And you two are deeply in love?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's expression changed. "Did you look me up?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman did not deny it. He only said, "I don't want you to get fooled. Do you know that man?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Bowman, you don't want Valda to get fooled? What a joke. Aren't you the one who fooled Valda?" Camille Strickland said sarcastically.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Raymond Bowman turned pale instantly, and his arm blocking them fell.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His act of deception back then would always be a thorn that could not be removed. "I... I just..." He had not stammered like that for years.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Mr. Bowman, I&rsquo;ve learned from experience. I know that my boyfriend will never fool me. He's not you, and I trust him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The words &lsquo;I trust him&rsquo; seemed to cast him to hell. Raymond Bowman's breathing paused, and his blood seemed to freeze.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was June, but he was freezing!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller also met Gloria at the booting ceremony. Gloria was thinner in person. Although he was already 28 years old, he seemed youthful. He was indeed the perfect actor for the adaptation.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">After learning that she was the original author of the drama, Gloria smiled and said, "I'm glad that I get to play the male lead in this drama. I hope we'll have a pleasant cooperation."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Gloria politely extended her hand as he spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller also quickly extended her hand and said, "I'm glad too."</p></div>
