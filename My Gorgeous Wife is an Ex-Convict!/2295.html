        <h1>Chapter 2293</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Martin Weiss's face turned pale.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I didn't push you away because I thought that since you wanted a kiss, I would just think of it as repayment too. I hope you'll stop flattering yourself from now on. It's never going to happen between us!" said Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She knew how cruel and harsh her words were!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, things between them would only get worse if she was not harsh enough.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His fingers were so tightly wrapped around her arm that they almost sank into her skin and bones. His voice seemed to squeeze through his teeth. "So if I ask you to repay me by sleeping with me, you'll agree to it?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "If I weren&rsquo;t pregnant, then I'd agree to it if you asked. As long as you think it's going to make us even."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Even?" He gazed at her and said hoarsely, "Kyla, do you so badly want nothing to do with me?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said lightly, "Yes. I don't want my quiet life to be disturbed. And a lot of bad things happen to me whenever I&rsquo;m with you. You sent me to prison, and it&rsquo;s because of you I&rsquo;m pregnant with the baby now. If you hadn't gotten drunk and raped me, I wouldn't have gotten pregnant. I wouldn't have to worry about the dangers of childbirth. Speaking of which, I was kidnapped because Mr. Lambert wanted to use the incident to claim credit so that the Yu family would be safe. Mr. Lambert wouldn't have kidnapped me if I had nothing to do with you."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He trembled. It turned out... she had always resented him!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"If you still blame me, I can apologize. I swear I'll never hurt you again, but... I beg you, don't say anything about wanting nothing to do with me, okay? Kyla, give me one chance. Just one chance. If you&rsquo;ll just give me one chance..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said firmly. "I won&rsquo;t give you a chance! Martin Weiss, I don't want to get hurt again because of you. Your existence hurts me more and more, do you know that? What I want to do most is get away from you!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face almost turned ghastly pale. "In your opinion, have I brought you nothing but harm?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What else? What else do you think you have to offer me? Joy and happiness? Martin Weiss, don't you know it was you who destroyed my happiness?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His body shook. He could hardly remain still.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that just her words alone could turn him into such a mess.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He asked with almost all the strength he had left, "Do you really have no affection for me at all? During this time together, have I just been flattering myself?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I haven't had any affection for you since I went to prison."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Her cold voice wiped the last trace of hope out of his eyes, leaving only bottomless despair in those dark eyes.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Okay, you have my word. You don't owe me anything. We have nothing to do with each other. If anything happens to our children, I'll arrange for someone to talk to you about them. I won't appear in front of you, so... are you happy with this arrangement?" he murmured, and the hand that was holding her arm loosened slightly until... he let go completely.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It turned out that all his feelings were wishful thinking. He thought she could finally forgive him and give him a chance, but he was just flattering himself.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">All she did was to &lsquo;repay&rsquo; him for saving her and the baby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She still resented him for causing her to be kidnapped.</p></div>
