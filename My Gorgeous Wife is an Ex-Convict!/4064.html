        <h1>Chapter 4062</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> The next day, Tina wore a high-necked shirt to school. Eugenia took one look and immediately gave her a sly look, "Did you really have sex with your Chandler brother last night?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina gave her friend a direct glare, "Sometimes, don't assume things so easily. Also, you're a beautiful girl, and that kind of look doesn't suit you at all!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia was puzzled, "Then why are you wearing a high-necked shirt? It's not even cold today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Is there a rule that says you can't wear a high-necked shirt when it's not cold?" Tina retorted.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia rubbed her nose, "Sister, it seems like you're not in a good mood. Why don't you tell me what's bothering you? Maybe I can give you some advice."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina thought it was a good idea and agreed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Chandler's reaction yesterday kept her up all night.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had been so proactive, but he just left without a word. Was it out of respect or because he saw her grow up and couldn't see her as anything other than a sister, despite her being engaged?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Or maybe he had always said he liked her, but didn't truly love her?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "What do you call it when a woman makes a move on a man, but he still leaves her alone in the room and walks away?" Tina asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia widened her eyes. "Are you talking about you and Chandler?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "You know it, why do you have to say it so clearly?" Tina complained.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I get it, I get it!" Eugenia quickly said. "Are you sure the woman made it clear enough?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Very clear!" Tina gritted her teeth. She had already made it clear enough. If he still didn't get it, she didn't know what else to do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Eugenia thought for a moment and analyzed, "Either Chandler is old-fashioned and wants to wait until the wedding night, or he's just not interested in you, or..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Or what?" Tina perked up her ears.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Or he likes men!" Eugenia said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "Cough...cough!" Tina almost choked on her own saliva. "How is that possible?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "I'm just guessing!" Eugenia said. "Or maybe he's just not into sex."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> Tina remained silent, seemingly pondering her friend's words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> "By the way, aren't you supposed to be taking some COS photos this weekend? Can I come along? You have so many fans online, and I promised them some behind-the-scenes footage of you," Eugenia said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Okay," Tina didn't have any objections.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Taking photos of some anime characters in cosplay was just a small hobby of hers. At first, she thought it was interesting to dress up as her favorite anime characters with exaggerated costumes and makeup.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, many of the characters she liked were male, but luckily she was tall enough to pull off the male characters without looking awkward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She just took some photos and found it fun, so she posted them on her page. Unexpectedly, they became popular.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Fortunately, no one dug up anything about her family background, or it could have been even more popular.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">On the day of the shoot, Eugenia, who was supposed to follow and take some behind-the-scenes footage, disappeared while Tina was getting her makeup done. She hurried back just before the shoot.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tina, do you know what? Kit is shooting next door to you! Hurry up and take some photos. Maybe we can see him when he leaves!" Eugenia said.</p></div>
