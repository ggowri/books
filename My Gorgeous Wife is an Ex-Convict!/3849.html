        <h1>Chapter 3847</h1>
        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Miss Barlow, what should we do with them?" one of them asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica recognized these two men as bodyguards who used to be with Mason. She had seen them before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So... did Mason send bodyguards to secretly protect her? Veronica thought to herself, then said to the bodyguards, "Call the police and let them handle it."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"We... we were just chatting casually with Miss Barlow, what law did we break!" the leader of the thugs shouted.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>They hadn't even touched Veronica's clothes, yet they were knocked down by these two men!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes, call the police, we're the victims!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You should compensate us for our medical expenses!"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The thugs shouted one after another.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica took out her phone and said to them, "I recorded everything you said to me earlier. When we get to the police station, we'll find out who the real victim is."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After speaking, Veronica immediately dialed the emergency number on her own phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You bitch!" The leader of the gang wanted to get up and hit Veronica.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But as soon as he showed his intention, he was forcefully pushed down to the ground and cried out in pain.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Soon, the police arrived and Veronica, along with two bodyguards and the gang members, were taken to the police station.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>As Veronica and the two bodyguards were finishing their statements and preparing to leave the police station, they saw Mason rushing in.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Veronica understood that the two bodyguards had notified Mason.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I'm fine. The bodyguards you sent were very useful. Those gang members didn't even get close to me before they were subdued." Veronica spoke before Mason could say anything.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"You... don't blame me?" Mason hesitated, as he had not told her in advance about the bodyguards following her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He knew she didn't like being followed, as it made her feel like she was being watched.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But after what happened with Daniel, he couldn't just let her be like before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He was afraid she would be in danger again, afraid he would lose her again!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>How could he lose the treasure he had finally obtained?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>If he lost her this time, he would go crazy.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Why would I blame you?" Veronica said, "If you hadn't sent bodyguards to protect me, I might not have been able to escape so easily today. I might have been in danger."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"But don't you dislike being followed in the shadows?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"I don't really like it, and I'm not used to it, but compared to safety, these things are nothing. I can endure it," Veronica said. After experiencing what happened with Daniel, she naturally wouldn't look at things the same way as before.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>After all, if she had someone to protect her when she went to see Daniel, maybe she wouldn't have gone through those things, and Mason wouldn't have been hurt.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Let's go back," Mason said, holding Veronica's hand and walking towards the police station.</span></p></div>
