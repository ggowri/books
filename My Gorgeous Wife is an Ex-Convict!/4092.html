        <h1>Chapter 4090</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> If it weren't for those inexplicable black lines on his body, Tina really had the urge to whistle.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"> She had always known that he had a great body, and had even touched it with her own hands.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Looking at it this way, it's a different feeling and everything is more vivid.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina's gaze gradually moved down from Chandler's chest.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Unfortunately, everything below his abdomen was submerged in a pool of medicine, and the color of the medicine was like blood, making it impossible for her to see anything clearly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Tina?" Chandler's voice sounded hoarse, and his handsome face was filled with disbelief.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Hi, Chandler." Tina gave a dry smile.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Although she wanted to find Chandler, she didn't know what to say when she actually saw him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">A heavy atmosphere enveloped them once again.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">She had to say something to break the tension! Tina thought awkwardly, then licked her dry lips and said, "Um... you have a really good figure."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">As soon as the words came out, she wanted to find a hole to bury herself in.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Oh my god, what was she saying!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">This sounded like something a "pervert" would say! Although, sometimes her behavior was a bit like that!</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Um... I'm just concerned about your body. What are those black lines on your body?" Tina quickly added, hoping not to leave a bad impression on Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"How did you get here?" He asked with some difficulty, not answering the question about the black lines on his body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina then noticed that Chandler's complexion wasn't very good, and his face was covered in sweat, with large beads of sweat constantly sliding down his cheeks.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Was it because of the medicine bath? Or...</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." She walked towards him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Don't come any closer!" he suddenly shouted, his hand hanging by his side tightly clenched into a fist. "Get out now!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">It was as if he was using all his strength to say those words.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Chandler, what's wrong? You seem really uncomfortable. Should I call someone to come and check on you?" Tina asked with concern, but walked faster towards Chandler.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Stop!" Chandler yelled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina froze in her tracks and heard Chandler continue in a hoarse voice, "Tina, don't...at least don't come any closer now...otherwise, I won't be able to control myself."</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Tina was confused. What did he mean by that?</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I don't understand. Why won't you be able to control yourself if I come closer? What happened?" Tina asked, still puzzled.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">For some reason, the black lines on his body made her want to get closer, as if something was tempting her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"I..." Chandler's face suddenly changed, and he bent over, curling up slowly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">His hands tightly wrapped around his arms, the veins on the back of his hands bulging.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"What's wrong with you?" Tina was anxious and rushed forward, reaching out to check on him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">But as soon as her hand touched his body, a sudden force pulled her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">"Ah!" she exclaimed, and the next moment, she fell into the medicinal bath, the pungent smell of the medicine enveloping her whole body.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Before Tina could react, an arm had already wrapped around her waist, pulling her out of the pool. Then warm lips pressed heavily against hers.</p></div>
