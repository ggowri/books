        <h1>Chapter 139</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">In the past, Zoe would be exhilarated to face Jason in such close proximity. But now, she couldn't wait to get out of the place.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"You're here," Jason said quietly.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe put on a pitiful look and replied cautiously, "Mr. Reed, did you call for me for any specific reason?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace's expression was still confused. She did not know why Jason had made Zoe come here.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Jason smiled faintly and explained to Grace, "Sis, you still don't know about this, right? On the second night of Thanksgiving, your friend, Lina, had met Miss Stevens. She made things very difficult for your friend."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Grace was stunned for a moment, but soon she figured out the reason. That day, when they were arguing in the mall, Lina had spoken up for her. Zoe knew that Lina was her friend, so if she had met Lina, she would most likely vent her anger on her.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When Zoe heard Jason actually called Grace "Sis", her eyes had almost popped out.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"No way! In Emerald City, what woman could be called that by Jason?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">But the truth was that the one who could was a street sweeper.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Sis, do you want to know how she made things difficult for your friend that day?" Jason asked again.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"How... how did she make things difficult?" As she recalled the moment when Lina sacrificed herself for her, Grace's heart felt as if it had been clogged.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Why don't we let Miss Stevens demonstrate it for us?" Jason spoke as if he was chit-chatting casually. He got up, walked to the side of the bed, and then bent down and helped Grace put on a pair of shoes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">His movements were gentle and careful, and he even bent his knees and squatted down, holding her foot in his palm.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe felt wave after wave of shock. The fact that Jason called Grace "Sis" was already dramatic enough, and now he was helping her to put on shoes.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Just what kind of charm did Grace have for Jason to protect her like this?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">What alarmed her more was that Jason had actually asked her to demonstrate what she had done. How was she going to demonstrate it again?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">While Zoe was thinking, Grace had put on her shoes, and Jason had carried her over to the sofa. Then he said to Zoe, "Let's get started."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Start? Start what?" Zoe's face was blank. Terrence, who followed her into the ward, handed her a tissue and said gently, "Miss Stevens, please clean Miss Cummins's shoes. Just like the day when Lina cleaned yours."</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe's face changed. "What did you say? You want me to wipe her shoes?"</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"This is what Mr. Reed wants," Terrence said with a calm face.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Zoe ground her teeth and glared hatefully at Grace. How could she possibly clean the shoes of someone she despised?</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">She did not know how Grace had managed to charm Jason!</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">"Mr. Reed, this woman is just a street sweeper, and she is very good at seducing men. When she was with my brother, she played a lot of tricks. Otherwise, my brother would never have fallen in love with a woman from an ordinary family background! Mr. Reed, please don't be fooled by her!"</p></div>
