        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Further? She wondered, and after a moment, her face began to turn red. Could he be talking about... "Even if we decide to try... even if I really decide, but... if we progress too quickly, it would be too..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Progress too quickly?" He glanced at her, "Holding hands and hugging is too fast for you?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Huh?" She was stunned, then realized she had made a joke, "Just holding hands and hugging?" They used to hold hands and hug each other often.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"What else could it be?" he asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her face turned even redder, and she quickly waved her hand, "N-nothing, I didn't think of anything..." She couldn't say that what she had thought before was completely different from what he was saying now.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"If necessary, kissing might also be needed," he added after thinking for a moment.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She hesitated for a moment before stuttering, "What do you mean by 'if necessary'?"</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He stared at her. "Like this morning, when you need to prove something."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She bit her lip again, leaving a row of marks from her teeth. If she kept going, she might even break her lip.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you hate kissing me?" Mason asked.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Her gaze unconsciously fell on his lips.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Hate it? No, not at all!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Although the kiss this morning was reluctant and something she had to do because she didn't want to let him go, she didn't feel any hatred when her lips touched his. The feeling of being close to his lips even gave her a strange sense of security.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was like... he had finally returned to her side.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Do you hate it?" His voice rang out again, but this time, it was very close to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It was only then that she suddenly realized that at some point, he had already leaned in close to her, his face very close to hers, and his breath brushing against her face.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"No... I don't hate it," she murmured in response.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Really?" He stared at her, his gaze indifferent but with a hint of sharpness and fierceness, as if he could see through her heart.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Yes... really..."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His fingers stroked her lips, lightly and repeatedly, making her feel like her lips were burning, as if they were about to catch fire.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Then prove it to me," he said.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Proof? Do we need to prove it so soon?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She swallowed the saliva that suddenly secreted in her throat, and her hands, as if possessed, involuntarily lifted and stroked his cheek.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His gaze became even deeper, and her eyes met his, unable to look away, as if she wanted to completely sink into his bottomless eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She...wanted to go back to the past with him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>She wanted to rely on him like before, to share happiness and sadness with him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>During the years they were apart, she was shrouded in loneliness. Even when she was among people, she felt lonely, as if she was wearing a mask on her face every day to face others. But only in front of him could she take off this mask.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So even if she had to prove it again and again, she was willing to do so.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Mason, I won't hate you. Whatever it is, I won't hate you." As she finished speaking, she kissed his lips.</span></p></div>
