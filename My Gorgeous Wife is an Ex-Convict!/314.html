        <h1>Chapter 313</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"It's&hellip; so good." She was a little tongue-tied, and her mouth was full of the taste of the cocktail.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She should have tasted the drink slowly, but she just swallowed it all in one go. "Hadwin, what do you want me to do for you to let go of this? Tell me!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Perhaps it was the glass of cocktail that made her more daring and her voice louder.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His black eyes darkened. &ldquo;Whatever you owe me, you pay me with it now."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She tilted her head on one side, her round eyes staring at him as if she were thinking of something. "I just have to pay you with whatever I owe you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Yes," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina stood up and shook her head. The alcohol probably caught up with her and made her feel a little dizzy.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">The cocktail was just as strong as before.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, because of this, she had also become bolder and could do things that she normally could not do.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Just like how she was unzipping her coat and taking it off now.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Hadwin narrowed his eyes and looked at what Lina was doing right now. His eyes were glistening.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina took off her coat and began to take off the sweater inside. Once the sweater was on the floor, she started to take off her cotton tee...</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"What, do you think I want you?" Hadwin said coldly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Lina blinked her eyes. "You're right. You hate me so much, you probably... don't want me. You can get someone else to do it, then. Since I owe you one, you should&hellip; Uh&hellip; You should be able to let go of your fury if I return you one.&rdquo; Her tongue seemed a little bit out of control. She began to become tongue-tied as she spoke.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">His face took on a ghastly expression. He got closer to her, putting his hand under her chin. "Do you allow just anyone to do that to you?&rdquo;</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'll think of it as... being bitten by a dog. How... How else do you expect me to pay you? However... you have to keep your promise... Don't... Don't touch my mom and dad, they're just honest citizens... They've never hurt anyone in their life..." She stammered, but her voice became unusually shrill as she spoke of her parents.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He glared at her. This woman was only trying to protect her parents! Was she afraid that he would go hard on them?</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, he did not want her fear!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Do you regret it?" His face moved closer to hers, their lips almost touching. "Did you regret leaving without saying goodbye?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She stared at the beautiful face so close to her. It was so beautiful it was like the doll she had played with when she was a child.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You're so pretty," she suddenly said, grinning. Then, she put her hands on his cheek. Her fingers even moved restlessly across his face.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">At the sight of this, he knew she was probably drunk.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She was just as drunk as before. She had said the same thing back then.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She also said a lot of vows of eternal love, which completely enamored him. Had it not been for her departure the next day, that night would have been his fondest memory.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Unlike the ridicule, indifference, and the cold eyes he received since he was little, her eyes were full of warmth when she looked at him.</p></div>
