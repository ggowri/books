        <h1>Chapter 2013</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Alright, don't overthink it. No matter what happens in the future, I&rsquo;ll be there for you," he said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">His melodious voice was not loud, but it could appease her somewhat uneasy heart.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It was as if she had nothing to be afraid of when he was around!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">On the other hand, Grace took Nelson and Kyla to the nearby hospital. The doctor examined Nelson and found that the wounds he suffered in the fight were only some skin injuries. They were not serious. However, even if they ordered a new hearing aid now, it would take at least a week.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">It also meant Nelson would not be able to hear for a week.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace pondered about it and said to Kyla, "Then let&rsquo;s Nelson take a leave of absence from school and return a week later with the new hearing aid. Otherwise, it would be inconvenient for him to attend classes."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla replied gently, "That's all we can do now. I'll withdraw the money I owe you for the hearing aid tomorrow, but... Maybe it won't be enough, so later&mdash;"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Before Kyla could finish, Grace interrupted her. "Kyla, I'm just getting my godson a new hearing aid. Why are you paying me back? Do you have to make yourself such a stranger?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla's eyes reddened.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">In the small room at night, Kyla looked at her son, who was already asleep. She said to her mother, "Mom, was I wrong?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"What did you do wrong? It's not your fault that Nelson got hurt today." Mrs. Corbyn comforted her daughter.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I gave birth to him, but I can&rsquo;t give him a good life. I took fever-reducing medicine when I was pregnant, which made him deaf and discriminated against. I forced him to stay with me but can&rsquo;t be his strong backer," Kyla said bitterly.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">What happened in the discipline office today showed her how much injustice her son was suffering from at school.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, he had never mentioned them in front of her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">If Hadwin Stephenson had not shown up and Grace was not the mistress of the Reed family, then things might not have ended so easily.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Although she never envied any position or power, sometimes the difference could be so striking!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If Nelson was with Martin Weiss, he&rsquo;d be the heir of the Weiss family. No one would dare to bully him and discriminate against him," murmured Kyla.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Mrs. Corbyn froze. Then, as if realizing something, she asked, "You... You're not thinking of handing Nelson to Martin Weiss, are you?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Kyla was silent.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">However, her silence told Mrs. Corbyn that it was indeed what her daughter had in mind. "How could you hand Nelson to Martin Weiss? Nelson has always hated Martin Weiss! Besides, would you be in jail if it wasn't for him? Would Nelson be deaf?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But Nelson is the Weiss family's only child. At least, Nelson's the only child Martin Weiss has. If he&rsquo;s in the Weiss family, the Weiss family will at least give him enough protection. He'll... have a better future than if he were to stay with me."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The wealth and status of the Weiss family was something she could not give to her son!</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"But Nelson has a flaw. Families like the Weiss family won't want him at all. Martin Weiss can just get a wife and give birth to plenty of healthy children!" said Mrs. Corbyn.</p></div>
