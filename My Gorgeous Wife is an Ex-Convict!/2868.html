        <h1>Chapter 2866</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller only looked straight at the operating room door without glancing at Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">When Grace was wheeled out of the operating room, she was still in a coma because of the anesthetic. Valda Theller accompanied her to the ward. Envy flickered in her eyes when she saw Jason guarding the hospital bed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Everyone in Emerald City knew Young master Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Rumor had it that Young master Reed was cold and heartless, but he loved his wife very much.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Having requited love was something many people were after but failed to get. For example... her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Kyla, I'll go back first," Valda Theller said to Kyla nearby.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla said, "I'll go back with you and come back tomorrow to see Grace."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Therefore, they bade Jason goodbye and walked out of the ward.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, Valda Theller stopped as soon as she left the ward. Brian was standing in the corridor not far away, looking straight at her.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller pressed her lips slightly, turned to Kyla, and said, "Kyla, go ahead first. I have something to say to Brian."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla felt uneasy. After all, Valda was too calm.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Any woman would be devastated to hear her boyfriend care so much about the person he once liked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">However, there was no anger or sadness on Valda's face. All it had was... calmness.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Such calmness made Kyla feel like a storm was coming.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, are you okay?" Kyla asked.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I'm fine. Don't worry," said Valda Theller.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Kyla hesitated and left. After all, it was between Valda and Brian. A stranger like her could not interfere.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian and Valda Theller were the only two left in the corridor.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller walked up to Brian. "Grace's still in a coma because her anesthesia hasn't worn off."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian frowned slightly. "I didn't ask that."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I thought you wanted to know," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He said suddenly, "I'm sorry! I know I shouldn't have done that today."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Valda Theller's eyelashes quivered slightly before she looked down. "What are you referring to? Do you mean you shouldn't have walked away when you saw me getting mobbed? Or do you mean you shouldn't have said the things outside the operating room?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">Brian was flabbergasted. He felt embarrassed as he had no idea how to answer her question.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"You did nothing wrong. I know you love Grace, not me." Valda Theller laughed at herself. "I know you must have left the comic fiesta so quickly because you got a call that Grace is in critical condition. Besides, you said that outside the operating room because you love Grace and were worried about her."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">She said it all in a plain tone.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">It was clear that she was not blaming him, but he would have preferred her to blame him and lose her temper rather than be so calm. It made him worried.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"Valda, you can blame me," said Brian.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">"I don't blame you," she said.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.85pt;">He looked at her with an inquisitive look.</p></div>
