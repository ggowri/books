        <div><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Calvert held the medicine and stared blankly at Harley's departure.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Is it because he looks too pitiful? </span><span>So</span><span> the princess of the Hart family came out to help him and buy him medicine?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These medicines seem particularly heavy in their hands.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When facing Harley, he always feels a sense of inferiority, which makes him want to escape.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>But when Harley really left, he had an urge to catch up with her and catch her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>At this moment, Calvert forcefully suppressed his impulse until Harley's figure completely disappeared before his eyes before he walked toward his dark and dilapidated home.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps this cannot be called home at all.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's just a shelter for him!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>When he opened the door, a familiar musty smell once again flooded into his nose.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The rotten and moldy smell in this dilapidated house always accompanies him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Perhaps his whole person is also slowly decaying like this room.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The more I grow up, the more I broaden my horizons and understand how difficult it is to change my life!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>He took off his coat and looked at the bruises on his body, new and old as if there were always wounds on him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the wounds on his body have never been cared about.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Just Calvert's gaze fell on the drugs, which Harley gave him.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Does this mean that she cares about his wounds?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>On the other side, Harley sat in the car, looking at the message sent by the secretary of the Quentin family on his phone.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>A week later, the Quentin family will hold Lornell's grandfather's birthday banquet and ask if she will attend.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley smiled wryly. Throughout, many things about the Quentin family have been sent messages or emails by the secretary, rather than Lornell communicating with her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>This makes her feel like an outsider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Alternatively, in the eyes of the Quentin family, she is now just Lornell's fianc&eacute;e and not married, so she is indeed an outsider.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>So</span><span> for Lornell, does she also exist as an outsider?</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley responded and of course, she will attend the birthday banquet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And the Hart family has already prepared the gift.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>And it wasn't until the day before the banquet that Harley received Lornell's phone call: "</span><span>Tomorrow</span><span> I'll pick you up and attend my grandfather's birthday party together."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>For an instant, Harley had an indescribable complex feeling in his heart, "I have already told my parents that tomorrow I will go to the banquet with them."</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>These days, she has been waiting for his call, but he hasn't called yet.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>The secretary of the Quentin family was also explaining some of the attendance matters at the banquet to her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It's like he can't even spare a little time for her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>In the eyes of others, fianc&eacute;e should have been an intimate identity, but for him, she is probably only stronger than strangers.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>"Is that right? That's good. "Lornell's voice came faintly from the other end of his phone, and he hung up immediately. The phone kept hearing the sound of ending the call.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley only felt bitter in his mouth.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>It seems that he was just saying it for real, and even after she refused, he just replied briefly and ended the conversation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>His attitude is undoubtedly silently telling her that he doesn't love her!</span></p><p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><span>Harley gently lowered his eyes and looked at the phone in his hand... Yeah, she knows better than anyone the fact that he doesn't love her, right?</span></p></div>
