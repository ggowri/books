        <h1>Chapter 2177</h1>
        <div><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Boo-hoo. Mommy, what should I do? I misunderstood William. I don't want him to hate me. I don't want to be unable to see him again. I... I miss him. I want to apologize to him! Boo-hoo..." said Jasper as she wept. Big teardrops kept falling from her face. </p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace gently hugged her daughter and comforted her gently. "Alright, stop crying. Stop crying. William isn't that petty. He'll forgive you if you apologize to him sincerely."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Yes... Yes... I&rsquo;ll apologize... I&rsquo;ll apologize to him sincerely..." The little one cried and nodded her little head. She was a little out of breath.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I'll take you to Deer City to visit William someday. Then you can apologize to him, okay?" said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jasper answered, "Okay. When... When are you taking me? Mommy, I want to see William as soon as possible. I want to quickly apologize to him and make up with him!"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"I have to find out where exactly William is staying now and speak to William's daddy before we can go over. I'll arrange it as soon as possible," said Grace.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Just then, Mick Reed suddenly said, "I want to go too."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace paused. "You want to go too?"</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Since Tristas and I misunderstood him that day, we both have to apologize, of course," replied Mick Reed.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace thought about it and said, "Okay, we'll go together, then."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace told Jason about William being wronged and that she wanted to take their son and daughter to Deer City to see William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Now that we&rsquo;ve found out the truth, we have to let William know about it even though he's no longer in Emerald City. Also, Jasper and Mick want to apologize to him. I think it's a good thing that they're apologetic, so I want to bring them there,&rdquo; said Grace. It would be an unforgettable experience for the children.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">The children would soon understand that what they saw was not necessarily true and would think more before making conclusions.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you want to go, I'll go with you," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You'll go with me?" She paused. "But your work..."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"If you can take a break from work and go to Deer City with the kids, why can't I?" He smiled. "Besides, I'll take care of the company. Don't worry."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Grace thought for a moment, nodded, and said, "Do you have the Barlow family's contact number? I want to call them and fix a date for a visit."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Jason smiled. "Leave it to me. I'll contact the Barlow family."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Once Grace went into the bathroom, Jason picked up his phone and dialed Philip Barlow's private number.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">This number was also the number Philip Barlow had given to William.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">When the call got through, Jason said, "It&rsquo;s Jason."</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young master Reed, why are you calling me out of the blue?" asked Philip Barlow, who was on the other end of the line. He had a certain fondness for Jason, who had taken care of his son for a while despite having bad blood with Lily. Otherwise, his son would have been in a worse situation when he found him.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"You picked up William without saying a word. I&rsquo;m calling to ask for an explanation, of course," said Jason.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">"Young master Reed, if you didn't want me to pick him up, I wouldn't have been able to pick him up, would I?" asked Philip Barlow.</p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 7.8pt;">Both men were sensible enough that some things could be left unsaid.</p></div>
